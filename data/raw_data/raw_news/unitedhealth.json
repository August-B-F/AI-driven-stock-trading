            "content": "Since the start of the artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) boom, the healthcare sector has been lagging the S&P 500, with investors parking their funds primarily in mega-cap tech and growth stocks. Healthcare has been one of the S&P 500\u2019s worst-performing sectors over the past two years. It grew just 2.5% in 2024 compared with the benchmark index\u2019s 23.3% jump.\n\nWhile the healthcare sector's weighting in the S&P 500 has declined to a 25-year low of about 10%, total U.S. healthcare spending has more than tripled in roughly the same period, from $1.4 trillion in 2000 to $4.9 trillion in 2023. The segment has witnessed major technological upheavals that should have a long-standing impact. Growth in key areas like telehealth, surgery, data analytics and biotechnology have aided in a big way.\n\nThe current year started with visible underperformance in the sector, channeled by skepticism over the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health Secretary. However, while RFK Jr. has long been a vaccine skeptic and some of his past comments have criticized groundbreaking drug developments, during the confirmation hearing, he distanced himself from the anti-vaccine movement and voiced support for HIV treatment and prevention drugs. As a result, healthcare as a sector has picked up, with some semblance of confidence returning. In fact, the S&P 500 Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) has grown 6.9% year to date as of March 20, after the bloodbath witnessed in the last quarter of 2024.\n\nAn aging population has also helped the sector grow. Moreover, these stocks are considered defensive, meaning they tend to remain stable regardless of the prevalent market conditions. Regular demand for healthcare services is not dependent on the peaks and troughs of a market that has risen and fallen over the past two years over the Fed\u2019s monetary policy.\n\nThe healthcare sector is poised for significant long-term changes, including the integration of AI in medical research. The sector also seems lucrative for investors looking for a steady cash flow, as pharmaceutical companies are known to offer regular dividends. While it is not having a great time currently, with the measures in place and the new technology delivering them, the time may be ripe to invest in the sector.\n\nHence, astute investors should bet on healthcare mutual funds at present. Mutual funds, in general, reduce transaction costs and diversify portfolios without an array of commission charges that are mostly associated with stock purchases (read more: Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money).\n\nOur Picks\n\nWe have thus selected three such healthcare mutual funds that boast a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), have positive three-year and five-year annualized returns, minimum initial investments within $5000, and carry a low expense ratio.\n\nT.

They say he's a hero who has taken a stand against America's broken healthcare system.\n\nThey are also planning to protest the conditions within the jail where he's being held.\n\nThe protest, according to the website, will aim to bring attention to 'inhumane' conditions inside the Metropolitan Detention Center, and 'demand justice' for those behind bars.\n\nUnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson was shot dead in Manhattan in December\n\nThe top donation to Luigi's fund has so far been $36,500.\n\nThe mystery donor left a cryptic message behind.\n\n'What intrigues me about this case is how unified folks' responses are regardless of strata.\n\n'In Corporate America, for instance, there has been widespread doubt of potential prosecutorial mishandling and overcharging.\n\n'I've also been surprised at the almost ubiquitous nature of support towards the suspect that I would expect to be quite bifurcated in this type of litigation.

            "content": "The organizer of an online campaign that has raised more than $700,000 for Luigi Mangione\u2019s legal defense in connection with the fatal shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, believes the accused killer\u2019s infamous, post-arrest \u201cperp walk\u201d may have \u201cbackfired\u201d on New York authorities and spurred some of his financial support.\n\nIn remarks on an upcoming podcast exploring Mangione\u2019s case, Sam Beard says the campaign eclipsed its goal by more than double after the public saw authorities \u201ctreating him like Hannibal Lecter\u201d, referring to the fictional serial killer antagonist in the film The Silence of the Lambs.\n\n\u201cTo just demonstrate the sheer power of this state and \u2026 to really just show how captured and how small this person is \u2026 a lot of us feel like that maybe backfired,\u201d Beard says on Luigi, a four-episode Law & Crime podcast set to premiere on Monday \u2013 and an excerpt of which was shared with the Guardian.\n\nBeard\u2019s comments are some of the most extensive yet about his work on the Luigi Mangione Official Defense Fund, which had raised about $748,000 as of Friday morning on the GiveSendGo platform.\n\nAs the podcast notes, critics of the campaign say it dangerously glorifies vigilante violence and disrespects the family of Thompson, whose killing on 4 December 2024 was seen by many as an extreme, illicit protest of both the US\u2019s rapacious private health insurance industry and the wealthy executives who profit off routine coverage denials.\n\nYet Beard and those who have supported the Mangione fund launched by his December 4th Legal Committee counter that everyone deserves a fair trial, including him. And, as a high-profile defendant, Mangione is grappling with a disproportionately intense prosecution, they maintain.\n\nA clear instance of that, Beard says on the Law & Crime podcast, was when Mangione was extradited to New York from where he had been arrested in Pennsylvania. Beard alluded to the way dozens of New York police officers \u2013 including ones equipped with body armor and long guns \u2013 greeted a shackled Mangione at the helicopter in which he arrived and then escorted him to a waiting vehicle.\n\nThe group surrounding Mangione \u2013 clad in an orange prisoner\u2019s jumpsuit \u2013 was joined by the New York mayor, Eric Adams, as television news cameras recorded the dramatic scene, unfolding about 15 days after the Thompson shooting.\n\n\u201cWe just saw how spectacular they really made that moment,\u201d Beard remarks on the podcast.\n\nYet the show of strength did not isolate Mangione, who is facing state and federal charges of murder as well as terrorism \u2013 allegations which could mean the death penalty for him if he is convicted.\n\nBy late January, about 11,000 donors contributing roughly $30 each had helped the Mangione defense fund eclipse its initial goal of $300,000. That amount then more than doubled, prompting Beard\u2019s group to increase the campaign\u2019s goal to $1m.\n\nIn February, Mangione\u2019s attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, announced that her client \u2013 who has pleaded not guilty in the case \u2013 would accept the money raised for his legal defense.\n\n\u201cI know [that was] extremely meaningful to the well over 12,000 donors,\u201d Beard says on the podcast. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful for the opportunity to help.\u201d\n\nAuthorities allege that Mangione, 26, shot Thompson, 50, to death in plain view of a surveillance camera as he walked to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. A five-day manhunt led to Mangione\u2019s arrest in a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s.\n\nInvestigators say he had a gun that matched the one used to kill Thompson, fake identification that Mangione allegedly used to check into a New York City hostel before the deadly shooting, and a notebook expressing disdain for US healthcare companies\u2019 practices.\n\nAccording to the insurer, Mangione was never a client of UnitedHealthcare. But he had cut himself off from friends and relatives in the months before his arrest, posting frequently in online forums about struggling with back pain \u2013 details which are examined on the Luigi podcast.\n\nA poll published in late December by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago concluded that most people in the US believe the health insurance\u2019s frequent denials of coverage shared some responsibility for the death of Thompson, whose survivors include his widow and two teenage sons.\n\nBut the survey found most people in the US believed Thompson\u2019s killer had either \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of responsibility for his death.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when anybody has their life cut short by another person, especially when it could have been prevented,\u201d Beard says on Mangione. \u201cBut the same logic has to apply both ways, right?\n\n\u201cPreventing people from getting the healthcare that they need \u2013 that you and your company have access to and could provide them, but don\u2019t do so because it would threaten your business model \u2013 that\u2019s an act of violence too,\u201d Beard says.",

            "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about UnitedHealth Group (UNH) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nUnitedHealth currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.06, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.06 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 23 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 92% and 8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for UNH\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for UNH\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for UnitedHealth here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying UnitedHealth, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -1.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -7.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has gained 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nUnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $7.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $29.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $33.33 indicates a change of +12.5% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $111.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $451.2 billion and $487.14 billion estimates indicate +12.7% and +8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nUnitedHealth reported revenues of $100.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.8%. EPS of $6.81 for the same period compares with $6.16 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $102.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +1.49%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nUnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Ian Gerald Patrick Wace serves as the firm\u2019s chief executive officer and chief risk officer. Despite not holding a college degree, he has achieved exceptional success in the finance industry, earning recognition as \u201cperhaps the only person without a college degree to ever qualify\u201d for Institutional Investor\u2019s Rich List. Wace began his career at S.G. Warburg & Co., where he spent 11 years and became the firm\u2019s youngest director at the age of 25. His rapid ascent continued as he was appointed head of European equity sales in 1988, head of proprietary trading in 1993, and head of international trading in 1994. In 1995, he joined Deutsche Morgan Grenfell as head of equity and derivative trading, further establishing his expertise in the financial sector before co-founding Marshall Wace in 1997.\n\nPolitically, Marshall was initially a member and donor of the Liberal Democrats, co-editing the influential Orange Book in 2004 alongside key party figures. However, his stance shifted in 2015 when he left the party due to his support for Brexit. He later became a major donor to the Brexit campaign and the Conservative Party. His ownership of UnHerd and GB News has positioned him as a significant right-wing media figure in the UK.\n\nBeyond finance, Marshall is best known as a philanthropist and media baron. He expanded his influence into media by owning UnHerd and The Spectator and co-owning GB News. His philanthropic efforts are equally notable; he was named the top donor on The Sunday Times Giving List in 2024 after donating a hefty sum to various causes including the London School of Economics to establish the Marshall Institute. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for his contributions to education and philanthropy.\n\nSir Paul Roderick Clucas Marshall, known simply as Paul Marshall, serves as the chairman and chief investment officer of Marshall Wace. Born in London, England, he studied history and modern languages at St John\u2019s College, Oxford before earning an MBA from INSEAD Business School in Fontainebleau, France. Prior to co-founding Marshall Wace, Marshall was the Head of European Equities at Mercury Asset Management.\n\nMarshall Wace LLP is a prominent British hedge fund established in 1997 by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace. Headquartered in London, the firm has grown to become one of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds. The firm operates as a unified global team, dedicated to fostering long-term client relationships built on trust and integrity, with a culture centered on continuous innovation and improvement.\n\nWe recently published a list of Top 10 Stocks to Buy According to Marshall Wace LLP . In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other top stocks to buy according to Marshall Wace LLP.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMarshall Wace LLP manages quantitative, systematic, and fundamental investment strategies, with a primary focus on long/short equity. These strategies are implemented on a global scale, utilizing proprietary systems and processes to optimize performance. For over two decades, technology and data have been central to the firm\u2019s operations. In 2002, Marshall Wace introduced MW TOPS, its Trade Optimized Portfolio System and the world\u2019s first \u2018Alpha Capture\u2019 application. This revolutionized the way investment insights were harnessed and contributed largely to its prominence in the hedge fund industry. Today, the firm remains committed to innovation and excellence, continuously refining its methodologies to maintain a competitive edge in the financial markets. Despite its success, Marshall Wace has faced recent challenges; in the fiscal year ending February 2024, the firm\u2019s revenues declined substantially, leading to a nearly 64% drop in profits.\n\nMarshall Wace LLP\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filing reported over $83 billion in managed 13F securities, with its top 10 holdings accounting for 34.5% of the total portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe stocks discussed below were picked from Marshall Wace LLP\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings. They are compiled in the ascending order of the hedge fund\u2019s stake in them as of December 31, 2024.

The company experienced a rise in its medical cost ratio to 85.5%, exceeding the projected 84.96%, driven by increased utilization of healthcare services under Medicare plans. Despite this, UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum healthcare services division showed strong performance, growing 9% to $65.1 billion. Additionally, the company posted earnings per share of $6.81, surpassing estimates. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reaffirmed its 2025 profit outlook, projecting full-year revenue between $450 billion and $455 billion, demonstrating confidence in its long-term strategy.\n\nThe stock has faced challenges, declining 25.7% from its November 2024 peak of $630.73, significantly underperforming the broader healthcare sector. Over the last three months, shares have dropped nearly 23%, remaining below key technical benchmarks such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. However, analysts maintain a positive outlook, assigning the stock a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and setting an average price target of $639.21, which implies a potential 36.4% upside. While UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) has encountered short-term setbacks, its continued expansion in Optum and strong full-year revenue guidance reinforce its long-term growth prospects, making it an attractive investment at its current valuation.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\u2019s revenue growth has been fueled by the rapid expansion of its OptumHealth division, which provides healthcare services through affiliated medical groups. From 2022 to 2024, OptumHealth\u2019s revenue soared by 48%, outpacing the company\u2019s overall revenue growth of 23%, driven by a greater number of patients under value-based care models, including at-home services. Additionally, UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance business saw over 20% growth in both its Medicaid and Medicare segments, supported by an increase in customer enrollments.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\u2019s strong market position, expanding OptumHealth division, and consistent revenue growth make it one of the top stocks to buy. Despite short-term challenges, its solid fundamentals, strategic investments, and analyst-backed upside potential position it as a compelling long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Amazon, ServiceNow, and Gartner during the quarter. We trimmed our position in UnitedHealth to fund the purchase of CoStar Group. Despite short-term margin headwinds, our long-term expectations for UnitedHealth Group remain virtually unchanged, with the trim simply reflecting what we view as a superior investment alternative.\u201d\n\nOverall, UNH ranks 6th on our list of top stocks to buy according to Marshall Wace LLP. While we acknowledge the potential for UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nOptum Rx is moving to eliminate prior authorizations on dozens of drugs, the UnitedHealth-owned pharmacy benefit manager said Wednesday, paring back a key pain point for physicians and patients at a time of widespread discontent with middlemen in the healthcare industry.\n\nStarting May 1, Optum Rx will eliminate reauthorizations \u2014 when drugs already being used by a patient need to be reapproved by their plan \u2014 for roughly 80 drugs. The program will cut up to 25% of all reauthorizations, or 10% of prior authorizations overall, the PBM said.\n\nThe drugs included treat high cholesterol, lung disease, multiple sclerosis, migraines and more. Optum Rx said it plans to apply the policy to additional drugs in the future.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPrior authorization requires doctors to get approval from a patient\u2019s health or drug plan before providing a medical service, like performing surgery or prescribing a medication. Insurers and PBMs argue prior authorization is important to reduce nonessential healthcare costs and ensure treatment is safe and effective.\n\nHowever, doctors say the process increases paperwork burden and delays care plans. Some patients have experienced severe health outcomes or even died following prior authorization holdups.\n\nAs a result, pressure has been rising on health and drug plans to roll back the policies. In the past few years, a number of major payers have walked back prior authorizations, including Optum Rx\u2019s sister company UnitedHealthcare and CVS-owned Aetna.\n\nStill, physicians argue more reform is needed \u2014 especially as payers automate prior authorization processes, sparking concerns about algorithms driving improper denials.\n\nReauthorizations are occasionally necessary to ensure that the ongoing use of drug is safe, that the current dosage is appropriate and that a patient doesn\u2019t need additional testing, according to Optum Rx. But for many drugs, there is \u201cminimal additional value\u201d in reauthorization, the PBM said in its Wednesday release.\n\nNixing reauthorizations is meant to simplify patient experiences, expand access to medications and reduce work for pharmacists and doctors, Patrick Conway, the CEO of Optum Rx, said in a statement.\n\nDrugs included in the program don\u2019t present an added safety risk for patients, have established long-term effectiveness and constant dose requirements, a spokesperson for the PBM said.\n\nPatients using the drugs also have to have an established diagnosis of a chronic condition, and have considered alternative therapy for authorization to be waived.\n\nFuture drugs that will be considered for the program will follow the same clinical criteria, the spokesperson said.\n\nOptum Rx will no longer require reauthorization for Amgen\u2019s Repatha, Novartis\u2019 Leqvio, Pfizer\u2019s Nurtec and other major drugs The drugs included in Optum Rx's new program, by clinical indication\n\nReducing prior authorizations is also a savvy PR move for Optum Rx, one of the so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d U.S. PBMs that have been targeted by antitrust regulators and lawmakers for their alleged role in driving up drug costs.\n\nCritics of major PBMs point to opaque contracts, rebating practices and significant market consolidation in calling for Washington to curb the drug middlemen. However, despite rising momentum on the Hill resulting in a number of proposed bills and an ongoing legal spat with the Federal Trade Commission, concrete changes have yet to be imposed on PBMs.\n\nSpurred by public pressure \u2014 and a rising number of upstart pharmacy benefits competitors \u2014 major PBMs including Optum have announced a number of internal changes that they say make them more straightforward and effective.\n\nIn doing so, they\u2019re likely seeking to protect lucrative businesses from external reform. Optum Rx, for example, brought in $5.8 billion in profit last year, almost one-fifth of UnitedHealth\u2019s overall operating earnings\n\nIn January, Optum Rx announced it would phase out models that allow it to retain savings from negotiations with drugmakers over the next three years.\n\nOptum Rx and the other members of the Big Three \u2014 Cigna-owned Express Scripts and CVS-owned Caremark \u2014 have also launched \u201ctransparent\u201d PBM models based on the net cost of drugs, a move analysts say is likely in response to client ire over confusing business practices and meant to offset political and regulatory scrutiny.",

            "content": "Major healthcare plan provider UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH is currently viewed as expensive, with the stock trading at a 16.61X forward 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E), which is at a premium compared with the Zacks Medical \u2013 HMOs industry average of 14.47X. This valuation generally reflects the market\u2019s strong confidence in the company's future prospects. UnitedHealth has a Value Score of B at present.\n\nHowever, it is important to closely evaluate whether this elevated price is justified based on its growth prospects, fundamentals and prevailing market conditions. UNH is still trading below its five-year median of 19.19X. Meanwhile, other health insurers, such as Humana Inc. HUM and Elevance Health, Inc. ELV, are currently trading at 17.21X and 12.41X, respectively.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s Price Performance\n\nOver the past six months, UNH shares have dropped 12.3%, slightly outperforming the industry\u2019s 12.8% decline but lagging the S&P 500\u2019s 0.2% dip. In comparison, Humana and Elevance have slipped 14% and 19.1%, respectively, over the same period.\n\n6-Month Price Performance \u2013 UNH, HUM, ELV, Industry & S&P 500\n\nHeadwinds Facing UnitedHealth\n\nUnitedHealth stock has been under pressure since the tragic December shooting of top executive Brian Thompson, wiping out nearly $100 billion in market value at one point. The company is also facing heightened scrutiny amid growing public criticism of the health insurance industry.\n\nAdding to its headaches, increasing medical costs continue to erode margins. In the fourth quarter, medical expenses climbed to $67 billion from $62.2 billion a year earlier. Its 2024 medical care ratio (MCR) increased to 85.5% from 83.2% in 2023. A higher MCR means the company is retaining a smaller portion of premiums after paying claims. Elevated drug prices in the United States remain a key driver of rising costs.\n\nRegulatory risks are also mounting. Lawmakers continue to push for healthcare reforms, with some advocating for the breakup of large pharmacy benefit managers like UnitedHealth\u2019s OptumRx, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of the insurers. President Donald Trump has vowed to eliminate \"middlemen\" in the drug supply chain. These uncertainties could impact UnitedHealth\u2019s long-term profitability.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s Growth Drivers\n\nDespite these challenges, Eden Prairie, MN-based UNH is actively managing costs through contract negotiations and improved patient discharge processes. Investments in AI and digital healthcare solutions aim to enhance efficiency and reduce expenses.\n\nOptum Health, a key growth driver, is set to serve 5.4 million value-based care patients this year, an increase of 650,000 from 2023. UnitedHealth remains well-positioned to capitalize on rising healthcare spending in the United States, driven by an aging population and growing disease prevalence. Its scale, market expansions and diversification efforts should help mitigate margin pressures from slower private Medicare rate growth.\n\nThe company also maintains a strong track record of shareholder returns. In 2024, UnitedHealth rewarded shareholders with more than $16 billion in share repurchases and dividends, and its long-term earnings potential suggests further dividend growth ahead. Its dividend yield of 1.67% is higher than the industry average of 1.57%.\n\nAdditionally, its total debt-to-capital of 42.41% is lower than the industry average of 43.74%. It exited the fourth quarter of 2024 with cash and short-term investments of $29.1 billion, which can easily manage its short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt of $4.6 billion.\n\nUNH\u2019s Estimates & Surprise History\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth\u2019s 2025 and 2026 EPS implies a 6.8% and 12.5% uptick, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The estimates remained stable over the past month. Moreover, the consensus mark for 2025 and 2026 revenues suggests a 12.7% and 8% increase, respectively. UnitedHealth has beaten earnings expectations for four straight quarters, with an average surprise of 2.5%.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s Price Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 24 analysts, the Wall Street average price target is at $637.13 per share, suggesting a 27.68% upside from current levels.\n\nUNH Wall Street Price Target\n\nVerdict: Is UnitedHealth Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nWhile UNH and the broader industry are facing regulatory uncertainties and growing medical costs, the company\u2019s long-term prospects remain strong, supporting its above-industry-average price tag. While the current headwinds may deter new investors from buying at these levels, existing shareholders may find it worth holding.\n\nOverall, the outlook is largely neutral for UnitedHealth shares at present. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For these drugs, adherence over time is the major benefit,\" said Patrick Conway, CEO of Optum Rx. \"You want patients to maintain their cystic fibrosis, asthma and diabetes drug because it maintains their health and their total cost of care.\"\n\nThe killing of a UnitedHealth executive last December had set off an outpouring of complaints about insurance on social media, including UnitedHealthcare and other insurers' requirements to seek their approval on medicines and medical services.\n\nIn January this year, UnitedHealth said during a conference call with investors that it would work with policymakers to reduce the frequency of prior authorizations required before a patient can access medical treatment in its Medicare business for people aged 65 and older or with disabilities.\n\nReauthorizations, or certain checks that patients need to go through to continue receiving their medications, are necessary for drugs that have safety concerns, or need ongoing monitoring for adjusting doses, or additional tests, UnitedHealth's unit said.\n\nNewly approved drugs for diseases such as Alzheimer's require ongoing review, whereas with genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis, there is minimal additional value in reauthorizing a treatment, the company said.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Conway said he expected the change to be received positively by lawmakers, who scrutinized prior authorization practices in state and federal legislatures last year.\n\nHowever, Robert Popovian, founder of healthcare consultancy Conquest Advisors, said the program's emphasis on reauthorization is too narrow to reduce the administrative burden of prior authorizations across medical services.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers negotiate drug prices and create coverage lists for health plans, mainly for employers and the government. They pay pharmacies directly for prescription drugs under their agreed terms.\n\nCVS Health's Caremark, Cigna's Express Scripts and UnitedHealth's Optum control the majority of the U.S. pharmacy benefit market, with their parent companies also operating health insurance and pharmacy businesses.\n\nThey have come under scrutiny for their role in driving up costs for drugs. President Donald Trump has also said he wants to knock out these middlemen.\n\n(Reporting by Sriparna Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Nia Williams)",

A biography on her law firm website says she played a lead role in prosecuting \"high-profile violent crime cases,\" including those involving mental health and cold case homicides.\n\nMangione, 26, is in custody at a Pennsylvania state prison after a judge denied bail on Tuesday.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where he was arrested Monday, Mangione faces charges including allegedly possessing an untraceable ghost gun.

(Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)\n\nTip from San Francisco\n\nThe FBI\u2019s New York Field Office said Friday that among the multiple tips the agency received was a tip from police in San Francisco \"regarding the possible identity of the suspect.\" The FBI said it \"conducted routine investigative activity and referred this and other leads to the New York City Police Department.\"\n\nThe NYPD previously said none of the hundreds of tips it received included Mangione's identity.\n\nThe NYPD confirmed Friday it received the FBI tip but that it was not passed along by the agency in a manner that distinguished it as being from another law enforcement agency.\n\nThe tip was subsequently not prioritized the way it might have been had NYPD detectives known it was coming from another police department, the NYPD said.\n\nThe NYPD had dispatched detectives to Georgia to follow leads that came in from Atlanta police. The NYPD did not do that kind of follow-up with the San Francisco tip because, an NYPD source said, of the way it was passed along by the FBI.\n\nMORE: What to know about ghost guns after one used in killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said Friday he believes Mangione was radicalized while he attended the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Here you have a young man who went to an Ivy League school, came from an affluent background and family, had all the things that many Americans would like to have. But he found himself hating corporations and hating other things,\" Adams said on GMGT Live\u2019s \"The Reset Talk Show.\" \"We're radicalizing our children in general, but specifically on these Ivy League campuses.\"\n\nMangione's writings, obtained by ABC News, claimed that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world, but ranks about No. 42 in life expectancy. He said UnitedHealthcare \"has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit.\"\n\n\"I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done,\" he allegedly wrote. \"Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\"\n\nNeither Mangione nor his parents received insurance through UnitedHealthcare, according to UnitedHealth Group.\n\nPHOTO: This undated photo provided by UnitedHealth Group shows UnitedHealthcare chief executive officer Brian Thompson. (UnitedHealth Group via AP)\n\nThompson's murder ignited online anger at the health insurance industry and some people online have celebrated Mangione. Supporters of Mangione have donated money to a defense fund established for him, leaving law enforcement officials worried Mangione is being turned into a martyr.\n\nAdams attributed the support Mangione is receiving to \"anger and pain.\"\n\n\"People know how challenging it is navigating our health care system on many levels, the cost of health care system. Some of the denials, some of the of illnesses that are not covered. And all across America, people have experienced that disappointment. And so you're seeing a response to that,\" Adams said. \"And we can't send a signal that if you're angry over something, if you're angry because you got a parking ticket, you respond with violence.\"\n\nPHOTO: A member of the New York City police department's Crime Scene Unit at the scene where UnitedHealthcare's CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in in New York, Dec. 4, 2024.

A similar Apple Intelligence feature was scaled back earlier this year after news-related summaries served up incorrect information, including incorrectly claiming the UnitedHealth CEO had shot himself.\n\nNotification summaries on Apple Intelligence still work for things like messages, and that appears to be the route Google is taking.

The strategist opines that there is a possibility of ~10% \u2013 15% bounce over the coming months. In an interview with CNBC, he stated his expectations about March, April, and May witnessing the rally. Therefore, missing critical trading days can be a mistake for investors.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nLee believes that investors can consider buying as the markets are unsettled. In an interview with CNBC, he went on to explain that the market\u2019s 10 best days last year resulted in the addition of up to 20 percentage points for the broader S&P 500. However, if we exclude these 10 days, the index increased by only 4%. According to him, the best days might be around the corner. If there are tensions related to the growth or related to the employment market, Trump or the US Fed can intervene to bring some stability. These are the favourable catalysts for the upcoming weeks, says Lee. Overall, he believes that a large chunk of the bad news has been priced in as markets have seen a significant decline.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nSigns of Economic Strength Remain\n\nMorningstar, while echoing the views of Adam Hetts (Janus Henderson Investors portfolio manager), mentioned that the longer-term perspective is expected to provide investors a silver lining. Hetts believes that there are bright spots in the international markets such as Europe and China, that have surpassed the performance of the US stocks since the beginning of the year. Even though the mega-cap tech stocks have been declining, they are getting cheaper as compared with the elevated valuations just a few months ago.\n\nAccording to experts, there are several signs of economic strength. Gus Faucher, chief economist for PNC Financial Services Group, told Morningstar that consumers continue to spend amidst weakness in the sentiment data. Also, the labor market has been holding up. Overall, the chief economist doesn\u2019t see any sort of fundamental weaknesses in the broader economy that can signal a problem. As per Morningstar chief US market strategist David Sekera, the investors are required to focus on the fundamentals and valuations, while maintaining a long-term view.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nNevada intends to award new Medicaid managed care contracts to UnitedHealth, Centene, Elevance, Molina and nonprofit health plan CareSource, according to state documents released Wednesday.\n\nCentene added a few rural counties, UnitedHealth lost one populous county and CareSource entered Nevada for the first time. But if Nevada divvies out contracts as intended, it shouldn\u2019t dramatically change the current makeup of Medicaid managed care in the state, according to an analyst.\n\nThe new contracts begin Jan. 1, 2026.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNevada sent out a request for Medicaid contract proposals in October that would expand its managed care program to cover almost everyone in the state. Currently, Nevada only offers managed care in Washoe and Clark counties, which are highly urban and include cities like Reno and Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, the state newly budgeted to finance expanding managed care to all counties in the state, which is expected to add about 75,000 individuals to the coverage.\n\nUnitedHealth, Elevance, Centene and Molina are incumbents in the state. UnitedHealth holds about 35% of Nevada\u2019s managed care enrollment, while Elevance, Centene and Molina follow with 34%, 17% and 15% respectively, according to state data.\n\nNevada\u2019s health department said in October that it anticipated awarding four contracts come this year. But in a notice of intent to award released Wednesday, the state said it plans to award contracts to five payers: Centene subsidiary SilverSummit Healthplan; nonprofit health plan CareSource; Molina Healthcare; Elevance subsidiary Community Care Health Plan of Nevada; and Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealth subsidiary.\n\nCentene and CareSource scored the highest, and received contracts for both Clark and Washoe counties along with Nevada\u2019s rural areas. Elevance and Molina were also awarded contracts for Clark and Washoe counties.\n\nUnitedHealth only received an award to serve Clark county. Previously, the insurer had contracts for both Clark and Washoe.\n\nNevada\u2019s notice doesn\u2019t actually award final contracts, but shows those managed care organizations\u2019 proposals were selected for contract negotiations with the state.\n\n\u201cThis result broadly holds serve in NV for the MCOs, with some very modest puts and takes as we expect some enrollment reshuffling as a result of the awards,\u201d JP Morgan analyst John Stansel wrote in a Wednesday note.\n\nInsurers that ink deals with states to administer managed care programs compete aggressively for the contracts, which can be lucrative. However, the current outlook for Medicaid funding is unclear, given the safety-net insurance program \u2014 which, along with its sister program for low-income children, currently covers roughly 80 million Americans \u2014 is on the chopping block for spending cuts as Republicans in Congress look for ways to pay for the president\u2019s tax plan.\n\nConservatives on the Hill have yet to coalesce around a specific blueprint for cuts. But likely strategies include shrinking funding mechanisms that critics say allow states to sidestep their share of Medicaid spending or enacting work requirements for beneficiaries to qualify for Medicaid coverage.\n\nRepublicans are also debating rolling back federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population. Under the Affordable Care Act, states could expand Medicaid coverage to a greater share of their low-income population in return for the federal government assuming a greater share of their medical costs.\n\nIn Nevada, for example, the federal government pays 60% of costs for the traditional Medicaid population, and 90% for the expansion population, according to health policy firm KFF.\n\nTop Republicans have characterized pending cuts as an effort to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse that won\u2019t affect patients. However, if the federal government shrinks its Medicaid spending, states would have increase their own Medicaid spending to pay for the difference \u2014 or reduce benefits or kick people off the program.\n\nIn Nevada specifically, if the federal match rate for the state\u2019s expansion population is stripped, more than 300,000 people could be booted from Medicaid and the state could lose about $670 million in revenue each year, according to health policy firm KFF.\n\nBefore Medicaid expansion, Nevada had one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation.",

            "content": "The litigator\u2019s adage \u201cit\u2019s easy to plead, it\u2019s hard to prove\u201d once again came true in the long-running False Claims Act (FCA) case targeting Medicare Advantage (\u201cMA\u201d) plans operated by UnitedHealth (United). Eight years after the complaint was filed, a Special Master recommended granting United\u2019s motion for summary judgment. U.S. ex rel. Poehling v. UnitedHealth Group, Inc., 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40921 (CD CA). Both the litigation and the Special Master\u2019s report contain valuable insights for all FCA defendants, and especially for those matters involving allegations related to diagnosis coding.\n\nThe government alleged that United violated the FCA\u2019s \u201creverse false claim\u201d provision by failing to return overpayments related to the submission of allegedly invalid diagnosis codes in connection with the MA program. The Special Master recommended summary judgment in United\u2019s favor due to the government\u2019s inability to prove both that United was actually overpaid, and that it improperly avoided an obligation to repay the government. In doing so, the ruling highlights the government\u2019s burden to prove that 1) a diagnosis code is false; and 2) that a defendant \u201cdeceived\u201d the government in \u201cimproperly\u201d withholding an overpayment. It also confirms that materiality is an essential element of a \u201creverse\u201d FCA violation.\n\nLesson #1: The Government Must Prove Its Case\n\nThe Special Master found that the government did not prove the diagnosis codes were unsupported by medical records because the government did not actually review the medical records. Instead, the government identified nearly 28 million diagnosis codes that it argued were invalid, but \u201cdid not compare the diagnosis codes submitted by United\u2019s doctors against the underlying medical records to identify unsupported diagnosis codes.\u201d Rather, \u201cif United\u2019s coders did not identify a diagnosis code during chart review as supported by a medical record, the government assume[d] the diagnosis code was, in fact, not supported.\u201d (Emphasis in original). The Special Master found that assumption woefully insufficient.\n\nThe Special Master also found it compelling that CMS\u2019s own RADV audits \u201cfound support in medical records for diagnosis codes that the government has alleged were unsupported based solely on such codes not having been coded during United\u2019s chart review. These findings undercut the government\u2019s theory that any diagnosis code submitted by United to CMS but not identified by coders in chart review is presumptively invalid.\u201d\n\nThe Special Master further pointed out that \u201cthe government has repeatedly attempted to shift the burden to United to disprove the government\u2019s allegations. Rather than review medical records itself, the government served discovery asking United to identify which of the approximately 28 million diagnosis codes, if any, United contends were supported by medical records and to produce the medical records providing such support.\u201d (Emphases in original). United properly objected to this as \u201c\u2018an improper contention interrogatory that impermissibly seeks to shift the burden of proving an essential element of the government\u2019s False Claims Act case on to UnitedHealth . . .\u2019\u201d but offered to produce the 21 million underlying medical records in order to resolve the discovery dispute. The government rejected that offer, apparently, due to the volume of documents. The Special Master wryly noted that \u201cthe government was responsible for placing that volume of records in dispute.\u201d Defendants should push back on government attempts to force them to prove their innocence, and to take on the government\u2019s own investigatory and evidentiary obligations.\n\nLesson #2: The FCA Is A Fraud Statute\n\nAt base, the False Claims Act is a \u201cfraud statute.\u201d See e.g., United States ex rel. Schutte v. SuperValu, Inc., 598 U.S. 739, 750-51 (2023). As such, the Special Master appropriately focused on the government\u2019s position that \u201cmere avoidance of an obligation to repay money to the government is enough to create liability under the FCA, without the need to prove any deceptive conduct\u201d and found that this position obviates the nature of a fraud statute. The Special Master ruled that \u201cthe impropriety of a defendant\u2019s retention of an overpayment cannot be grounded in the mere fact of the defendant having received the overpayment, or even of being obligated to return it. Otherwise, the requirement of \u2018improper\u2019 conduct would introduce circularity and surplusage into a statute where Congress clearly intended nothing of the kind.\u201d Quite simply, \u201ca reverse FCA claim requires proof that the defendant engaged in conduct that deceived the government about an obligation to repay funds.\u201d\n\nHere, the government did not allege \u201cany sort of deception.\u201d Even if United had retained an overpayment, \u201c[t]he mere retention of overpayments may deprive the government of funds it is owed, but that is not fraud.\u201d While the failure to allege deception was fatal by itself, here there was also evidence that \u201cthe government knew of the very chart review practices of which it now claims United prevented it from learning, and thus the government cannot have been duped into relying on any action or inaction by United in determining whether it had been the victim of overpayments.\u201d\n\nThe bar for both pleading and proving fraud is high. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 9(b). Here, the Special Master correctly recognized that \u201c[i]n relying upon only the \u2018knowing and improper avoidance\u2019 formulation of reverse FCA liability, the government must establish that United knew it had received overpayments and acted in a way that kept the government from learning of the overpayment.\u201d Defendants should hold the government to those requirements. Quite simply, fraud and breach of contract are radically different, and proving fraud is, and should be, hard.\n\nLesson #3: Materiality Matters\n\nIn the eight years since the publication of Universal Health Services v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176 (2016), this blog has written extensively about materiality. More than 1,100 court decisions cite to Escobar. Escobar\u2019s impact is significant and pervasive. Here, the government argued that \u201cmateriality is not a required element of establishing liability under the second prong of the reverse false claim provision.\u201d The Special Master disagreed:\n\nEscobar and subsequent Ninth Circuit cases recognize that, like the FCA as a whole, its reverse false claims provision incorporates the elements of common law fraud (although the provision expands the notion of what constitutes a \u201cfalse claim\u201d under the statute). Accordingly, a materiality element must apply to that provision, regardless of which of its two prongs is the basis for the government\u2019s claim in a given case, because of the inconceivability of fraud absent a materiality element.\n\n(Emphasis added, citations omitted). FCA defendants should continue to hold the government to its burden to prove materiality as well.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the threat of treble damages, per claim penalties, and a variety of administrative remedies (including, but not limited to, suspension and debarment) are intimidating, FCA defendants should take comfort in this decision, which underscores the value of investing in a good defense and litigation strategy. Courts will hold the government\u2019s feet to the fire and require it to meet its burden to prove fraud which, as here, it often simply cannot do.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Health Insurance Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other health insurance stocks.\n\nThe health insurance industry is constantly changing, driven by a movement towards consumer-driven healthcare, in which people actively control their own health and healthcare costs. In that sense, Fortune Business Insights projects that the global healthcare insurance market is estimated to be worth $2.14 trillion in 2024 and will grow from $2.32 trillion in 2025 to roughly $4.45 trillion by 2032, reflecting a 9.7% CAGR over the forecast period.\n\nAI in Health Insurance\n\nAccording to McKinsey, health insurers might benefit significantly from completely incorporating AI and automation into their business operations. The firm believes that for every $10 billion in revenue, insurers could save $150 million to $300 million in administrative costs and $380 million to $970 million in medical expenses. In addition, these technologies may create an additional $260 million to $1.24 billion in income.\n\nThat said, concerns regarding AI's expanding role in health insurance, particularly around claim denials, have escalated in recent months, especially in light of the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. These concerns had previously pushed the Biden administration to establish optional operational agreements with insurers, payers, and providers in 2023. In 2024, an executive order was issued to create criteria and safeguards for AI implementation. However, in January of this year, the Trump administration revoked Biden's AI mandate, proposing that a new action plan be developed by the middle of the year.\n\nCommenting on the rising implementation of AI in health insurance, law firm Maynard Nexsen stated:\n\n\u201cThe AI landscape continues to develop, and the regulations appear to be loosening \u2014 at least at the federal level. These changes have led to uncertainty among organizations using AI technology.\u201d\n\nMedicaid Concerns\n\nMedicaid, the nation's largest health insurance program, which covers more than 70 million people, could be slashed under House Republican proposals. Lawmakers are proposing cutbacks of up to $2.3 trillion over the next decade to help fund border security and extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. As the government works to decrease federal debt while maintaining expenditure commitments, Medicaid remains a key priority. To further expand on the implications of such a move, it should be noted that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has considerably expanded the program's scope and expense, making it the principal provider of comprehensive health and long-term care for one in every five Americans and accounting for approximately $1 out of every $5 spent on healthcare.",

            "content": "AM Best Affirms Credit Ratings of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Its Subsidiaries\n\n03/12/2025 - 04:20 PM\n\nOLDWICK, N.J. --(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of \u201ca\u201d (Excellent) and the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR) of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UnitedHealth Group) ( Minnetonka, MN ) [NYSE: UNH]. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICRs of \u201caa-\u201d (Superior) of the health and dental insurance subsidiaries of UnitedHealth Group, collectively referred to as UnitedHealthcare. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (See link below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.)\n\nThe ratings reflect UnitedHealthcare\u2019s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, very favorable business profile and very strong enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\nThe rating affirmations of UnitedHealthcare reflect sustained balance sheet strength metrics and a very strong operating performance. The group\u2019s risk-adjusted capitalization is at the very strong level, as measured by Best\u2019s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Capital and surplus growth is supported by retained net earnings in excess of dividends to the parent. UnitedHealthcare actively manages subsidiary risk-adjusted capital on a near- to long-term basis to ensure capital levels are supportive of premium growth. Investment risk is on the low side as the vast majority of assets are held in investment grade fixed income securities and cash/short-term investments with no material exposure to equities, real estate or schedule BA assets. The conservative asset allocation drives strong liquidity measures along with favorable operating cash flows supplemented by internal credit agreements.\n\nUnitedHealthcare\u2019s operating performance is assessed as very strong with a consistent trend of premium growth, which was driven by enrollment gains in most lines of business. Over the past year, all business lines reported an increase in premiums except Medicaid. Medicaid premiums moderated approximately 2 percent over the past year as growth from new contracts mostly offsetting membership losses from state redeterminations of eligibility. Net earnings are mostly driven by favorable underwriting results. The group\u2019s investment income remains positive and has shown growth but contributes modestly to overall net earnings. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s operating earnings benefit from its large scale with a membership base of 54 million individuals, providing cost advantages for medical expenditures and administrative expenses. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s strategic focus is on value-based care and reimbursement models to align provider and payor, which aid in managing medical cost trends and improve outcomes for members.\n\nUnitedHealthcare holds substantial market share in all lines of business and on a national basis. Premiums and earnings are well-diversified by business segment and geography. A large membership base of 54 million members provides significant economies of scale. Furthermore, the integration of UnitedHealthcare with its affiliate, Optum, affords UnitedHealthcare a competitive advantage in that it provides access to advanced capabilities for cost management, care delivery, pharmacy and innovative technology, and strong data analytics.\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s ERM program is very mature with a well-established framework and governance. This program is dynamic, being used in daily operations and strategic business planning. Conversely, the large scale of the organization and numerous acquisitions exposes it to material business and reputational risks. Future growth could be challenged by federal and state agencies.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has strong financial flexibility with material non-regulated operating cash flows from its Optum operations. Equity has shown consistent growth over the past five years, driven entirely by retained earnings despite large share repurchases and growing dividend programs. Strong liquidity is driven by favorable operating cash flows, parent company cash, a commercial paper program and a $21 billion revolving credit facility. Financial leverage at year-end 2024 was elevated at 43.7% , as measured by BCAR, and is above the company\u2019s long-term target of 40% . Additionally, earnings before interest and tax coverage remain good but declined in 2024 to about eight times. Furthermore, UnitedHealth Group had a large amount of goodwill and intangibles on the balance sheet totaling approximately 132% of equity. There has been no history of any material impairments and acquired assets continue to contribute favorably to revenues and earnings.\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s operating performance declined materially in 2024, due to $2 billion in direct expenses related to the Change Healthcare cyber breach and $8.3 billion non-cash loss on the sale of its South American business. Core business segments have performed well, although margins on the health business have been under pressure due to medical costs, utilization trends and specialty pharmacy costs. Revenue and earnings growth are expected to return to historical trends in the near term. The company has significant scale and is well-diversified between business segments in its insurance operations, as well as within its non-regulated Optum healthcare service businesses. However, government programs have become a large portion of insurance revenue and earnings.\n\nA complete listing of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries\u2019 FSRs, Long-Term ICRs and Long-Term IRs also is available.\n\nThis press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best\u2019s website.

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group's UNH short percent of float has risen 10.47% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 8.69 million shares sold short, which is 0.95% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.14 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nUnitedHealth Group Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for UnitedHealth Group has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing UnitedHealth Group's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, UnitedHealth Group's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.11%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group deserved some good news. They have had a really challenging year. It started with change healthcare, as amply covered in this newsletter. It continued with a department of justice investigation into insider trading\u2026 or at least, I strongly suspect, given the preservation of records request with which were hit with.\n\nIt continued with the murder of Brian Thompson, a horrifying act in the streets of New York City that, again, is not OK.\n\nA buddhist temple in Kyoto.\n\nHowever, in the past week, we've gotten some really good news for UnitedHealth Group. They deserve congratulations. They beat a department of justice investigation, and as long as legal decisions are the standard of truth in America, which I hope they will continue to be for a variety of reasons for a good long time, today is the day I say good job UnitedHealth Group and I have to assume Justice was served.\n\nI also wanna take a moment to explain why I'm writing an article congratulating United on something, anything. My readers might notice that I criticize united a lot.\n\nFor people who are new to reading this newsletter, here is an example of the many cases in which I'm making fun of or directly criticizing United's business practices:\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, UnitedHealth Group is on team healthcare. Either they're gonna be part of the solution, or they're gonna be part of the problem. I'm trying to convince them to be part of the solution. I do that through some degree of cajoling, but if it's just criticism, it's not really meeting my goals. I want healthcare to be better for patients. I had ideally like healthcare to also be better for doctors, because at the end of the day, I think that's better for patients. I would like patience and doctors to stand together, getting patients better, and making it more tolerable to do so. I think that can probably be aligned with a better business strategy for healthcare payors. But that means they have to join us in that mission. I spent a lot of time thinking about the people who work at United. There are people a lot like me. At one point in time I even applied to work there. I wrote a hit (and humorous) article about it. United doesn't advertise saying \u201chelp us ruin healthcare.\u201d they may be ruining healthcare, practically, but they're not trying to run healthcare. They're trying to run a business. And the people who go work there are generally want to work in healthcare. These are my colleagues. These are my friends. These are people with similar goals in life to me, and too many of the people I know. I don't think the people who work at United healthcare are bad people. I think they're probably pretty good people who wanna make a change and see a huge organization has an opportunity to do that with a lot of support and resources. That's a relatable state of affairs for me. So I feel that my goal, has an author, is to convince United healthcare, and other companies like it, to make better decisions.\n\nAnd, for me, the bottom line is that's more than just criticism. When criticism is due, it should be leveled. But I ceased to become a fair observer of the world when I don't congratulate them when they do things right. In fact, I think it's probably more important to highlight when they do things right than simply to harp on when they do things wrong. I have an opinion about what right is, and an opinion about what wrong is, and as a child psychiatrist, I'm pretty familiar with the fact that behavior is reinforced by attention. And when I pay attention to the good things that United does, and the people at United do, I'm hoping it will influence their behavior so they do more of it.\n\nSo today, here's what happened with the department of justice, here's how united beat the case, and here's what I'd like to see more of from United healthcare and United health group, it's parent organization.\n\nThere is the concept in the law of a qui tam lawsuit. It\u2019s latin, for on behalf of the king.\n\n\u200b\u200bThese are litigation is brought by private citizens on behalf of the government. Usually, it's a case where the whistleblower brings a case for a crime where the government is a victim. So for example, a whistleblower might bring a lawsuit claiming Medicare or Medicaid fraud, or a kickback. One such case here in New York involved in a case against an Addiction Treatment Center (named ACI) with the Attorney General of the State of New York\u2026for accepting kickbacks. Medicare and Medicaid are frequent sources of fraud and abuse. A devious character can just submit claims endlessly, and often get them paid. If what you're doing is criminal and not legal medical care? Well, you can make a lot of money while you're waiting for the government to figure it out and put a stop to your behavior.\n\nIn a qui tam case, a private citizen whistleblower, files a lawsuit on behalf of the government. They're incentivize to do this because if they win, they get to keep a percentage of the money the government would recoup. It's a way to incentivize individuals to blow the whistle on big companies that are defrauding the government.\n\nBack in 2017, a whistleblower inside United Healthcare\u2014now part of the larger UnitedHealth Group\u2014had a lawsuit. They filed against United health group as a qui tam case. This was later taken over by the Department of Justice. Sometimes these cases that the government doesn't leave it to the whistleblower, they bring it inside the DOJ. In this case, the claim was as follows:\n\nThe United States has intervened and filed a complaint in a lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UHG) that alleges UHG obtained inflated risk adjustment payments based on untruthful and inaccurate information about the health status of beneficiaries enrolled in UHG\u2019s largest Medicare Advantage Plan, UHC of California, the Justice Department announced today.\n\nLater in the press release from DOJ, they clarify:\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by James Swoben, a former employee of Senior Care Action Network (SCAN) Health Plan and a consultant to the risk adjustment industry. The lawsuit was filed under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act, which permit private parties to sue on behalf of the United States for false claims for government funds, and to receive a share of any recovery. The False Claims Act permits the government to intervene in such a lawsuit, as it has done, in part, in this case.\n\nIt's really important to remember that when the government brings a lawsuit against you, either civilly or criminally, and they issue these very scary press releases, these are allegations the government is making.\n\nThe government, which can appeal, have not proved them to be true, at least as of this week. The government makes an allegation, and they putting out a press release. That press release serves a purpose\u2014 they can scare up additional witnesses, for example. They need to prove their case, but they haven't done it yet. And even when it comes to a behemoth like UnitedHealth Group, the United States Government is still bigger and slightly scarier. They can put you in jail. United healthcare can't do that. The government has to earn its convictions by actually proving a case in a court of law. In this particular case, in which it was alleged that United defrauded Medicare, they did not make their case in a court of law. Which means, and this is really important, they're not guilty.\n\nNot beyond a reasonable doubt. I am a big fan of the rule of law here in America. If you can't make your case as the government, with all the tremendous resources of the Federal Government behind you, well, then you can just back the F- off. As citizens, we need to respect that the government has an unbelievable amount of fire power behind its ability to bring a prosecution. If they can't make a case, then there's not a case to be made. The tremendous power of the state needs to have limits. One of those limits is this kind of due process. Usually, the government doesn't bring BS cases, but you know what, sometimes it does. Sometimes they bring cases that are not well-founded, and the allegations aren't proven, and we just have to move the pack on and recognize that in this one case, united healthcare didn't do what they were accused of. Frustrating as it can be for people who feel in their heart that a big company has done something wrong, that same due process protects us, in our hour of need, when the government comes after us for reasons dubious. United can hire more lawyers than the average citizen, but everybody deserves to process between them and an angry or vengeful state.\n\nIn this case, a federal Special Master recommended to a judge that the DOJ had not made its case. The allegation was that United had used \u201cup-coding\u201d\u2014creating fictitious diagnoses to increase the rate it was paid for Medicare advantage claims come to the tune of over $2 billion in additional money for diagnoses the patients didn't have. However, this case only included behavior alleged between 2009 and 2016. That was a long time ago:\n\nThe DOJ alleges Medicare paid UnitedHealth Group more than $7.2 billion from 2009 through 2016 based on the company\u2019s efforts to boost revenue by reviewing patient records to find additional diagnoses and adding medical billing codes to their files. According to the DOJ, Medicare would have paid the company $2.1 billion less if it had deleted unsupported billing codes.\n\nSuzanne Sengal is the Special Master appointed to the case. She is not the judge in this matter, but she recommended the judge accept United's motion for dismissal:\n\n\u201cA mere possibility of an overpayment is not enough for the government to carry its burden,\u201d Sagal stated.\n\nBefore we do an unvarnished victory lap for the team at UnitedHealth Group, it's important to point out that they're facing ongoing scrutiny for just this kind of behavior in places that are not California and not in the time period between 2009 and 2016. In fact, there are additional investigations happening right now for other conduct on their part in other places that may meet the level of criminal or civil liability.\n\nIf you're a massive company, such as the biggest healthcare company on earth, you're going to get sued a lot. That's just what's happening. Ideally, you don't do anything wrong, and so none of those lawsuits go anywhere. Less ideally, you've done something that's a problem, and you have to spend a lot of shareholders\u2019 money on lawyers to defend yourselves from the Department of Justice attempting to take your money away, and maybe, just maybe, put you in jail.\n\nWe don't actually have to wonder if the public thinks United healthcare is guilty. The public doesn't even know the difference between UnitedHealth Group and United Healthcare\u2014 but when a senior executive is murdered, they're cheering for the murder all day long. This is disgusting, horrifying, and what's happening. Right now.\n\nSo my advice to UnitedHealth Group\u2014celebrate this one. But, right after that, cooperate with the government to settle any pending cases, and start treating your plan members and many, many patients as well as 10% of all physicians in your employ a little bit better. Start treating healthcare as if it was your baby, because, practically, it kind of is. You need to treat healthcare like it's something that we all need to have intact\u2014 not just now, but in the future. It needs to be more than just profitable in this quarter. It needs to be safe, effective, and even profitable long into the future. That may mean, accepting a little bit less profits now, or spending less of those profits on legal bills, and perhaps spending a little bit more on making sure the care we provide is valuable to the people who need it.\n\nUnited healthcare employs so many people, it boggles the mind. It helps take care of so many patients, it beggars belief. And it would be a better world, for everybody, if United Healthcare and UnitedHealth Group, the parent organization, did a great job of covering care, did a great job of providing care, and if everybody was happy with them, because healthcare was great under their leadership.\n\nWhen the Department of Justice is investigating relentlessly, and citizens are cheering for the murder of your employees, which again, I decry, there's something wrong.\n\nFor today, congratulations on beating an unfounded case! l Let's everyone join United celebrating the fact that they were not convicted or found guilty of fraud, in this one case. We can then encourage them to commit no fraud! We can clap for joy when they take great care of their patient, employees, plan members, and customers, ever onward. Let's celebrate the people at UnitedHealth Group as they try to make things right.\n\nCongratulations, and you've got work to do. We all do, healthcare is complicated, and we need to work together.\n\nShare",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Risk Stocks To Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other low risk stocks.\n\nRisk is a key consideration in investing and portfolio management, as investors generally aim to achieve the maximum return per minimum unit of risk. The true risk of a stock is impossible to measure or quantify, but there are several metrics, such as the volatility of returns or equity beta, that can gauge the magnitude of risk relative to other companies. The equity beta of a stock represents the sensitivity, or correlation, between the returns of the stock and the returns of the broad market. An equity beta below one means that the stock does not respond as much as the broad market to different events, such as macroeconomic developments, monetary policy changes, etc. When a stock with low risk (low beta) is introduced into a portfolio, the overall expected risk of the portfolio is significantly reduced, while the expected return is usually not significantly compromised, leading to a better risk/return profile.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nThere are times when the risk profile of a portfolio becomes a more important consideration than maximizing returns, such as during periods of economic uncertainty, market downturns, or when an investor nears retirement and prioritizes capital preservation over growth. In these situations, investors often shift their focus from aggressive returns, such as growth stocks, to minimizing potential losses, adjusting their portfolios to include more low-beta stocks, bonds, or other defensive assets.\n\nMarket volatility, geopolitical tensions, and changes in monetary policy can also drive investors toward safer investments to protect their capital. Understanding and managing risk, particularly through measures like equity beta, allows investors to navigate uncertain times without exposing themselves to unnecessary losses. While low beta stocks are usually more mature and low growth businesses, they can deliver strong returns during bear markets, as capital actively starts flowing into them and inflates their market valuation. Consequently, by rotating into low risk stocks at the right time, investors can achieve two goals at once \u2013 not only reduce the risk of the portfolio, but also significantly improve the potential return profile.\n\nWe believe the broad stock market is currently at a crossroads and has just entered a new \u201cTrump 2.0 regime,\u201d which will be dominated by unprecedented actions and measures. Not only does the new US administration employ tools such as tariffs that were not used on a large scale for decades, but it has also started some strategic political shifts that could threaten decade-long alliances (such as the US-Europe alliance). All of this, coupled with aggressive cost-cutting in federal budgets and spending, has introduced a lot of uncertainty and difficult-to-digest news for investors.\n\nThe US stock market is also in correction mode since the inauguration date, and there is no certainty about when this will stop. With many surveys showing deteriorating spending and business outlooks, a slowdown in GDP growth with a potential bear market becomes a probable scenario for the following quarters. These are the times when buying low risk stocks could significantly improve the risk profile of one\u2019s portfolio without compromising the potential return. Low risk stocks, as gauged by the equity beta, are usually found in sectors like consumer defensive, healthcare, as well as some financials and energy, which tend to have more predictable and stable business models. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best low risk stocks to buy now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of low risk stocks, we used Finviz to filter the companies that have an equity beta below 1.0x. Then we compared them with Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary Q4 2024 database of hedge funds ownership and included in the article the top 10 names with the highest number of hedge funds that own the stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\n\nEquity Beta: 0.67x\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company operating through two main segments: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health insurance and benefits, and Optum, which offers healthcare services, technology, and pharmacy benefits management.

Optum leverages data analytics, telehealth, and value-based care to improve healthcare delivery and cost efficiency. UNH focuses on expanding digital health solutions, integrating care services, and enhancing affordability while navigating regulatory frameworks.

The company is making significant strides in digital transformation, with UHC mobile app visits up 66% YoY and app registrations increasing nearly 100%.\n\nOn the operational efficiency front, the operating cost ratio of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) improved about 150 basis points over the prior year, driven by business portfolio initiatives and accelerated operating efficiencies. Looking ahead, UNH remains committed to its long-term 13% to 16% growth objective, reflecting both the opportunities and capabilities of the organization. The company expects cash flow from operations to approach $33 billion, or 1.2x net income in 2025, demonstrating strong financial capacity. With strong long-term guidance in place and an equity beta of only 0.67x, UNH is one of the best low risk stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nOverall UNH ranks 2nd on our list of the best low risk stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "UnitedHealthcare\u2019s operating performance is assessed as very strong with a consistent trend of premium growth, which was driven by enrollment gains in most lines of business. Over the past year, all business lines reported an increase in premiums except Medicaid. Medicaid premiums moderated approximately 2 percent over the past year as growth from new contracts mostly offsetting membership losses from state redeterminations of eligibility. Net earnings are mostly driven by favorable underwriting results. The group\u2019s investment income remains positive and has shown growth but contributes modestly to overall net earnings. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s operating earnings benefit from its large scale with a membership base of 54 million individuals, providing cost advantages for medical expenditures and administrative expenses. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s strategic focus is on value-based care and reimbursement models to align provider and payor, which aid in managing medical cost trends and improve outcomes for members.\n\nThe rating affirmations of UnitedHealthcare reflect sustained balance sheet strength metrics and a very strong operating performance. The group\u2019s risk-adjusted capitalization is at the very strong level, as measured by Best\u2019s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Capital and surplus growth is supported by retained net earnings in excess of dividends to the parent. UnitedHealthcare actively manages subsidiary risk-adjusted capital on a near- to long-term basis to ensure capital levels are supportive of premium growth. Investment risk is on the low side as the vast majority of assets are held in investment grade fixed income securities and cash/short-term investments with no material exposure to equities, real estate or schedule BA assets. The conservative asset allocation drives strong liquidity measures along with favorable operating cash flows supplemented by internal credit agreements.\n\nThe ratings reflect UnitedHealthcare\u2019s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its very strong operating performance, very favorable business profile and very strong enterprise risk management (ERM).\n\nOLDWICK, N.J., March 12, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )-- AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of \"a\" (Excellent) and the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR) of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UnitedHealth Group) (Minnetonka, MN) [NYSE: UNH]. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A+ (Superior) and the Long-Term ICRs of \"aa-\" (Superior) of the health and dental insurance subsidiaries of UnitedHealth Group, collectively referred to as UnitedHealthcare. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (See link below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nUnitedHealthcare holds substantial market share in all lines of business and on a national basis. Premiums and earnings are well-diversified by business segment and geography. A large membership base of 54 million members provides significant economies of scale. Furthermore, the integration of UnitedHealthcare with its affiliate, Optum, affords UnitedHealthcare a competitive advantage in that it provides access to advanced capabilities for cost management, care delivery, pharmacy and innovative technology, and strong data analytics.\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s ERM program is very mature with a well-established framework and governance. This program is dynamic, being used in daily operations and strategic business planning. Conversely, the large scale of the organization and numerous acquisitions exposes it to material business and reputational risks. Future growth could be challenged by federal and state agencies.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has strong financial flexibility with material non-regulated operating cash flows from its Optum operations. Equity has shown consistent growth over the past five years, driven entirely by retained earnings despite large share repurchases and growing dividend programs. Strong liquidity is driven by favorable operating cash flows, parent company cash, a commercial paper program and a $21 billion revolving credit facility. Financial leverage at year-end 2024 was elevated at 43.7%, as measured by BCAR, and is above the company\u2019s long-term target of 40%. Additionally, earnings before interest and tax coverage remain good but declined in 2024 to about eight times. Furthermore, UnitedHealth Group had a large amount of goodwill and intangibles on the balance sheet totaling approximately 132% of equity. There has been no history of any material impairments and acquired assets continue to contribute favorably to revenues and earnings.\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s operating performance declined materially in 2024, due to $2 billion in direct expenses related to the Change Healthcare cyber breach and $8.3 billion non-cash loss on the sale of its South American business. Core business segments have performed well, although margins on the health business have been under pressure due to medical costs, utilization trends and specialty pharmacy costs. Revenue and earnings growth are expected to return to historical trends in the near term. The company has significant scale and is well-diversified between business segments in its insurance operations, as well as within its non-regulated Optum healthcare service businesses. However, government programs have become a large portion of insurance revenue and earnings.\n\nA complete listing of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its subsidiaries\u2019 FSRs, Long-Term ICRs and Long-Term IRs also is available.\n\nThis press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best\u2019s website.

            "content": "A court-appointed special master has recommended the dismissal of a 14-year-old whistleblower lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group, citing insufficient evidence to support the claims. The lawsuit, filed by former UnitedHealth finance director Benjamin Poehling in 2011, alleged that the company improperly collected billions of dollars by manipulating risk-adjustment payments in the Medicare Advantage program. Special Master Suzanne Segal found that the government failed to provide evidence to back up its accusations.\n\n\u201cThe government needed to present evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the diagnosis codes United submitted were invalid, i.e., that codes were not supported by the related medical record,\u201d Segal wrote. \u201cThe complete failure of any evidence on this essential element must result in summary judgment for United.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has stated that it objects to Segal\u2019s report and recommendation, which has yet to be adopted by the judge overseeing the case. UnitedHealth Group maintains that its business practices are transparent, lawful, and approved by the federal agency responsible for Medicare.\n\n\u201cAfter more than a decade of DOJ\u2019s wasteful and expensive challenge to our Medicare Advantage business, the special master concluded there was no evidence to support the DOJ\u2019s claims we were overpaid or did anything wrong,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nCourt recommends dismissal of lawsuit\n\nThe original whistleblower complaint named 15 health care companies, but the government narrowed its focus to UnitedHealth Group and WellMed, a Texas-based medical group acquired by UnitedHealth over a decade ago, in 2017.\n\nSegal highlighted that the government\u2019s arguments were speculative and lacked supporting evidence. She noted that the government assumed unsupported doctor diagnosis codes based on company coder reviews, without proving that the codes were erroneous. \u201cUndisputed testimony confirmed that coders may themselves miss diagnosis codes supported by a medical record for any number of reasons,\u201d Segal added.\n\nShe concluded, \u201cThis litigation has been pending for more than a decade, and the government has had ample opportunity to develop evidence in support of its theories. It has not done so.\u201d\n\nThe case represents a significant setback for the government\u2019s efforts to combat alleged overbilling in the Medicare Advantage industry. The ruling is not final, as the Justice Department has the opportunity to appeal the decision.\n\nThe outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications for the future of Medicare Advantage oversight and the government\u2019s ability to pursue similar cases against other health care companies.\n\nPhoto by; David Veksler on Unsplash",

The company has been diagnosing patients in such a way that it triggers extra payments into Medicare Advantage plans \u2013 plans owned and overseen by the insurance giant itself. It works like this: insurers get lump-sum payment from the government to handle their enrollees\u2019 benefits. When patients are diagnosed with certain conditions, payments to their insurers increase.\n\nUnder UnitedHealth\u2019s framework, patients are being price-gouged with every visit to their doctors\u2019 offices. Billions of Medicare records reveal that UnitedHealth-employed doctors boasted large upticks in profitable diagnoses after they joined UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans. UnitedHealth\u2019s Minneapolis branch went so far as to train physicians in the area to report their lucrative diagnoses to the company, including ones that they deemed uncommon. These doctors were also paid bonuses to suggest conditions to patients that garnered large insurance payments, showing without a doubt that Big Healthcare has little concern for the patients it claims to serve.\n\nPrice gouging vulnerable patients doesn\u2019t stop with UnitedHealth. Our federal government has spent $1.45 trillion in taxpayer money on Medicaid and Medicare alone in 2023 \u2013 double the Pentagon\u2019s budget. After the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the cost of private health insurance skyrocketed for the average American, more than doubling between 2013 and 2019.\n\nBy circumventing federal mandates, the U.S. hospital system too is making the cost of basic care even more unbearable for patients, especially the infirm and those already struggling to make ends meet. Nearly 80 percent of American hospitals refuse to comply with commonsense rules requiring them to post the cost of care online for all patients to see well in advance of receiving treatment. By not clearly displaying prices upfront, hospitals and other health companies are able to charge whatever they want, causing many patients and employees to delay necessary medical treatment out of fear of unknown costs or else pay steep prices due to these hospitals\u2019 shameful misconduct.\n\nIt should be no surprise that 92 percent of people say they support efforts by the federal government to require hospitals and health insurance companies to provide the actual cost of treatments rather than just estimates.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order to restore healthcare price transparency comes not a moment too soon. It aims to make \u201cmeaningful price information available to patients to support a more competitive, innovative, affordable, and higher quality healthcare system\u201d by ensuring hospitals comply with the law. Going forward, it\u2019s the administration\u2019s order that \u201cmachine-readable file with negotiated rates for every single service the hospital provides\u201d be available to all those who are tired of healthcare sticker shock.\n\nWe at Solidarity HealthShare are hopeful that the Trump administration will continue to revamp the healthcare sector with transparency and accountability, and we are already taking steps to work alongside the Department of Government Efficiency and Health and Human Services on this important issue. The era of fraud and abuse from our health providers must end. And ethical, affordable care must soon become the standard of care for all patients.\n\nChris Faddis is president of Solidarity HealthShare , a health care sharing ministry guided by the moral teachings of the Catholic Church that negotiates directly with providers to ensure delivery of high-quality and affordable, life-affirming health care for the more than 46,000 members it has served since 2016.",

Griffin was an early adopter of quantitative, technology-driven investment strategies, implementing sophisticated methods long before many firms had even integrated basic digital tools. His reliance on cutting-edge technology and data-driven decision-making positioned Citadel as a leader in the hedge fund industry, setting it apart from traditional investment firms. As of Q4 2024, it holds approximately $577.87 billion in 13F securities in its highly diversified portfolio.\n\nKnown more commonly as Ken Griffin, Kenneth Cordele Griffin was born in 1968. His interest in finance began early, and while still a student, he started investing from his Harvard dorm room. In 1986, he launched a small hedge fund that leveraged emerging quantitative analytics to guide investment decisions. A year after he earned a Bachelor of Arts with Honors in Economics from Harvard College in 1989, Griffin founded Citadel, which has since become one of the world\u2019s most successful alternative investment firms. In addition to leading Citadel, Griffin serves as the Founder and Non-Executive Chairman of Citadel Securities, a major global market maker.\n\nCitadel was built on the principle that exceptional talent, combined with advanced quantitative analytics and powerful technology, could unlock significant opportunities in capital markets. The firm\u2019s culture emphasizes continuous learning, innovation, and meritocracy, earning it a reputation as one of the best places to work on Wall Street. Today, Citadel manages over $60 billion in investment capital, consistently ranking among the most profitable hedge funds worldwide. Its success has benefited a range of institutional investors, including pension funds, university endowments, hospital systems, and foundations, contributing to impactful advancements in fields such as medical research and scientific discovery.\n\nCitadel Investment Group employs a diverse range of investment strategies, with a strong focus on fixed income, macro, and quantitative trading. Its fixed income and macro strategy, one of the firm\u2019s longest-running approaches, targets interest rate swaps, sovereign bonds, inflation, currencies, emerging markets, equities, commodities, and credit. By leveraging macro and relative value strategies, the firm integrates quantitative modeling, deep macroeconomic insights, and monetary policy expertise to identify opportunities. The research and trading teams work collaboratively, applying both qualitative and quantitative analysis to generate and refine investment ideas.\n\nAdditionally, Citadel\u2019s Global Quantitative Strategies (GQS), established in 2012, has rapidly grown into a major force in the industry. Utilizing advanced statistical and quantitative modeling techniques, its agile teams of researchers, engineers, and traders develop and execute investment strategies with precision. Specialization, collaboration, and centralized operations drive efficiency, allowing the firm to run complex strategies at scale. By combining cutting-edge technology with deep expertise, Citadel continues to expand its capabilities and strengthen its competitive position in global markets.\n\nBeyond finance, Griffin has made a profound impact through philanthropy, donating over $2 billion to education, healthcare, and social initiatives. His philanthropic efforts, now coordinated through Griffin Catalyst, have expanded educational access, strengthened medical and research institutions, and supported cultural organizations. His strategic insights also played a key role in the development of Operation Warp Speed, accelerating COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Whether in business or philanthropy, Griffin\u2019s commitment to data-driven decision-making and transformative impact remains a defining characteristic of his career.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe stocks discussed below were picked from Citadel Investment Group\u2019s Q4 2024 13F filings. They are compiled in the ascending order of the hedge fund\u2019s stake in them as of December 31, 2024. To assist readers with more context, we have included the hedge fund sentiment regarding each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 150\n\nCitadel Investment Group\u2019s Equity Stake: $799.47 Million\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported quarterly revenue of $100.81 billion in Q4 2024, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations of $101.76 billion. The company\u2019s medical cost ratio rose to 85.5%, surpassing the estimated 84.96%, reflecting increased demand for healthcare services under Medicare plans. As a result, UnitedHealth\u2019s stock dropped nearly 5% in premarket trading. Despite these challenges, its Optum healthcare services unit expanded by 9% to $65.1 billion, and the company delivered earnings per share of $6.81, exceeding estimates. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reaffirmed its 2025 profit outlook, forecasting full-year revenue between $450 billion and $455 billion, signaling confidence in its long-term growth strategy.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock has struggled, declining 25.7% from its November 2024 peak of $630.73 and underperforming the broader healthcare sector. Over the past three months, shares have dropped nearly 23%, remaining below key technical indicators such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. However, analysts continue to express optimism, maintaining a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating with an average price target of $639.21, suggesting a 36.4% upside from current levels. Despite recent setbacks, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\u2019s continued growth in Optum and strong full-year revenue guidance highlight its long-term potential, making the stock an appealing opportunity at its current valuation.\n\nBuilding on UnitedHealth\u2019s long-term growth potential, the company received a significant legal boost on March 4, 2025, when a court-appointed special master found no evidence supporting the U.S. government\u2019s billion-dollar fraud claims against it. Special Master Suzanne Segal determined that discrepancies between diagnoses submitted by doctors and later assessments by UnitedHealth\u2019s coders did not constitute fraud, undermining the Justice Department\u2019s 2016 lawsuit. While the ruling is not final, if adopted by the presiding judge, it would dismiss the case entirely, removing a major legal overhang for the company. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) welcomed the findings, criticizing the decade-long legal battle as wasteful and unfounded. This development strengthens UnitedHealth\u2019s position, reaffirming investor confidence and alleviating regulatory concerns. With its strong revenue outlook, expanding Optum unit, and now reduced legal risks, UNH remains a top stock to buy, particularly given its current undervaluation and analysts\u2019 bullish price targets.\n\nOverall UNH ranks 5th on our list of the top stocks to buy according to Citadel Investment Group. While we acknowledge the potential for UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "by Les Luchter , January 16, 2025\n\nImage: Prescription drugs by Nick YoungsonCC BY-SA 3.0Pix4free\n\n\u201cDrug companies themselves,\u201d not pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like UnitedHealth Group\u2019s (UHG) Optum brand, are responsible for high drug prices in the U.S., declared UHG CEO Andrew Witty as the beleaguered company released its full-year 2024 earnings results.\n\nSpeaking to the analyst community for the first time since UHG cancelled its annual investor conference last month after the high-profile murder of Brian Thompson, CEO of its UnitedHealthCare insurance brand, Witty kicked off Thursday morning\u2019s earnings call with an impassioned 10-minute overview of UHG\u2019s mission: \u201cto continue improving quality and health outcomes for individuals and their families, while lowering costs for everyone.\u201d\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nAnd he began that overview by expressing gratitude \u201dfor the overwhelming expressions of condolence and support following the murder of our friend Brian Thompson\u2026.He devoted his time to helping make the health system work better for all of the people we're privileged to serve. He would dive in with passion and caring to find solutions to improve experiences, whether for an individual consumer, an employer, or a public health agency. \u201c\n\nWitty\u2019s remarks came as USA Today released results of a Suffolk University poll showing two-thirds of Americans think Thompson\u2019s suspected killer should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Most of the other third agreed the murder was wrong, but said \u201cthey understood the anger the alleged shooter felt toward America's health care system.\u201d\n\nA lot of that anger lately has been coming not only against the insurance side of the business, but against the PBMs, of which Optum is one of the three leading players. PBMs serve as the price-setting intermediary between health insurance companies and pharmacies\n\nYet, Witty said during the conference call, \u201cthe PBMs are really the only effective mechanism across the system which holds the pharmaceutical company to account once it chooses to set its price and\u2026 to inflate that price every single year.\n\n\u201cThe PDM is there to\u2026 negotiate on behalf of employers, unions, states and others to try and bring down those prices.\"\n\nNoting that Americans pay disproportionally more for drugs than people in other countries, Witty gave as an example a GLP-1 medication that \u201ccosts $900 in the U.S.,\u201d but \u201cabout a tenth of that in Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOptumRx alone delivers many tens of billions of dollars in savings annually versus the pricing set by the manufacturers, including on the GLP-1s,\u201d Witty said. \u201cThat sharply reduces the gap versus other countries. But even then, prices in the U.S. are still multiples of what the rest of the world is. the world pays for the same drugs.\n\n\u201cPharmacy benefit managers play a vital role in holding those prices down,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhich is why drug companies and their allies have spent the past several years attacking them.\n\nOptum, Witty said, passes on \u201cmore than 98% of the rebate discounts we negotiate with drug companies to our clients,\u201d but the 2% of its clients who refuse to pass on the rebates \u201cis enough to give people the excuse to argue that the system is not working properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're taking that excuse of who\u2019s really setting the price off the table today,\u201d he declared, announcing that Optum is now \u201ccommitted to fully phasing out those remaining arrangements so that 100% of rebates that we negotiate will go to customers by 2028 at the latest.\u201d\n\nOverall, Witty said, health care costs more in the U.S. because \u201cthere are participants in the system who benefit\u201d from higher prices not only for prescriptions, but for medical procedures and doctor visits. \u201cLower cost equivalent quality sites of service, for example, can be good for consumers\u2026but threaten revenue streams for organizations that depend on charging more for care. \u201c\n\nCritics might say UnitedHealth Group is one of those organizations \"charging more for care.\" On the earnings side, UnitedHealth Group reported revenues of $400.3 billion in 2024, an 8% increase over 2023. Guidance for 2025 puts revenues at $450 billion to $455 billion.",

            "content": "\"Most of us know who the founders of the world's largest companies are - Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Walmart. But does anyone know anything about the founder of the insurance and healthcare company UnitedHealth, which is just as big? Does anyone know anything about Burke? If so, we'd love it if you can tell us,\" begins a video on the popular YouTube channel AHealthcareZ, and it wasn't a rhetorical question. Over the 50 years since UnitedHealth was founded, Richard T. Burke (81) has given few interviews.\n\nNow he has given an exclusive interview to \"Globes\", during what is perhaps the most turbulent period in the history of America's biggest health insurer. In early December, the CEO of the group's insurance company UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was murdered. A murder is of course shocking and to be condemned, and yet the crime sparked very unusual reactions in the US. Some saw it as an opportunity to let off steam that had been building up against UnitedHealth. They responded to obituaries on Facebook and LinkedIn with laughing icons, printed products with the killer's picture, and even wrote songs in his honor. Folk singer Jesse Wells wrote a song in which he called Burke \"the Warren Buffett of health, the Jeff Bezos of fear.\"\n\nIn addition to the murder and the cesspool of negative public opinion, UnitedHealth is facing more concrete problems. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported two weeks ago that the US Department of Justice is investigating the company on suspicion of overcharging government insurance. Although this lawsuit was dismissed in court last Wednesday, and UnitedHealth has accused the WSJ of spreading false information, it is only one of several lawsuits and investigations underway against it.\n\nAs a result, the company's share price has fallen about 20%, wiping almost $35 billion off its market cap since the murder. But even after these declines, United is still a giant company: the 18th biggest in the US in terms of market cap and the eighth biggest in terms of revenue. According to estimates by the WSJ, 5% of US GDP passes through it every day, and it employs 90,000 doctors, 10% of US doctors.\n\nBurke holds no official position at UnitedHealth today, but he is still a shareholder, and is considered the man who built its business model and organizational culture. He founded the company in 1977, first stepped down from his main roles in 1987 but remained a director. In 2006, he was called to the helm after CEO and chairman William McGuire resigned following suspicions of securities violations. Burke returned to being the company's chairman until 2017 and served as a director until 2022. Although he is careful to note that \"all opinions I express in the article are my own\" and that he does not officially represent the company, he still refers to it as \"we.\"\n\n\"Everything they say about us is character assassination,\" he tells \"Globes.\" \"The system is flawed, even broken, but our part of it is not flawed.\"\n\nAnd after you saw the public reaction to the murder, have you learned any lessons, except to beef up security?\n\n\"What lessons should we learn? It was simply the murder of a great young man by a disgusting person (Luigi Mangione), not even a customer who had a bad experience with us.\" He is conducting the interview both on the occasion of his joining as chairman and business advisor to Korro AI, an Israeli startup led by Mati Kochavi, and also because he is a supporter of Israel. \"I start every morning by reading all the Israeli press, because you are a fascinating country. Your resilience is unbelievable.\"\n\n\"Integration is not a monopoly\"\n\nUnitedHealth has never been just an insurance company. It also owns many of the clinics and healthcare networks that provide medical care to its policyholders, as well as assisted living, mental health services, and more. Over the past 15 years, it has been aggressively buying up such services.\n\nIt also owns several companies that serve as influential intermediaries in the insurance sector: companies that tailor the insurance plans they offer to their employees for employers; companies that handle and negotiate with drug companies on the prices they will charge insurance companies; a company that arbitrates in disagreements between insurance companies and doctors; and a company whose job is to set what is fair and acceptable payment for certain medical services for the entire market.\n\nHow is it possible that UnitedHealth owns all of these companies? \"Conflicts of interest are the business model,\" wrote reporter Sara Sirota in \"The American Prospect\" magazine in 2023. \"It is so complicated that 25% of its revenue comes from subsidiaries.\" Some of these conflicts of interest have even resulted in lawsuits or government investigations. Burke, predictably, sees it differently. \"Size is not a bad thing. Integration is not a monopoly. There are still a lot of companies competing with us, and any insured person or employer can choose to work with a different insurance company, and any doctor can choose to work with or against a different insurance company.\"\n\nBut ultimately, the patient doesn\u2019t exactly decide which plan to get. There are a lot of middlemen, some even owned by UnitedHealth, which influence the decision.\n\n\"The employers or government insurers choose the insurance package, and it\u2019s in their best interest to choose for the patient. They may do a poor job sometimes, but I don\u2019t think an employer or government company would intentionally make a decision for the patient that\u2019s not in their best interest. I find it hard to see that happening.\"\n\nA dive into UnitedHealth's model could shed light on why Americans feel their healthcare system is so broken.\n\nIt all began in 1973 when Burke saw an opportunity in the form of the HMO Law. Until then, doctors and hospitals in the US had been charging for use, and prices had gradually started to rise for both insurers and patients. The then US President Richard Nixon, decided to solve the problem: the insurance company would contract with certain doctors, pay them a fixed amount, and the more expensive treatments they performed, the less they would have left for their salary. These organizations were supposed to be non-profit institutions, something like the Israeli health insurance fund model.\n\nBurke was one of the members of the think tank that developed the concept, but what he founded and eventually became UnitedHealth was not a nonprofit, but a commercial company to manage these nonprofits. \"This model almost allowed us not to lose,\" he admits. \"We were very lucky. The HMO law guaranteed us demand, and it was enacted in such a way that it overrode all local state laws. I think this is a rare example of a federal official doing something useful.\"\n\nHow did you become the biggest?\n\n\"We signed agreements or directly employed the largest number of doctors. That way, our clients had a wide choice of doctors. The existing clients of these doctors wanted to be insured with us so as not to change doctors. That was an important factor in our success.\"\n\nThe company that has it all\n\nThe critics claim that at this point UnitedHealth began to put pressure on doctors to reduce costs as much as possible. \"The aim of the law was to cut costs,\" Burke says without apology. \"The system was then without a ceiling. Doctors or pharmaceutical companies could charge whatever they wanted. So we came into the picture, and although we maintained quality, we also controlled the price.\"\n\nAnd over time, you weakened more and more factors in the health market.\n\n\"We became more sophisticated over time. Today, we directly or indirectly employ about 90,000 doctors and we have the ability to control the entire cycle.\"\n\nThis integration is at the heart of criticism of the company, which operates wearing several hats. First of all, it is a classic insurance company. In this role, there is an allegation that it rejects or delays payments and wears down patients with bureaucracy. Burke says: \"That's not true at all. We approve the vast majority of claims we receive immediately, and the rest can be appealed. We approve more claims than rival companies. Bureaucratic exhaustion is definitely not part of our business model.\"\n\nUnitedHealth said, \"We ultimately pay 98% of claims by our customers when they are filed on time and include complete information. For the 2% of claims that are not approved, most are cases where the services are not included in the criteria set by the payer, such as the employer or Medicare and Medicaid. Only 0.5% of claims are not approved due to clinical information or patient safety.\"\n\nBut these allegations have been specifically directed at UnitedHealth for many years, and recently escalated when two families of its deceased customers sued it, alleging that it uses an AI system to process insurance claims, even though it knows that the system makes many mistakes and wrongly denies claims. UnitedHealth argued in response that patients did not exhaust the appeals process. \"The naviHealth predict tool is not used to make coverage determinations. The tool is used as a guide to help us inform providers, families and other caregivers about what sort of assistance and care the patient may need both in the facility and after returning home. Coverage decisions are based on CMS coverage criteria and the terms of the member\u2019s plan. This lawsuit has no merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,\" UnitedHealth responded to a question from \"Globes.\"\n\nThe second type of claim relates to cases in which UnitedHealth is actually the healthcare provider for the government insurance company. The US provides government insurance for those aged 65 and over and people who cannot afford private insurance, but actually provides the service through clinics that it does not own. The claim is that when the government is the pocketbook and UnitedHealth is the service provider, it inflates costs.\n\nAccording to a series of articles by \"STAT\", UnitedHealth held \"coding workshops\" to teach doctors at clinics it acquired how to report illnesses under the \"correct,\" more expensive, code. Doctors argued that in extreme cases, the more expensive code also required patients to undergo unnecessary testing. They said they were not explicitly told to code one way or the other, but the implication was very strong.\n\nBurke says, \"Doctors have to make livelihoods, but I don\u2019t believe they made decisions against patients. This is another character assassination against us. You won\u2019t hear them openly say that\u2019s the case, not because they\u2019re afraid of us, but because it\u2019s not true.\"\n\nUnitedHealth said: \"Our providers and partners make independent clinical decisions and we expect them to diagnose based on medical standards and document the information fully. We provide training and documentation support because the medical outcome is better, and regulators audit our documentation regularly.\"\n\nOther practices are even more complex. For example, UnitedHealth owns pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies, whose official role is to negotiate with drug companies on behalf of insurance companies. Today, they are the punching bag of the US health system, and no one understands why they are needed.\n\nPBMs operate on a kickback system. The drug company supposedly charges a list price, but reimburses part of the cost to the insurance company. There are several problems with this system. There is no transparency about the real price of the drugs, it is not always known how the reimbursement is divided between the insurance companies and the PBM, and the PBM may allegedly prefer a drug that yields a more generous profit over the one with the best results (and, unlike the insurance company, it does not even have an interest in the patient staying healthy).\n\nUnitedHealth said, \"PBM companies constitute a major counterweight to the monopolistic power of drug companies, which would otherwise set and raise drug prices without limit.\"\n\nWe don't make the laws\n\nThese kinds of claims are made to a large extent against all US insurance companies, but UnitedHealth is considered expert in exploiting the interrelationships between its various parts. For example, it has a bank that offers high-interest loans to its doctors who are its service providers. If UnitedHealth delays paying them what they are owed (by denying patients\u2019 claims), they are more likely to take out loans.\n\nThe claim, which is perhaps the most serious ever made against UnitedHealth, was made as part of a lawsuit by a male nurse named Maxwell Ollivant. He later withdrew the lawsuit on his own initiative. The lawsuit alleged that the company pressured nursing staff to encourage patients to forgo end-of-life care through \"critical illness conversations\" with patients who had \"aggressive aims for their final days.\"\n\nThis lawsuit suggests that the company tends to examine the condition and profitability of each patient individually. Burke notes that this is indeed possible in UnitedHealth's computer systems. \"If you go into our control room, you can see every patient in the system,\" Burke says, \"and we use AI a lot to make decisions. AI helps us improve our medical records and make care better.\"\n\nBefore implementation of Obamacare, which expanded government insurance to groups of people who were not insured at all, UnitedHealth bought the company that had won the contract to build the website that presents the program\u2019s insurees with their options, which may have allowed it to present itself in a positive way there. Burke sees things differently: \"The computer systems they tried to implement didn\u2019t work, and even though we didn\u2019t like Obamacare at all at first, we got involved and made things work.\"\n\nYet, at the beginning of that period, UnitedHealth bled money and its stock fell. \"But what can we do?\" says Burke. \"We don't set the rules. The pricing didn't make sense, and in the end we decided we weren't participating in it. Only when the reimbursement levels rose to a level we felt comfortable with did we return to participate in this program.\"\n\nThe US pays the most in the world for healthcare by a wide margin, but it is not the healthiest nation, and patients hate the healthcare system. Do you agree that there is a problem with it?\n\n\"Sure. But the problem is not with us. Our customers are very happy with us. Not all of them, but not everyone who buys at Costco comes out happy either. What is really broken in the system is the government's part.\"\n\nIn what sense?\n\n\"The government pays low rates, and then everyone else in the chain has to pay more. In this situation, we try to provide the most effective and high-quality products.\"\n\nDo you expect the new administration to change anything in the healthcare system?\n\n\"We don't know what its plans are time. It probably won't repeal Obamacare, because people are already insured there and you can't get them out. You can lower the prices of prescription drugs. Drug prices in the US are the highest in the world, by a wide margin. The US subsidizes the use of drugs for the whole world. Maybe he'll deal with drug prices.\"\n\nDo you think Trump is doing the right thing with his government cuts?\n\n\"He won't throw the baby out with the bathwater. The US government is shredding money. It's good to have outsiders come in, who have no interest or connection to the government, and cut some. Trump's appointments were controversial, but he deserves to have loyal people working for him. That's the right of an administrator.\"\n\nWhat do you think of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is considered a conspiracy theorist who doesn't believe in science and medicine?\n\n\"Trump is hiring people who do things differently, people who rock the boat a little. Kennedy understands health. He's said some radical things in the past, but he's backed away from some of them.\"\n\nFor example, about the link that has been debunked over and over again between vaccines and autism?\n\n\"That link needs to be examined.\"\n\nAn Israel lover who discovered he's Jewish\n\nBurke has given almost no interviews in recent years. The last profile articles published about him were related to his acquisition of the then Canadian hockey team, the Winnipeg Jets. That was in 1995. One personal said, \"His fans say he's a classic entrepreneur, while his critics say he's a crude dictator. Another said, \"Burke is an aggressive businessman who won't let up.\"\n\nThis aggressiveness doesn't really come through during the current interview, even though the things he says are sometimes harsh. This duality is perhaps the secret to his success. \"I've never seen an obstacle as the end of the road, but as a station to be passed. That's been the secret to success for me, but not always. There were times when I probably should have given up, but I didn't.\"\n\nBurke says that he grew up in a modest home in a small town in Georgia. \"I was lucky enough to study with the same group of friends from kindergarten to the end of high school. After that, I went to university in Atlanta and then in Virginia.\" In Georgia, he worked as an analyst at a company called Interstudy, then founded UnitedHealth under the name Charter Med.\n\nHe has been married three times. \"I have six children today, and my greatest pride is that they are pleasant, happy people. I was very involved in their upbringing. I always thought they should decide who they were, but I had expectations for them and I am very happy with what has emerged.\" Three of his children are active on Wall Street, one daughter has a degree in clinical psychology, another son built his own business and sold it to return to manage the family fortune, and one daughter is studying nursing.\n\nHis father's family were Irish and British who lived in Texas for many generations. His mother is of German descent and was raised as a Lutheran, but about a decade ago an interesting detail was discovered about her. \"A few years ago I started playing with the Roots software,\" says Burke, \"and I realized that my grandmother was Jewish, which means my mother and I are Jewish too. When I told her about it, she was very surprised.\"\n\nHe has an unusual interest in Israel, and not because he is Jewish. Even before he discovered this, he thought Israel was a very intriguing place and used to visit it a lot. That's when he also met Mati Kochavi. \"Before Covid, I met through a friend several Israeli startups that wanted to work with the American healthcare system. At the meeting, I got the impression that the companies had failed significantly to understand the system, and the differences between it and the Israeli healthcare system.\n\n\"But after two years, I brought a manager from United's investment fund to Israel, and we had a meeting like this with 10-12 other companies, and the difference was dramatic. They had learned the material, and now understood the health system much better. And in the end, the fund invested in seven of the companies.\"\n\nBurke plans to come back to visit Israel, \"When it's safe to do so. You need to close this war so you don't have to do it again.\"\n\nWhat do you think of Trump's plans in this regard?\n\n\"I'm optimistic. Biden didn't bring security to the world. Trump will deal with the problems in Israel and Ukraine. He understands negotiations. Sometimes in negotiations you have to scare people with alternatives that they don't like.\"\n\nAre you considering investing in other Israeli companies?\n\n\"I don't invest that much myself anymore. My son manages the investments for me. I haven't retired from life yet, but I have from that part of it.\"\n\nThe Israeli startup headed by Burke\n\nMati Kochavi, founder of Korro AI, and Richard Burke met through a political friend. \"When I called Richard, I felt that the conversation was of no consequence for him,\" Kochavi tells Globes, \"But he invited me to a meeting at his house. I brought him a bottle of high-quality whiskey and other things that are not covered by health insurance. In the end, it turned out that he invited me to stay overnight so that he could show the presentation to his wife the next day.\n\n\"In the morning, I gave the presentation in the kitchen and I saw that she was enthusiastic. She said: If there had been a product like this when our children were little, I would have told you to invest everything in it and not in United.\" Burke now serves as Korro AI's chairman and business advisor.\n\nKochavi is an entrepreneur and businessman who previously operated through homeland security company Logic, which did extensive business in the UAE long before the peace agreements with Israel. He is one of the owners of tech company AGT, the Moonscape Ventures fund, and in recent years his name has been associated mainly with the media sector. He is perhaps best known to the public for the \"Eva's Story\" project, which made the story of the Holocaust accessible to young people.\n\nKorro AI was founded three and a half years ago, and is focused on child development, mental health, and preventive medicine. The company has developed a series of educational games to train children's physical and mental development challenges in various fields. The system is based on AI to analyze movements, facial and body expressions and build a treatment plan.\n\n\"I love children,\" says Kochavi. \"I stop loving people after the age of 17, and there is nothing that breaks my heart more than a child whose opportunity has been taken away. Children and teenagers have been dramatically affected by what the world has been going through in recent years. One in four suffer from developmental or mental health problem. But there are not enough therapists.\"\n\nIn Israel, the Maccabi Health Fund uses technology. Kochavi says, \"In the US, the product is everywhere, from the wealthy clinics in Manhattan to the most distant regions. Therapists can treat 50-100 children at the same time, while spending 45 minutes in a room with the child who needs it most.\"\n\nKochavi says that Burke is very involved in society, on a day-to-day basis. \"Mental health is the area where both Israel and the US need the most help,\" says Burke. \"Ending the war is actually only ending half of the fight against it. Rehabilitation afterwards is a war in itself - hostages, soldiers, evacuees, you have to be prepared to treat them, and that won't be easy at all. I think technology could help a lot. It doesn't replace human therapists, but sometimes it's instead of nothing.\"\n\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on March 10, 2025.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2025.",

            "content": "A pizza order, a thank you, or a death threat \u2014 Giuseppe Mantova didn\u2019t know which awaited him as he answered the call the Wednesday evening before Christmas. The phone at Vito\u2019s Pizza had been ringing more than usual that week, thanks to an illustration Mantova\u2019s 30-year-old daughter had taped above the cash register of Luigi Mangione as a saint, wearing an emerald-green robe with a sun haloed behind his dark hair.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supporting a criminal,\u201d a woman on the other end of the line told Mantova. \u201cI\u2019m not coming to your place anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, don\u2019t come!\u201d the 64-year-old replied in his heavy Italian accent, and hung up.\n\nVito\u2019s sits in a strip mall in Towson, Maryland, the hometown of Mangione, who\u2019d been arrested weeks earlier in connection with the early-morning murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a New York City street. News of the crime rocked the Baltimore suburb where Mangione grew up, back when Mantova knew him as just another teenager who came in after school to order a chicken-parm slice.\n\nMantova\u2019s daughter tells me she taped up the illustration as a statement against the \u201ccorrupt health care system in America.\u201d After a customer posted a photo of the St. Luigi display on social media and it went viral, Mantova and his employees were bombarded with calls. Some echoed the woman\u2019s sentiments, accusing Mantova of supporting murder. One man called with a death threat.\n\nBut along with the angry calls and Facebook messages, Vito\u2019s has been praised and thanked for hanging the illustration. Some callers want to talk about their negative experiences with health-insurance claims and denials. Some say they know Mangione personally; a supposed family friend from California and a college classmate from Chicago both called, wanting to pay for pizzas that Mantova could hand out to people in the restaurant for free. (Mantova turned them down but thanked them for the offer.)\n\nIn January, I visit the bustling shop, decorated with large photographs of the Italian coastline on the race-car-red walls and lined with squeaky, beige pleather booths. Italian music blares from the speakers. St. Luigi is no longer looking over the restaurant \u2014 the owner of the strip mall asked Mantova to take down the printout because of too many complaints. As Mantova throws a slice with pepperoni into the oven, I ask why the restaurant had kept it up for so long in spite of the stir.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cInsurance is very expensive; they charge too much,\u201d Mantova says in Italian. He tells me about his own negative experiences with his insurance company, especially while trying to get an MRI covered. So, he was happy to post it.\n\nThe national conversation about Mangione has made its way to him as he sits in Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center, where he receives about five to 10 letters a day. In his only statement since his arrest, released through his attorneys in February, he wrote: \u201cI am overwhelmed by \u2014 and grateful for \u2014 everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe. While it is impossible for me to reply to most letters, please know that I read every one that I receive.\u201d\n\nThe Crime\n\nThe first look at the killer came from grainy security footage \u2014 a person dressed in all black with a gray backpack, gun aimed squarely at Thompson\u2019s back in the predawn light of Dec. 4. Another photo of the suspect showed them at Starbucks, black mask pulled tightly over their nose and mouth. The next day, there was an image released of a young person caught on a hostel\u2019s security camera with a hood over their head, flashing a big smile at someone beyond the photo\u2019s frame. Then came a photo of the suspect in the back of a cab with a blue medical mask, hood up, thick eyebrows framing dark eyes. Related Content\n\nThe crime was shocking \u2014 as were the reverberations that spread across the country afterward.\n\nThe bullet casings had the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny,\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d written on them, echoing a common phrase used by critics of the insurance industry to describe its claims-handling practices. This wasn\u2019t a random victim \u2014 the bullets seemed to indicate that Thompson was targeted because of his work. And as a nationwide manhunt began, the conversation was not about murder in plain sight or vigilantism, but Americans\u2019 frustrations with their health care. People spoke out about how only the wealthy in America can access proper care, about family members who\u2019d gone through grueling medical procedures only to be buried in debt, about loved ones who\u2019d died of cancer and other fatal diseases after their insurance denied coverage for treatment.\n\n\u201cThis support has transcended political, racial, and even class divides,\u201d reads Mangione\u2019s only public statement.\n\nFinally, on Dec. 9, a name was released. The primary suspect was Mangione. The details made public about the 26-year-old only exacerbated the frenzy around the crime. This was not a person living on the fringes of society, as we normally think about those suspected of political violence \u2014 Mangione was from a respected, wealthy family, someone who went to elite schools and was generally well-liked.\n\nSo, what happened? What could have caused this young man with seemingly every opportunity in the world to be accused of something so extreme? Like the customers in that Maryland pizza parlor, the public has grafted their own experiences, biases, and political views onto the scraps of Mangione\u2019s background that have been reported so far. He became a sort of twisted Rorschach test: It was his chronic pain, it was his schooling, it was his politics. But who is Luigi Mangione, really? And how did he become the most debated and polarizing murder suspect in recent history?\n\nGrowing Up Mangione\n\nA few miles away from Vito\u2019s Pizza, Mangione grew up as the youngest of three in a large four-bedroom brick home on a quiet cul-de-sac in Towson. He lived with two older sisters, MariaSanta and Lucia, and his parents, Louis and Kathleen, and often got together with his dozens of cousins. Even when playing as a kid, Mangione was analytical and science-oriented. Once, he and a group of friends drew pictures of their dream homes. While everyone else sketched large, intricate mansions with swimming pools and multicar garages, Mangione\u2019s was different: a small, square box with four identically-sized rooms. \u201cIt was everything I needed. Nothing more, nothing less,\u201d Mangione later recounted in a Reddit post. \u201cThey thought I was weird. I thought their mansions were full of lots of bullshit. I suppose I\u2019ve always been hyper-obsessed with efficiency, and I\u2019ve never been very materialistic.\u201d\n\nLou and Kathy both came from large families that were well-respected and had deep ties to Baltimore\u2019s Italian American Catholic community. Kathy, who owns a boutique travel company, was one of eight children in the Zannino family, which owns and operates the Charles S. Zannino Funeral Service. Lou, one of 10 children, was raised to help take over his family\u2019s businesses \u2014 his parents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, built their wealth off construction, commercial real estate, assisted-living facilities, and a radio station, all family-run.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re great, great quality people,\u201d says a friend of Mangione\u2019s parents who asked that his name not be published to protect the family\u2019s privacy. \u201cThey\u2019ve done so much for their community. Mr. Nick made it from nothing. Capitalism runs through their veins.\u201d\n\nLuigi Mangione attended the prestigious, all-boys Gilman School in North Baltimore. Amy Davis/\u201dBaltimore Sun\u201d/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nNick, Mangione\u2019s nonno, was a pillar of the Italian American community. The son of a Sicilian immigrant, he grew up in Baltimore\u2019s Little Italy neighborhood. He started off laying bricks as a contractor and worked to become a successful entrepreneur \u2014 a local restaurant owner remembers him giving opportunities to other Italian Americans with his businesses, including golf courses and health facilities. When he bought Turf Valley Resort in a Baltimore suburb, Nick told a local reporter he faced discrimination from people who accused him of earning his money from Mafia connections, which he denied.\n\nThe Mangiones eventually moved to the suburbs with their large family, but Nick and Mary often returned for events at St. Leo the Great Roman Catholic Church. \u201cThey left physically, but they were [often] here to support festivals, events. When the church was in need, they\u2019d support it monetarily,\u201d says Giovanna Blattermann, a 78-year-old Little Italy cafe owner and hairstylist who used to set family matriarch Mary Mangione\u2019s hair in rollers. Mangione\u2019s mother, aunts, uncles, and cousins often played in the local bocce league with Blattermann. Occasionally, Mangione would sub in for his older cousin Michael, who Blattermann says looks like Mangione\u2019s twin. \u201cHe was a good kid,\u201d she says of Luigi.\n\nAttorney Thomas Maronick Jr. was the Saturday host of an independent talk show that ran for 20 years on the Mangiones\u2019 radio station, WCBM, which leans conservative and has had hosts like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh in its lineup. Before Luigi, the most well-known of the family grandchildren was Nino, a 38-year-old Maryland state delegate who is a Donald Trump supporter. (Mangione\u2019s parents donated to both Republicans and Democrats. Luigi\u2019s 2016 Pennsylvania voter registration didn\u2019t declare a party.)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re viewed very favorably,\u201d Maronick says of the Mangiones. In 1960, the family created the Mangione Family Foundation, which has donated to local philanthropies including the Baltimore Opera Company, the Association of Italian American Charities, and Associated Jewish Charities. They were on the board of trustees at Loyola University Maryland, and the university\u2019s fitness center is named after the Mangione family. Through a family representative, the Mangiones declined to participate in this story; through his attorneys, Luigi declined, as well.\n\n\u201cThey seem to have a lot of clout, [and] to treat people well,\u201d Maronick says. \u201cMy sense is that this is very difficult for them.\u201d\n\nNot Just a School\n\nIn Northern Baltimore, in the affluent neighborhood of Roland Park, the Gilman School sprawls across 57 acres dotted with cherry blossoms. Boys in ties and button-downs shuffle between the grand white-columned buildings on campus. The school\u2019s motto, known as the \u201cGilman Five,\u201d is emblazoned across the dining hall in large silver letters: Honor, Integrity, Respect, Humility, Excellence.\n\nIn Baltimore, Gilman is more than just an institution \u2014 it\u2019s an identity. The nearly $40,000-a-year, all-boys school has a reputation for being one of the most competitive private schools in the area, with alumni who have gone on to become politicians, business moguls, and professional athletes. It\u2019s impossible to talk to anyone in Baltimore about Mangione without them bringing up that he was a Gilman valedictorian.\n\n\u201cLuigi was in this crew of kids you knew were going to do groundbreaking science research.\u201d\n\nMangione\u2019s sisters and many of his cousins went to Catholic private schools in the Baltimore area. Mangione attended a Catholic elementary school, The Immaculate Conception School in Towson, but diverged from the rest of his family by joining Gilman in sixth grade. \u201cIt was unusual that he went to Gilman coming from his family,\u201d says Steve, a Gilman teacher of Mangione\u2019s who asked to use a pseudonym. \u201cI think [Luigi\u2019s parents] understood how precocious he was as a student, as a science kid. Every family in this area knows that if you\u2019ve got a superb kid, and you want them to go to a really good college, you send them to Gilman.\u201d\n\nMangione may have been a name prominent in Baltimore\u2019s Italian American community, but it carried no cachet with the Gilman crowd. \u201cHe had a lot of money, but it wasn\u2019t culturally relevant at Gilman, because everyone has a lot of money,\u201d says James, a former student in Mangione\u2019s grade who asked to use a pseudonym and has previously not spoken to the press. \u201cIf you ask me to rank my class in wealth, he would not have been high.\u201d\n\nThe social hierarchy of Gilman students wasn\u2019t just about money \u2014 although the popular kids were often spotted driving around in the newest luxury cars and partying at multimillion-dollar homes \u2014 it was about lineage. The most popular boys, who had fathers and grandfathers who\u2019d gone to Gilman, and started there as preschoolers, had it easier socially than kids like Mangione, who joined later. And in a town where lacrosse is king, Mangione played soccer and wrestled. There were the socially elite and then there was \u201cthe group of true geniuses,\u201d as James calls them, who were there for the school\u2019s top-tier academics.\n\n\u201cLuigi was in this crew of kids that you knew were going to an Ivy and were going to do groundbreaking science research,\u201d James says. \u201cBut Luigi was the only one [of them] you could shoot the shit with. Once you got him talking, he had all of the kind of suave, cool-guy vibes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was very Gossip Girl, and Luigi was kind of like Dan,\u201d James says of the TV character who came from a different social strata than his private-school classmates. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put words into his mouth, but I always got this feeling that he was really interested in having more of a social life than he had.\u201d\n\nMangione spent a lot of his time at the robotics lab in Gilman\u2019s science building. Once, the boys in the AI club got together at the lab to work on their robot, called Hound Bot, ahead of a competition in Virginia the next day. Hari Menon, who was a sophomore in the club when Mangione, a senior, served as its co-president, recalls that in spite of their efforts, their robot didn\u2019t work. So, Mangione took the lead and suggested going to one of their houses to order pizza and pull an all-nighter. He told the group, \u201cAll right, guys, we\u2019re kind of fucked right now, but it\u2019s OK, we\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d says Menon. \u201cHe was always keeping everybody\u2019s energy up.\u201d\n\nIn high school, Mangione would get to school in the morning at seven to study before classes started. \u201cLuigi was always chasing perfection, because that was his identity: being smart,\u201d says former teacher Steve, who always thought Mangione would grow up to work in a science lab or build AI models. His classmates say he was the kind of kid who\u2019d complain about getting a 98, even when talking to a student ecstatic about getting a 92. There was an arrogance to him, remembers James.\n\nMangione gives his valedictorian speech to the Class of 2016 during commencement at Gilman. Nicole Munchel/\u201dBaltimore Sun\u201d/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nClasses at Gilman were structured more like college courses. As a 10th grader, Mangione would have been reading books by philosophers like Marx, Lenin, and Kant. One teacher Mangione connected with taught a course about U.S. history through the lens of class conflict. The students read Howard Zinn\u2019s A People\u2019s History of the United States, about America from the perspective of marginalized communities.\n\nIn addition to history, Mangione\u2019s interest in video games led him to focus on coding and technology, especially AI and how technology influences society, a subject he addressed in a March 2016 school-assembly speech.\n\n\u201cToday, I will be talking to you about the future, about topics ranging from conscious artificial intelligence to human immortality,\u201d Mangione said from the podium in his navy blazer and blue tie.\n\n\u201cLikely, you\u2019ll dismiss all this pretty quickly as interesting but just science fiction, or worse, you might simply think I\u2019m crazy. But I\u2019m confident I can convince you not only of my sanity, but also that the next hundred years of our future are going to be unlike anything humanity has ever seen before.\u201d\n\nMangione said in the speech that because of tech advances, \u201ca revolutionary near-future isn\u2019t unbelievable, it\u2019s actually the only logical concl\u00adusion.\u201d He talked about the concept of \u201cthe singularity\u201d \u2014 the notion that AI will eventually take over humans \u2014 but urged optimism.\n\n\u201cBe excited for what the future holds for us,\u201d Mangione told the sea of boys. \u201cWe may have been born into one of the most exciting times on Earth, regardless of the singularity. We might not recognize it in our day-to-day lives, but the world is changing fast.\u201d\n\nIvy League-Bound\n\nAfter graduating from Gilman, Mangione took his interest in science and technology to the University of Pennsylvania. He majored in artificial intelligence and minored in mathematics at the Ivy League engineering school. His coursework was rigorous, and he later wrote that he felt like he was putting in twice the amount of work he did at Gilman without as much reward.\n\nHe also struggled with health issues that made studying difficult, including back pain when he sat for long periods of time. He later wrote in a social media post that he suffered from isthmic spondylolisthesis, a condition common among weight lifters and gymnasts where repetitive extension can cause a bone in the spine to slip out and apply pressure on the vertebra below. \u201cIt often occurs from either a single injury or repetitive injuries early on in your teens to early adulthood,\u201d says Dr. Derrick Umansky, an expert in neurosurgery who has not treated Mangione. Back pain in young people is often not immediately investigated, Umansky explains, leaving it to worsen until a patient gets imaging done and eventually a diagnosis of spondylolisthesis.\n\nMangione also dealt with brain fog, which he sometimes suspected was due to a Lyme disease diagnosis when he was a teen. The symptoms worsened his freshman year, which had a significant impact on his life at Penn. People experiencing brain fog often talk about poor attention span, feeling drained, confused, and having difficulty remembering things. \u201cIt\u2019s a vague term, like \u2018fatigue,\u2019\u201d says Dr. Reena Mehta, an allergist who has not treated Mangione. It\u2019s not a medical diagnosis, she explains, but a set of symptoms that can be caused by a variety of factors. Brain fog is still being studied, and Mehta says she often sees patients who have visited numerous doctors in a search for answers. \u201cBy the time they come to me, they\u2019re so frustrated because they\u2019ve seen so many people, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Everybody just calls me crazy or blows me off and says it\u2019s in my head.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cLuigi was always chasing perfection, because his identity was being smart.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Mangione joined Phi Kappa Psi, a fraternity known for attracting studious young men. Their pledging involved drinking alcohol heavily twice a week, Mangione would later describe under the username Mister Cactus, the Reddit account associated with him. He wrote that the drinking and lack of sleep exacerbated his brain fog. He also had stomach pain, digestive issues, and impaired vision, all of which seemed to worsen during this time.\n\n\u201cI simply wasn\u2019t able to recover from a week of disturbed sleep,\u201d Mangione wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely brutal to have such a life-halting issue, especially since the issue itself wears down the critical/logical thinking mind you\u2019d usually use to tackle it \u2026 Struggling to understand lectures and homework is difficult, but having the same level of difficulty when trying to watch YouTube or read an interesting book is even worse.\u201d\n\nStill, Mangione was social and was known as a friendly, charming student. After Mangione\u2019s arrest, one friend told Business Insider, \u201cI would set my sister or friend up with him. Just knowing his personality, I would completely trust him. Even knowing what I know now, if he 100 percent did it, I would feel completely safe being alone in a room with him.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, a Penn Facebook account called \u201cPenn Crushes\u201d tagged Mangione, writing, \u201cHot damn. Are you single? You make us engineers have hope!\u201d He replied, \u201cDespite all my best efforts \u2026 yup still single.\u201d Mangione\u2019s friends from high school said he dated very casually at Gilman, and his postcollegiate Tinder profile said he was interested in meeting women.\n\nAfter his junior year, Mangione went to Stanford University to be a counselor for an AI summer program for gifted high school students. Mangione had attended the same camp when he was a rising senior at Gilman, and had stayed in touch with friends he met there. Mangione\u2019s friend David (who requested a pseudonym) says he was one of the most popular people in their group, so beloved that the others made their names \u201cI love Luigi 1,\u201d \u201cI love Luigi 2,\u201d \u201cI love Luigi 3,\u201d etc., in their Facebook group chat. David says Mangione was always good-natured about the attention. As a camp counselor, he was popular, too. One of his students wrote on Reddit that they had a Discord channel that was dedicated to talking about him.\n\nHis senior year at Penn, the Covid pandemic hit, emptying out the campus, so Mangione missed the final few months of college with his friends. In May 2022, he returned to the Penn campus with his family, who watched him walk across the stage. Despite nearly dropping out because of his health challenges, Mangione completed a program that allowed him to get both a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree in four years, and graduated from Penn with honors.\n\n\u201cHe was such a thoughtful and deeply compassionate person,\u201d said a Hawaii friend.\n\nFocusing on His Health\n\nLater that year, Mangione would sit on the sand with his friends at Magic Island, a peninsula of Oahu that juts out into turquoise water. Mangione had moved to Hawaii after graduation, determined to focus on his health. For his first six months there, Mangione\u2019s home was Surfbreak, a co-living space marketed to digital nomads. He worked remotely as a data engineer at the online car-buying platform TrueCar. He spent his free time hiking, stargazing, and reading. He was known for getting around on his bicycle, and walking his friends home at night. When Mangione first moved to Hawaii, he\u2019d tried surfing, but injured himself and experienced sciatica, pressure on a nerve in his lower back. A few weeks later, he slipped on a piece of paper, and couldn\u2019t put any weight on his right leg for a week. Previously, Mangione only had back pain when standing for too long, but now he ached daily, and eventually began having nerve pain and numbness in his groin and down his right leg.\n\n\u201cStuck being sedentary when you\u2019re an energetic person and used to being so active is one of the worst aspects of sciatica,\u201d Mangione wrote on social media to someone who had described experiencing similar pain. He told the user he\u2019d switched from weight lifting and martial arts to yoga to help with his own pain. His yoga teacher, Dorian Wright, says he modified Mangione\u2019s practice to help with his lower-back pain.\n\nIn October 2022, Mangione moved into a two-bedroom Honolulu high-rise apartment with a roommate, who described him on Reddit last year as a \u201ctruly amazing and caring guy.\u201d He kept in touch with the friends he\u2019d made at Surfbreak by starting a book club with R.J. Martin, Surfbreak\u2019s founder and a former college professor, and Jackie Wexler, a fellow Penn alum Mangione met on Oahu.\n\n\u201cHe was just such a thoughtful and deeply compassionate person at everything he did,\u201d Wexler told Civil Beat, Hawaii\u2019s nonprofit news organization. They read books like The Ape That Understood the Universe: How the Mind and Culture Evolve, by Steve Stewart-Williams; Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell; and What\u2019s Our Problem?, by internet writer Tim Urban. But ultimately, says Danny, a friend of Mangione\u2019s and a member of the book club, who asked not to use his last name, \u201cit was just an excuse to get together for sunset.\u201d\n\nAt the end of February 2023, Mangione messaged a former Gilman classmate saying he\u2019d quit TrueCar recently in order to \u201cspend more time reading and doing yoga.\u201d He added, \u201cData engineering paid super well but was mind-numbingly boring.\u201d\n\nMartin has claimed in interviews that Mangione\u2019s back was so bad by then that it interfered with his sex life. But Mangione\u2019s roommate from that time wrote on Reddit that he spent more time with Mangione than Martin and doesn\u2019t remember him referencing any such problems. Danny also says he never heard that complaint from Mangione.\n\nEither way, Mangione\u2019s back issues were debilitating enough that he decided to move forward with a spinal fusion, briefly traveling home to the East Coast for the surgery in July of that year. It\u2019s unclear what health plan Mangione was on during his surgery and recovery, but a UnitedHealth Group representative tells me neither Mangione nor his parents have ever been insured by the company.\n\nMangione posted an X-ray on social media after having back surgery. Luigi Mangione/X\n\nSeven days after the surgery, Mangione felt he was making such good progress that he stopped taking pain medications. Three months later, he claimed he hadn\u2019t had a bad day since, posting an X-ray of his back on X. \u201cThe surgery wasn\u2019t nearly as scary as I made it out to be in my head,\u201d he wrote to reassure someone on the spondylolisthesis, or \u201cspondy,\u201d Reddit. \u201cRemember that the human body is supposed to exist in a pain-free state. Constant pain means something is wrong. Even with metal in my back, I\u2019m not in pain.\u201d\n\nHis book club had fizzled when Mangione left the island in July, but one of the last books they\u2019d read was the 35,000-word manifesto of Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, who killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995 in an effort to bring attention to technological abuse and how it reduces quality of life.\n\nMartin had jokingly suggested reading the manifesto, and one book-club member recalls the conversation around it being casual and light. Months after discussing it with his friends, in February 2024, Mangione wrote up his review of the manifesto on Goodreads. He called Kaczynski an \u201cextreme political revolutionary\u201d as well as a violent individual who maimed innocent people and was rightfully imprisoned. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to quickly and thoughtless[ly] write this off as a manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies,\u201d Mangione wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\u201d\n\nMangione also quoted another reader\u2019s passage about Kaczynski\u2019s manifesto, which he found \u201cinteresting.\u201d The reader posted online about corporations harming the environment and claimed peaceful protests were too often ignored, arguing that violence was a valid form of self-defense. \u201cWhen all other forms of communication fail,\u201d reads the passage, \u201cviolence is necessary to survive.\u201d\n\nLife in a Backpack\n\nIn February 2024, Mangione texted a friend from the Stanford artificial-intelligence summer program that he was going to miss their annual reunion. \u201cI\u2019m going backpacking for awhile,\u201d he wrote before setting off for a trip throughout Asia with nothing more than his Tortuga-brand bag. \u201cPerhaps the ultimate vessel for minimal, efficient living \u2014 surpassing even a tiny square home \u2014 is a single backpack,\u201d Mangione wrote in the Reddit thread for Onebag, a community of people who travel light for philosophical reasons. \u201cThe constraint of a single bag is a useful practice in intentionality, and it\u2019s a good reminder that we\u2019re able to go long periods of time without needing many things.\u201d\n\nHe hopped around to different countries, sometimes traveling by motorcycle. On Feb. 25, Mangione had dinner and drinks in Tokyo with Japanese professional poker player Jun Obara, who\u2019d overheard him struggling to order. \u201cHe was very friendly,\u201d Obara told NBC.\n\nIn April, while visiting Thailand, Mangione befriended two travelers at a Muay Thai fight in Krabi, and reportedly traveled with them to Bangkok. They claimed that Mangione visited a shooting range during his trip \u2014 a popular activity for tourists there. He also complained about back pain, they said, and turned down going on a hike. (When asked about these details, a rep for Mangione\u2019s legal team declined to comment on his behalf.)\n\nMangione shared photos on social media of post-graduate life in Hawaii. Luigi Mangione/X\n\nThat spring, Mangione traveled through Japan, stopping at Mount \u014cmine, a mountain women are prohibited from climbing. Mangione texted a friend that it was \u201cpeak misogyny\u201d but gave him a chance to \u201cstop getting distracted by women lol.\u201d On April 27, he sent an audio message to a friend about how he wanted to \u201czen out\u201d in the tiny villages on the sides of cliffs in Japan\u2019s Nara region. \u201cIt\u2019s super lush; there\u2019s this beautiful river that cuts through the gorge,\u201d he said in audio reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cI want to stay here for like a month and just meditate and hot-spring and do some writing.\u201d\n\nDuring that time, Mangione continued to interact with the \u201cspondy\u201d back-pain community on Reddit, encouraging members to stand up for themselves if they wanted spinal surgery. \u201cTell them you are \u2018unable to work\u2019/do your job,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe live in a capitalist society. I\u2019ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it\u2019s impacting your quality of life.\u201d\n\nThe Online World\n\nAs Mangione traipsed through Asia, there was one place he returned to again and again: the internet. Since he was young, it had been a place where he sought community, whether by playing video games, exchanging back-pain woes on subreddits, or earnestly journaling about his backpack. But in the spring of 2024, he began pulling away from family and friends in real life, while reaching out online to male writers and personalities he admired.\n\nOne of those writers was Tim Urban, the popular blogger and illustrator who draws stick figures and writes long posts about artificial intelligence, procrastination, and cancel culture for his site, Wait But Why. Elon Musk praised Urban\u2019s book about political polarization, What\u2019s Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies, which Mangione once tweeted would go down in history as \u201cthe most important philosophical text of the early 21st century.\u201d\n\nUrban\u2019s book posits that people in the U.S. have lost the ability to communicate because of \u201cpolitical tribalism.\u201d He criticizes both \u201cTrump Republicans\u201d and \u201cSocial Justice Fundamentalism,\u201d the latter of which, he says, \u201cenforces strict conformity.\u201d\n\nMangione had reached out to Urban in January 2024 to say he appreciated his viewpoints, and Urban told The New York Times they had a \u201chealthy-seeming interaction\u201d in April. Urban says the people Mangione appears to have admired have a basic message in common: \u201cFree speech is good and discourse is good, and the typical style of radical politics is not productive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in a capitalist society,\u201d Mangione wrote last year on social media.\n\nAlso that April, Mangione began emailing with Gurwinder Bhogal, another popular centrist internet writer who decries political tribalism. Mangione subscribed to Bhogal\u2019s Substack about how tech manipulates society.\n\n\u201cJapan is peak NPC-ville,\u201d Mangione wrote in an April 16 email to Bhogal. \u201cScary lack of free will in this country.\u201d NPC stands for non-player character and is used as a derogatory term to describe those who are automated in their behavior and mindless in their belief systems, as if they are controlled by a computer game.\n\nIn his email, Mangione talked about seeing a man having a seizure on the street in Japan and running to a nearby police station. \u201cThey followed me to help, but refused to walk across any empty streets if the stoplight was red, even while the guy was seizing on the ground,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBhogal had blogged about so-called NPCs being on the rise because of how tech companies and algorithms shape human behavior: \u201cStep into social media and you\u2019ll see the same groups of people getting outraged by the same kinds of things every single day, like clockwork.\u201d\n\nOn May 5, the day before his 26th birthday, Mangione had a video call with Bhogal, a perk he\u2019d earned by paying $200 to become a founding member of Bhogal\u2019s Substack. They spoke for two hours. Bhogal\u2019s recollection of their conversation \u2014 their only call \u2014 offers the most detailed public account of Mangione during the months leading up to his arrest. (When asked if Bhogal\u2019s representation of the call was accurate, Mangione\u2019s attorneys declined to comment.)\n\nDuring the call, Bhogal tells me, he got the sense Mangione had been feeling alienated. \u201cHe said to me a couple of times that the people around him were not on the same wavelength as him,\u201d Bhogal says. \u201cHe was interested in improving himself and the world, but felt that both the self-improvement and world-improvement spaces were rife with charlatanry, woke virtue-signaling, and other forms of posturing. He was interested in practical solutions and wanted to be part of a community that made change in rational, evidence-based ways.\u201d\n\nMangione had voiced in social media posts that he wasn\u2019t happy with either of the leading presidential candidates \u2014 Trump or Joe Biden. With Bhogal, Mangione reiterated that stance, but said he liked some aspects of then-long-shot candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., without specifying.\n\nBhogal says that Mangione came across as anti-tribalist, anti-DEI, pro-free speech, pro-equality, and anti-consumerism. Mangione\u2019s opposition to corporate greed was not mentioned in the context of health care, Bhogal says, but rather in the realm of technology and algorithms. (Outside of a passing comment that Mangione made about Bhogal being lucky to live in the U.K. when it comes to health care, the topic didn\u2019t come up.) Bhogal remembers Mangione saying he felt like tech giants were polarizing society to increase their profits, that he felt manipulated by rage bait and sensationalist media, and asked Bhogal for advice on curating his social feed.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t like that people were being pushed into echo chambers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t like the fact that people were being sort of pigeonholed, pushed into these boxes, into these echo chambers,\u201d Bhogal says. \u201cThis was leading to alienation, because people were not really connecting with even their own families sometimes, you know, because they have different political views.\u201d\n\nThroughout the spring and into summer, Mangione kept active on X, telling political journalist Nate Silver he supported term limits and retweeting the controversial neuroscientist podcaster Andrew Huberman and a speech by far-right billionaire Peter Thiel. He was also a fan of Jonathan Haidt, and reposted the author\u2019s promotions of his book The Anxious Generation, about how smartphones impact childhood mental health.\n\nWhile traveling in Mumbai in May, Mangione met up with Jash Dholani, an Indian author and internet personality. Mangione had previously tried to buy 400 copies of Dholani\u2019s e-book Hit Reverse: New Ideas From Old Books, but the transaction was flagged and rejected, so he bought a single copy. \u201cWe discussed his travel experiences and the conversation seemed normal,\u201d Dholani later tweeted about the hourlong interaction.\n\nMangione, once very active on Reddit, made his final post on the platform on May 25. In a subreddit dedicated to the Una\u00adbomber, he shared a video called \u201cStreaming Overdose 2024, China.\u201d It depicted people staring into their phone screens, livestreaming them\u00adselves.\n\nMissing Person\n\nWhile Mangione traveled last summer, he lost touch with many of his friends and family in the U.S. In July, a childhood friend reached out to ask Mangione if he was still going to be a part of his upcoming wedding, which was to be held at Hayfields Country Club, one of the clubs the Mangione family owned. Mangione had been unresponsive to his friend\u2019s texts but eventually got in touch on July 9, law enforcement confirms, sending a detailed message that nobody understood him and life had become difficult. The friend didn\u2019t hear from him again after that.\n\nA month later, on Aug. 31, one of Mangione\u2019s neighbors saw him moving out of his Honolulu apartment. The property manager told Hawaii\u2019s local news channel KHON that Mangione didn\u2019t provide an explanation for why he was leaving. The next month, Mangione quietly dropped out of the Penn alumni WhatsApp group he\u2019d joined when he first moved to the island.\n\nDespite her son\u2019s lack of contact, one friend of Kathy\u2019s says when he asked where her son was, Kathy answered, \u201cLuigi\u2019s such a genius, he wants to do his own thing and has moved to Hawaii.\u201d But behind closed doors, members of the Mangione family were reaching out to friends from different parts of his life in an attempt to contact him. \u201cHave you heard anything from [Luigi] in the past couple months?\u201d Mangione\u2019s cousin asked one of Luigi\u2019s Gilman classmates on Sept. 21. \u201cOr know anyone who has?\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 30, a friend asked Mangione on X if he was OK. \u201cNo one has heard from you in months and apparently your family is looking for you,\u201d he wrote in a public message. Another friend tweeted at him in November saying, \u201cKnow you are missed and loved.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 18, Kathy filed a missing persons report in San Francisco, where TrueCar, at which she thought Luigi still worked, had an office. She told police officers she\u2019d last spoken to her son in July. When police investigated, they discovered the company had closed its office in the city. The only evidence they found connecting Mangione to San Francisco was a bank withdrawal there in August.\n\nThe first investigator assigned to the case, Sgt. Joe Siragusa, had a long conversation with Kathy, who also connected him to the friend whose September wedding Mangione had missed. The friend claimed Mangione had grown apart from his friends and family, had undergone a back surgery that had changed him physically and mentally, and had been microdosing mushrooms, which the friend believed had affected him mentally, as well, according to Siragusa\u2019s notes. (The friend didn\u2019t respond to interview requests. Mangione\u2019s legal team declined to comment.)\n\nDuring the first few days of December, Kathy and Lou told family friends they\u2019d completely lost contact with Luigi and had no idea where he was. Distraught, Kathy continued to call the San Francisco Police Department asking for updates on the case. Police couldn\u2019t find any new phone numbers or addresses, so it seemed to them like Mangione had intentionally disappeared.\n\nConnected to a Crime\n\nIn the early morning hours of Wednesday, Dec. 4, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson left the Luxury Collection Hotel in midtown Manhattan. He was in New York for the company\u2019s annual investor conference, scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. one block away.\n\nAs Thompson reached the entrance of the Hilton, a masked person in a black hooded windbreaker and gray Peak Design backpack crossed the street and came up behind him. Around 6:45 a.m., the assassin raised a partially 3D-printed gun and shot Thompson three times in the back and leg. Thompson collapsed to the ground, and the masked shooter ran down an alley between West 54th and 55th streets before hopping on an e-bike and riding uptown toward Central Park.\n\nTwo and a half hours later, police in Maple Grove, Minnesota, arrived at the house of Paulette Thompson, Brian\u2019s estranged wife and mother of their two children, to let her know the 50-year-old executive had been killed.\n\nA national manhunt ensued, as law enforcement released video and images of the masked suspect. Social media exploded into debates about the health-insurance industry, with many people saying UnitedHealthcare has a reputation for excessive claim denials. (A rep for UnitedHealthcare flatly denies this, saying, \u201cWe ultimately pay 98 percent of all claims received that are for eligible members. For the two percent of claims that are not approved, the majority are instances where the services did not meet the benefit criteria. Only 0.5 percent of claims are not approved based on clinical evidence and patient safety.\u201d)\n\nPolice officers stand near the scene where the CEO of United Healthcare Brian Thompson was shot and killed in Midtown Manhattan on December 4. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters/Redux\n\nThe public\u2019s frustration with the American insurance industry and CEOs morphed into an unprecedented and unsettling celebration of a person accused of murdering a man in cold blood \u2014 a disturbing snapshot of a fractured society. \u201cWanted\u201d posters of other health care chief executives appeared around New York. People online gushed about how attractive the suspect was, and some X users offered to help hide him in their homes. There was talk of a hotline executives could call if they feared for their lives. Corporate leaders amped up security, shielding their identities on websites, and sending emails about flying exclusively on private jets.\n\nWhen San Francisco Police Sgt. Michael Horan looked at the smiling suspect in one of the security photos released, he remembers thinking to himself, \u201cSomebody\u2019s going to recognize that guy.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Horan\u2019s partner, Siragusa, asked him to take a look at a missing-persons case, a former Ivy League student from Baltimore named Luigi Mangione. \u201cThis one\u2019s weird,\u201d Horan remembers Siragusa saying as he dropped off the case file. \u201cThis guy completely went off the grid in July.\u201d\n\nHoran dove in, scrolling through tagged photos of Mangione on his Instagram. Then he realized something: That smile. Those eyebrows. They looked familiar. He pulled up the surveillance photo on one of his monitors, and Mangione\u2019s Instagram on the other. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d he remembers thinking.\n\nHoran took the suspicion to his colleagues and supervisors, and then called the New York FBI agent handling the Thompson case. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you with this,\u201d Horan recalls saying. \u201cWe\u2019re over in San Francisco, but I want to give you this info.\u201d\n\nThat weekend, an assassin look-alike contest was held in New York\u2019s Washington Square Park, and the FBI interviewed the Mangione family. On Sunday, Dec. 8, Kathy and Lou went to church services in Little Italy. Others who attended say they couldn\u2019t tell by the couple\u2019s behavior that anything was amiss. The next day, Mangione was taken into custody at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Investigators say he was detained with the fake ID he gave at the hostel, a backpack containing a partially 3D-printed gun, bullets, a spiral notebook, and a 261-word letter to the FBI.\n\nThe handwritten letter, which many media outlets refused to publish but was posted by independent reporter Ken Klippenstein to his Substack, allegedly began: \u201cTo the Feds, I\u2019ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering so probably not much info there. I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\u201d\n\nThe letter reportedly goes on to detail issues with the health care system, including UnitedHealthcare, and to decry corporations that \u201cabuse Americans for immense profit \u2026 It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cEvidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 10, as Mangione was being escorted into Pennsylvania court for an extradition hearing, he turned to shout at the press lined up snapping photos and video. His words were muffled, but his legal team confirms his statement: \u201cYour coverage of this event is completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nobody Could Believe It\u2019\n\nOver the past four months, Mangione has made headlines around the world. Graffiti supporting him popped up in the South of France; the underground London music scene displayed his photo behind DJ sets; Saturday Night Live teased the people thirsting over his abs; to \u201cLuigi\u201d someone became a synonym for \u201cto kill.\u201d\n\nBack in Mangione\u2019s hometown, the conversation was one of disbelief. Within minutes of his name being released as the shooting suspect, his Gilman classmates\u2019 cellphones started blowing up. \u201cDid you see the news?\u201d \u201cOMG, Luigi?!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d That month, at Gilman, a student pointed to Mangione\u2019s name displayed in gold lettering alongside the other valedictorians in the lobby. \u201cAre we going to take that down?\u201d he asked a teacher standing nearby. \u201cI hope not,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cHe\u2019s still a part of Gilman history.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one has heard from you in months, and your family is looking for you,\u201d a friend wrote on X.\n\nIn Little Italy, residents were stunned and crestfallen to hear a Mangione was arrested for the crime. \u201cEverybody was dumbfounded,\u201d says Arthur Gentile, a longtime resident. \u201cNobody could believe it. It\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nThe extended Mangione family went on lockdown, maintaining a tight circle of trust. His parents stopped opening their mail. His sisters deleted their social media accounts. Friends dropped off baked goods at their home. \u201cWe only know what we have read in the media,\u201d the Mangione family said in a statement released Dec. 9. \u201cOur family is shocked and devastated by Luigi\u2019s arrest. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson, and we ask people to pray for all involved. We are devastated by this news.\u201d Mangione\u2019s legal team declined to comment when asked if he\u2019s been in touch with his family since his incarceration.\n\nThose who\u2019ve known the Mangiones couldn\u2019t imagine that someone in the family would be accused of such a violent and brazen crime. \u201cHe\u2019s stained their name,\u201d says a friend of the family. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve done so much for the community. My heart bleeds for them.\u201d\n\nIn Little Italy, some I spoke with blamed his Ivy League education. Blattermann, the cafe owner, was especially insulted by a Penn professor who called Mangione the \u201cicon we all need and deserve.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s telling,\u201d Blattermann says. \u201cWhat are you infusing their brains with?\u201d (The professor retracted her statement and apologized after an uproar.) Blattermann sees the crime as a tragedy for both the Mangione and Thompson families.\n\nJames, the Gilman classmate, says that since December he\u2019s spent a lot of time thinking about how many young men are \u201con the brink\u201d and how he has friends who he would not be surprised to hear had carried out an audacious crime. \u201cHow many back injuries are we away from acts of violence?\u201d he says. \u201cI think if we really knew the true extent of the issue, it would be pretty horrifying.\u201d\n\nIn Maple Grove, Minnesota, Paulette Thompson posted a statement on her front door: \u201cWe are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian. Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed.\u201d\n\nMedia Circus\n\nOn Thursday, Dec. 19, freelance photographer Alan Chin got a call from The New York Times. He was to immediately grab his camera and get to the Wall Street helipad on the East River. Mangione was arriving from Pennsylvania and was being transported to a Manhattan courthouse. \u201cMake sure you bring your long lens,\u201d the editor told Chin.\n\nWhen Chin got to the pier, there was a line of photographers \u2014 and one face he was surprised to see: the photographer for the mayor\u2019s office. An official walked up to the photographers and said Mayor Eric Adams would be attending the perp walk and have a short press conference after. She assured the group of photographers jostling for their position: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re going to get that shot. It\u2019s going to happen right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unusual for the mayor, or any elected official, to be part of a perp walk,\u201d Chin says. \u201cThey could have done this without anyone seeing it,\u201d he adds, explaining that photographers\u2019 angles were limited because the heliport is on a pier. \u201cAnd we would not have seen any of it unless we had been on a boat.\u201d\n\nThe walk took less than six seconds. Mangione turned the corner from the helicopter and faced the group of photographers head-on. Sporting a fresh haircut, he walked with his head up in his bright-orange jumpsuit, hands shackled in front of him, Mayor Adams in a suit walking just to his right. The images drew comparisons between Mangione and the Joker, Superman, and even to Jesus. For Mangione\u2019s supporters, the perp walk seemed to cement his status as a modern-day folk hero. Other social media users saw the reaction to the photos as evidence that the public lionizes light-skinned suspects while demonizing people of color.\n\nFor Karen Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione\u2019s lawyer, the entire incident was a threat to Mangione\u2019s right to a fair trial. \u201cHe was on display in the biggest staged perp walk I have ever seen in my career,\u201d Agnifilo said on Dec. 23 at New York State Supreme Court. \u201cYour Honor, he\u2019s not a symbol. He\u2019s somebody who is afforded the right to a fair trial. He\u2019s innocent until proven guilty.\u201d\n\nAt the hearing, Mangione pleaded not guilty to the 11 charges against him in New York, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism. In addition to the charges against him there and in Pennsylvania, he faces federal charges involving stalking and murder through use of a firearm, which makes him eligible for the death penalty.\n\nSince then, Mangione has been held at MDC in Brooklyn, along with disgraced rapper Sean Combs and former crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried. Mangione\u2019s supporters have sent him so many letters he hasn\u2019t been able to keep up with replies.\n\nOn Feb. 21, a couple of months after he was detained, a protest takes place supporting Mangione and health care reform at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, where he\u2019s scheduled to arrive for a brief pretrial appearance. I talk to three friends in their twenties about why they came out in the freezing cold. One wears a T-shirt printed with a photo of Mangione, shirtless. \u201cI do think he\u2019s hot, so I got this shirt,\u201d Hunter Doradea says. \u201cBut I wanted to come out here to support, because I want to shift the narrative to health care reform. Luigi has bipartisan support among the working class for a reason.\u201d\n\nDoradea\u2019s friend Fiona Miller adds, \u201cThe fact that Luigi has garnered so much attention is because everybody knows somebody that\u2019s been fucked over by the health care industry. There\u2019s a lot of anger in this country and resentment toward health care CEOs, and just CEOs in general. [Americans\u2019] rights to have healthy bodies is determined by wealth, and people are really sick of that.\u201d\n\nMangione sits with his lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo last month at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse. STEVEN HIRSCH/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAgnifilo may say her client is a person and not a symbol, but the truth is, he\u2019s both. As I leave the friends, I\u2019m handed a sticker of Mangione depicted as a saint, the same one that hung at Vito\u2019s Pizza. A woman nearby sells T-shirts with the image. Protest organizers hand out information on how to get politically engaged about health care reform. A truck displaying St. Luigi on an LED screen drives by and the crowd erupts into cheers.\n\nInside the courthouse, a slew of reporters are waiting for Mangione. \u201cMake him look sexy,\u201d a photographer tells a videographer trying to figure out angles and lighting. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a folk hero in a while,\u201d one court reporter says to another, commenting on the size of the crowd. An hour later, Mangione shuffles in, wearing a forest-green cable-knit sweater, brown loafers, and a bulletproof vest. He holds his chin up and looks straight ahead.\n\nAgnifilo says in court that day that federal authorities are still deciding whether or not to seek the death penalty. She thinks there were search-and-seizure issues from Mangione\u2019s arrest in Pennsylvania. And she believes his right to a fair trial has been impacted by news articles and documentaries, which continue to make details of the case public.\n\n\u201cI want to just bring to Your Honor\u2019s attention my shock that the chief of detectives of the NYPD, along with the New York City mayor, had time to sit down with HBO [for a documentary] and put hair and makeup on and provide information about the arrest, the prosecution, their theory about the case, and evidence about Mr. Mangione that we have not even received,\u201d Agnifilo says to the judge. \u201cThis journal that they\u2019re calling his manifesto, we have never been provided copies.\u201d\n\nWhen Mangione is eventually escorted out of the courtroom, he gazes over to where his supporters sit. He scans their faces briefly, facial expression unchanged, and then is led out into the hallway. Hours later, a photo of his cuffed, bare ankles goes viral.\n\nContributor LORENA O\u2019NEIL wrote about the battle over church and state happening in Louisiana classrooms for the January issue.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Undervalued High Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other most undervalued high quality stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIs a Market Rally Around The Corner?\n\nIn one of our recent articles, titled 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now, we talked about how the recent tariffs have caused a slowdown in the market and are likely to cause inflation. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\n\u201cToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about how the market is likely to proceed forward from here. Lee stated that he is still optimistic about the market, he acknowledged that investors are sitting out at the moment as they are trying to assess the severity of these tariffs. However as a result the market is seeing a big price correction and a decline in sentiment. Moreover, Lee noted that we also had a bad ADP jobs report and the market is going up on bad news which he believes is good for the market.\n\nLee explained what has happened during the six weeks essentially represents a bear market that has swept through sentiment and positioning because if we look at the hedge funds positioning it has almost gone neutral. Lee believes because of this the current and two upcoming months can be huge rally months, where the market can be rallying as much as 10% to 15%.\n\nWhile answering the question of whether this slowdown is a Buy, Lee noted that the 10 best days happen every year for the market. Last year the 10 best days of the year added up to 21% to the S&P 500, excluding these 10 days the market was only up 4%. He explained that markets don\u2019t get 20% gains throughout the year, it is those 10 best days where the market rallies the most. Lee thinks that these 10 best days for 2025 are near because if the economy is near stall speed, the \u201cTrump Put\u201d will come back, otherwise, the market has to unwind all this austerity. Moreover, if the job market is soft, the \u201cFed Put\u201d comes back into play, because the Fed does not want the stall speed to linger. Lee thinks these two things are going to be the positive catalysts in the next couple of weeks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 10 most undervalued high-quality stocks to buy according to analysts, we used the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF. Using the ETF we aggregated a list of high-quality stocks trading below the S&P 500\u2019s forward P/E ratio of 22 as per the Wall Street Journal. Next, we checked the analyst upside potential for each stock from CNN and ranked the stocks in ascending order of the upside potential. We have also added the number of hedge funds holding each stock, sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 hedge funds database. Please note that the data was collected on March 6, 2025.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 15.94\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\n\nAnalyst Upside Potential: 33.44%\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a large healthcare company that operates through two main business segments including Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Through Optum the company provides a variety of healthcare services, including data analytics, pharmacy services, healthcare delivery, and population health management. On the other hand, the UnitedHealthcare segment offers health insurance and benefits to different groups.\n\nOn March 5, J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill maintained a Buy rating on the stock. The positive outlook from the analyst was based on the recent legal developments involving the company and the Department of Justice. Gill noted that the Special Master\u2019s report recommended granting UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) motion for summary judgment, indicating that the DOJ failed to adequately prove that UnitedHealth knowingly retained overpayments from unsupported diagnosis codes. This suggests a higher burden of proof for the DOJ, which is seen as a positive development for the company.\n\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reflected growth across both its business segments. The company grew its 2024 revenue by 8% year-over-year to reach $400.3 billion. The results were driven by growth in domestic consumers served under UnitedHealthcare which grew to 2.1 million and value-based clients served under Optum which grew to 600,000. It is one of the most undervalued high-quality stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Amazon, ServiceNow, and Gartner during the quarter. We trimmed our position in UnitedHealth to fund the purchase of CoStar Group. Despite short-term margin headwinds, our long-term expectations for UnitedHealth Group remain virtually unchanged, with the trim simply reflecting what we view as a superior investment alternative.\u201d\n\nOverall, UNH ranks 2nd on our list of most undervalued high quality stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Illustration by Jandos Rothstein\n\nValerie O\u2019Meara had been working as a nurse for the Polyclinic in Seattle for over a month before it dawned on her that she actually worked for the risk adjustment department of the health insurance juggernaut UnitedHealth.\n\nA physician had interviewed her for the job. Her employment contract named a gastroenterologist she had never met as the owner and medical director of the practice. But it was a risk adjustment manager Zooming in from Minnesota, where UnitedHealth is based, who told her where to report for duty each morning and increasingly micromanaged her patient visits. \u201cAren\u2019t you using the QuantaFlo to check if your patients have peripheral artery disease?\u201d the risk adjustment guy would ask. She had never heard of a QuantaFlo, or proactively trying to test random Medicare patients for a condition as obscure and slow-moving as peripheral artery disease (PAD).\n\n\u201cScreening asymptomatic patients for peripheral artery disease is not a thing,\u201d she told him, vaguely annoyed that someone with no apparent clinical experience whatsoever would second-guess her medical judgement. She didn\u2019t realize at the time that it most definitely was a thing, not only at UnitedHealth\u2014which had used QuantaFlo to diagnose more than a million patients with PAD between 2018 and 2021 and billed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services an extra $4 billion over that period for \u201ccovering\u201d it\u2014but at pretty much every major national provider of privatized Medicare Advantage insurance plans.\n\nMore from Maureen Tkacik\n\nHealth care corporations have been defrauding Medicare by claiming to treat patients who are not actually sick for diseases they don\u2019t actually have since the dawn of the Medicare system. But during the 1990s, lobbyists convinced Republican lawmakers that they could fix the problem of widespread \u201covertreatment\u201d of patients if only the government handed over the Medicare budget to insurance companies and allowed them to decide how much care senior citizens truly \u201cneeded.\u201d And so over time, the insurance companies displaced nursing homes and for-profit hospital chains (hi, Rick Scott) as the most prodigious looters of Medicare, by convincing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to fork over ever-larger flat fees for the service of covering ever more esoteric diseases.\n\nExpand Courtesy Valerie O\u2019Meara Nurse Valerie O\u2019Meara\n\nA diagnosis of PAD, by way of example, pads the annual payment an insurer receives for covering a Medicare Advantage patient by about $2,500, according to a series The Wall Street Journal published last summer. UnitedHealth alone collects some $8.5 billion every year for covering supposed maladies no doctor has ever treated, according to the Journal. Added to fictitious maladies a doctor may have treated at one time and other scams, Medicare Advantage fraud is estimated to cost the federal government at least $100 billion a year in unnecessary overpayments, according to most of the think tanks that have studied the issue. Even Medicare Advantage boosters like Ezekiel Emanuel estimate the program costs between $20 billion and $30 billion more than it should, making bogus insurance company\u2013concocted diagnoses the single most conspicuous source of fraud, waste, and abuse in the federal budget, not that DOGE has found it yet.\n\nThe problem is that for decades now the laws that prohibit defrauding Medicare have been under attack by a cabal of lobbyists, conservative judges, and cynical wonks who essentially believe rampant Medicare fraud is the price America must pay to nurture insurance companies willing to perform the odious task of cutting senior citizens off when their lives have gotten too costly to sustain. \u201cThe line I would hear every time I brought up\u201d some questionable billing practice, says O\u2019Meara, \u201cis, this is just what you have to do to survive in value-based care, and \u2018CMS says we can do it, so it\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut she didn\u2019t think it was OK, and after quitting the Polyclinic last spring and reading a lot of books, articles, and white papers on \u201cvalue-based care,\u201d she reached out to Wall Street Journal reporter Anna Mathews to talk about what she had experienced. That call turned into the aforementioned series detailing UnitedHealth\u2019s efforts to milk the Medicare Advantage program while systematically denying coverage to patients it ostensibly covered.\n\nThen in late January, after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, O\u2019Meara got a call from an assistant U.S. attorney, claiming to be conducting an investigation into Medicare Advantage fraud at UnitedHealth. On January 31, two Department of Justice litigators interviewed her for an hour. Exactly a week later, the agency contacted QuantaFlo manufacturer Semler Scientific to ask if the company was interested in engaging in talks to settle a long-dormant investigation it had initiated eight years earlier. Those talks lasted all of a single day, according to a disclosure Semler filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week. \u201cWe do not believe the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated,\u201d the filing stated. The stock plunged more than 20 percent after briefly soaring on the unrelated announcement of Trump\u2019s Strategic Crypto Reserve; for the past year, Semler Scientific has been converting a large portion of its cash flows into Bitcoin.\n\nFor decades now, the laws that prohibit defrauding Medicare have been under attack by a cabal of lobbyists, conservative judges, and cynical wonks.\n\nWhat is shocking about these investigations is that they appear to have intensified, even as the Trump administration has repeatedly signaled its intention to accelerate the privatization of Medicare while moving aggressively to shut down corporate malfeasance investigations\u201489 cases against corporations have been halted or dismissed thus far, according to research from Public Citizen\u2014and reassign attorneys to litigate the swelling ranks of lawsuits challenging the administration\u2019s authority to dismantle the federal government.\n\nThe spectacle of DOJ attorneys defending such blatantly illegal acts as firing the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, who by default was positioned to know more about the scope of Medicare fraud than almost anyone, while also investigating Medicare fraud, is hard to fit into your brain at the same time. UnitedHealth has long recruited its lobbyist army from both sides of the aisle, and its most recent strategies have been redolent of MAGA swagger. Longtime Trump official Adam Boehler, who is currently reported to be in Qatar leading unprecedented \u201cbilateral\u201d hostage negotiations with Hamas, sold his home health agency to UnitedHealth in 2021 and calls himself a close personal friend of Brian Thompson, the chief executive officer allegedly murdered in December by Luigi Mangione. Earlier this year, UnitedHealth hired Federalist Society\u2013adjacent defamation law firm Clare Locke to strike back against Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a plastic surgeon who had posted a video on TikTok from the parking lot of her hospital, incredulously relating the story of the UnitedHealth employee who had interrupted her surgery on a breast cancer patient to deny the patient\u2019s claim. The company\u2019s official response to news of the federal investigation is an angry diatribe against The Wall Street Journal\u2019s \u201cyear-long campaign\u201d of \u201cmisinformation\u201d to \u201cto defend a legacy system that rewards volume over keeping patients healthy.\u201d\n\nBut there are signs the unexpected bipartisan outpouring of popular support for Mangione, especially among UnitedHealth policyholders, may have influenced the administration\u2019s decision to play hardball with the health care colossus. Trump backer and hedge fund influencer Bill Ackman posted a long missive detailing his investigation into Dr. Potter\u2019s accusations and the insurer\u2019s smear campaign against her and concluding \u201cthere is likely something systemically wrong with this company.\u201d The following week, Elon Musk greeted news of the DOJ investigation with an approving post: \u201cNot that it justifies murder, but maybe Luigi knew something.\u201d Shortly after, Steve Bannon suggested that the crowds lining up to cheer on Mangione in court and even donate to his $652,000 legal defense fund are evidence of \u201cseething anger underneath \u2026 a certain part of the population\u201d that \u201cdon\u2019t feel like the insurance companies are looking out for their interests.\u201d The administration, Bannon said, should view this as a \u201cflashing red\u201d signal that they needed to look at \u201calternative models\u201d of health care delivery.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have this kind of situation where you have this anger and it boils over to people gunning down people, shooting them in the back in the middle of midtown Manhattan,\u201d he told The Free Press in December. \u201cYou\u2019re literally gonna have a French Revolution, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to avoid.\u201d\n\nTHE LAUNCH AND/OR PRESERVATION OF THE CIVIL INVESTIGATION into UnitedHealth\u2019s billing practices, which is also the subject of a sprawling year-old federal antitrust probe, comes at an especially weird time, as the agency is still litigating a 14-year-old case about the company\u2019s rampant use of fake diagnoses to juice revenues. That litigation is not going well. Earlier this week, a former judge appointed as a \u201cspecial master\u201d to sift through discovery in the case issued a baffling opinion recommending the judge dismiss it entirely. The 50-page ruling, in which the judge essentially accuses the government of trying to prosecute innocent clerical errors, makes for an insane read for anyone familiar with the facts of the case as originally laid out in the whistleblower complaint filed by Ben Poehling, a former risk adjustment executive, in 2011. \u201cWhen I first saw Ben\u2019s case, I immediately sold all my shares in the company,\u201d a former UnitedHealth executive tells the Prospect.\n\nPoehling\u2019s case dates back to 2005, when UnitedHealth bought a massive California-based HMO called PacifiCare that had specialized in Medicare patients. Two years earlier, George W. Bush\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under the direction of Tom Scully, had introduced the concept of the \u201crisk score,\u201d by which Medicare HMOs were reimbursed for covering patients commensurate with a patient\u2019s relative \u201crisk\u201d of needing expensive care. It was an open secret throughout PacifiCare that its doctors had been \u201cincentivized\u201d to concoct phony diagnoses in order to juice its scores. At least 30 percent of the diagnoses on patients\u2019 charts were not supported by a cursory glance at their medical records, the lawsuit claims, and by 2008 this \u201copen secret\u201d had reached the highest levels of UnitedHealth. By 2011, subsequent audits suggested the number of bogus diagnoses among practices in California and Texas that had profit-sharing contracts with PacifiCare was closer to 45 percent. A practice called Edinger had reported alcohol and drug dependence in its patients at more than triple the rate of the broader population; another called CAIPA reported more than triple the rate of chronic hepatitis.\n\nUnlike a bogus MRI or an unnecessary hospital stay, this new wrinkle required CMS to pay PacifiCare a substantial additional sum of money every year until the patient died. So the agency had begun to vow to crack down on conspicuous cases of abuse. Poehling flagged the problem repeatedly with his superiors, who in turn alerted the UnitedHealth compliance department. Over the 20 years that followed the insurance giant\u2019s buyout of PacifiCare, UnitedHealth repeatedly convened efforts to review random samples of its patients\u2019 medical charts for signs of fraud, only to use the exercise as a kind of mass training session for how to squeeze out more profits from the government.\n\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s CMS, under the direction of Tom Scully, had introduced the concept of the \u201crisk score,\u201d by which Medicare HMOs were reimbursed.\n\nTo diagnose these conditions, the insurer proceeded to buy up dozens of medical practices in every corner of the country. But the doctors they acquired were not as easy to \u201cincentivize\u201d as the ones at Edinger and CAIPA had been for PacifiCare. \u201cThey were always saying, doctors are stuck in the past, they don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 value-based care,\u201d says O\u2019Meara. \u201cThat was supposed to be my job.\u201d But O\u2019Meara soon realized she didn\u2019t totally \u201cget\u201d it either.\n\nO\u2019Meara\u2019s job title was \u201cembedded NP,\u201d and it was a new one for UnitedHealth. It was supposed to involve a mix of duties: helping out at the clinic and a sister practice to see patients who hadn\u2019t seen a primary care provider since the COVID lockdowns and plugging in other \u201ccare gaps\u201d; training physicians at a partner clinic in the ways of value-based care; and occasional home visits of patients who were either bedbound, hadn\u2019t been seen for multiple years by any health care provider and needed to be tracked down, or whose names simply popped up on the risk adjustment guy\u2019s algorithms for one reason or another. \u201cYou need to think of this as a startup,\u201d a population health physician told her when she complained that the role was too nebulous.\n\nThe office managers were particularly grateful for her help: The clinics had seen a mass physician exodus since the UnitedHealth acquisition, and they lost five orthopedic surgeons right after she took the job. Every primary care physician had so many patients that they were not allowed to take on new ones, but UnitedHealth kept squeezing new Medicare Advantage enrollees onto their schedules. O\u2019Meara quickly realized that she couldn\u2019t refill medications or get back to a patient on lab test results if she was out visiting a nursing home or trying to train doctors at a network practice with a totally different electronic medical records system. And she eventually gleaned that she hadn\u2019t actually been hired to \u201cfill care gaps\u201d even if there were plenty of gaps needing to be filled. \u201cCare\u201d was more like a pretext for what the risk adjustment guy needed her to do, which was gain access to patients\u2019 medical records so as to add new diagnoses to their charts.\n\nThe easiest way to do this was to show up at a patient\u2019s visit with a specialist and spend 15 to 20 minutes running a software program called Clinovations, which would scan a patient\u2019s medical record and spit out as many as 20 new illnesses or conditions to screen. In theory, the doctors were supposed to run the algorithm themselves, but \u201cit\u2019s so time-consuming I don\u2019t understand how anyone expected them to do that.\u201d NPs were allowed to diagnose certain things like PAD or secondary hyperaldosteronism, which O\u2019Meara\u2019s bosses claimed she could add to the chart of any patient with congestive heart failure on her own. But she felt much more comfortable checking with a specialist physician first, which is how she learned that the clinic\u2019s nephrologists did not endorse Clinovations\u2019 liberal approach to secondary hyperaldosteronism. (Neither do most doctors outside UnitedHealth, whose Medicare Advantage patients are 40 times likelier to be diagnosed with the condition than traditional Medicare patients.) Sometimes the algorithm would prompt her to pore over long-ago chest X-rays for signs of \u201caortic calcification,\u201d or screen a patient for serious mental illnesses despite their exhibiting no signs of suffering from one.\n\nHome visits were even more enigmatic. Once, she found herself outside a halfway house looking for a patient no one knew; she later learned that major depressive, bipolar, and paranoid disorders could add an \u201cadjustment\u201d in excess of $4,000 per year to UnitedHealth\u2019s annual premium for a patient. Another time, she drove five hours and took two ferry rides to see a homebound man who simply needed someone to refill his prescriptions, a task UnitedHealth could have easily accomplished through the mail. \u201cThere was this attitude that because I was a nurse, I could go anywhere without an appointment,\u201d O\u2019Meara says. \u201cBut the culture around everything was so pushy and sometimes desperate, it felt more like sales.\u201d\n\nThere was a twist, because every day brought a new \u201cmystery mission.\u201d She began to read more about the philosophy of value-based care and compared notes with a friend who had been working at the insurer\u2019s Home Visits subsidiary. The puzzle pieces began to click together. They had both been hired specifically to add bogus diagnoses to patients\u2019 charts; they just hadn\u2019t quite realized it because the actual institutions through which the insurer came into contact with its patients were so hollowed out and chaotic. The algorithms had been \u201cnudging\u201d them in that direction, but no one had ever reprimanded her for refusing to be nudged. It felt like a perfect crime.\n\nStill, she was glad to tell the assistant U.S. attorneys all she knew, and she was impressed when one said she had been working on UnitedHealth since Poehling had been working undercover as a whistleblower. In a mind-numbingly specific amended complaint naming no fewer than 73 UnitedHealth executives, Poehling, armed with an arsenal of internal company documents, details how efforts to purge the fake diseases and refund CMS were repeatedly scrapped. One group of executives pushed the auditors to step up their efforts to scour the charts for new unlisted diagnoses, while another lobbied CMS\u2014in vain\u2014to essentially give them permission to continue defrauding the agency, at one point threatening to sue the government if it refused to credit the company for new maladies unearthed in the process of deleting (or thinking about deleting) bogus diagnoses. Finally in 2014, three bosses, including the late Brian Thompson, decided to scrap the \u201cchart verification\u201d effort entirely and pretend it never happened.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine how Special Master Suzanne Segal, a retired judge and mediator for hire to whom the appointed judge has apparently outsourced the case\u2014Medicare Advantage\u2013style?\u2014was able to conclude, as she did this week, that Poehling and the Justice Department were \u201clacking any evidence.\u201d Segal criticized the DOJ for failing to present specific evidence that certain patients\u2019 medical records conflicted with their risk scores, but this likely stems from a failure during the discovery process, during which UnitedHealth repeatedly refused to comply with the government\u2019s \u201conerous\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d demands and Segal frequently sided with the health care juggernaut.\n\nO\u2019Meara is not optimistic that Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s new investigation into the abuses it has promoted for two decades now will be any more successful, but she was impressed that investigators had not given up the fight. \u201cThe system works this way because the people in power are really, really invested in \u2018value based care,\u2019\u201d sighs O\u2019Meara, whose own background research has led her to \u201ccredit\u201d Obama health reform czar Zeke Emanuel for planting the ideological seeds from which UnitedHealth\u2019s kudzu conquered the health system. \u201cBut if most Americans knew that value-based care is just a fancy word for \u2018rationing\u2019 they\u2019d never stand for it.\u201d",

Non-Medicare admissions increased by 10.7% year over year, contributing to the company\u2019s total admission growth of 1.8%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur home health team achieved total admissions growth even while replacing United Healthcare (UHC) volumes for much of the fourth quarter and managing through the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton,\u201d she said.\n\nJacobsmeyer speculated that if UHC volumes had remained flat and there had been no hurricanes, growth in admissions would have been 5.4%, which would have aligned with the second and third quarters.\n\nEnhabit Home Health & Hospice is nationally operated across 34 states with over 10,000 employees. The company\u2019s footprint includes 255 home health locations and 115 hospice locations.\n\nCost saving strategies\n\nEnhabit famously parted ways with several Medicare Advantage (MA) payers in 2024, including UHC. After nine months of unsuccessful negotiations, Enhabit submitted a termination notice to the insurance giant on Aug. 1, 2024, to dedicate clinical resources to fee-for-service Medicare patients. The two companies reached a new home health agreement in December 2024.\n\n\u201cWe enter 2025 in a stronger position, with our new UHC contract in place alongside our other two fully ramped-up national contracts,\u201d Jacobsmeyer said. \u201cOur home health teams can once again be full-service providers for our referral sources. Our teams are motivated and reenergized by their ability to focus solely on admission and census growth.\u201d\n\nThis focus is reportedly already yielding results, as the company announced a census growth of 7.2% sequentially from January to February 2025.\n\nRegarding cost structure strategies, Enhabit announced its plans to close or consolidate several branches in the third quarter of 2024. In a follow-up, Jacobsmeyer stated that the company would now close five home health and two hospice branches while consolidating one home health and two hospice branches. The closing dates for branches vary by state due to notice requirements, but she expected that seven would be closed or consolidated by the end of the first quarter of 2025, with the remainder by the end of the second quarter.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the impact of these closures and consolidation will improve 2025 adjusted EBITDA by approximately $1 million or by an annualized rate of $1.5 million,\u201d she said.\n\nJacobsmeyer also stated that the company would outsource coding functions as an additional cost-saving measure. All branches would be transitioned by the end of the first quarter, and the company estimates $1.5 million in cost savings for the remainder of 2025.\n\nLooking forward to 2025\n\nCompany guidance for the full year 2025 is net service revenue between $1.05 billion and $1.08 million and adjusted EBITDA between $101 million and $107 million, reflecting growth of approximately 7% at the wide end of the range.\n\nEnhabit\u2019s CFO, Ryan Solomon, said that he believes the quarterly case for the company\u2019s full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance will show incremental, sequential improvement each quarter throughout 2025, with acceleration anticipated after the first quarter, during which the company expects 23% to 24% of full-year adjusted EBITDA to be realized.\n\n\u201cThe quarterly cadence outlined reflects the trough in our home health segment as we pivot from replacement to growth made throughout Q1 and following the signing of our national agreement in late Q4 2024,\u201d Solomon said on the earnings call.\n\nReferencing home health, Solomon said that 2024 was a foundational year to set the stage for consistent census growth while using the results of Enhabit\u2019s payer innovation strategy to differentiate the company in the market as a true full-service provider to its referral sources, allowing it to both grow and improve the mix.\n\nThe company\u2019s payer innovation strategy has reportedly continued to foster MA growth, with 48% of non-Medicare visits now in payer innovation contracts at improved rates. The strategy has also improved clinical capacity and increased favorable payer contracts. Enhabit has negotiated 76 new contracts and has a pipeline of 49 new contracting opportunities, with an additional 31 agreements being renegotiated, according to Solomon.\n\n\u201cThis, combined with continued staffing and cost disciplines, should allow us to expand home health margins as we exit 2025 despite CMS rate reimbursement increases not keeping pace with our overall market inflation,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Optum Rx, a pharmacy benefit manager owned by one of the country\u2019s largest insurance companies, UnitedHealth Group, has added a new, much-anticipated pain drug to some of its commercial formularies.\n\nSold as Journavx, the drug received U.S. approval in late January as a treatment for the short-lived \u201cacute\u201d pain typically felt after an operation or accident. Journavx works differently than other available medications, and its developer, the biotechnology juggernaut Vertex Pharmaceuticals, has positioned it as an important, non-opioid option for pain management.\n\nWhile doctors have welcomed this additional tool, and some analysts see it as a multibillion-dollar product, substantial commercial barriers could constrain patient access as well as sales. Cheap opioids have long dominated the pain drug market. At a list price of $31 a day, Journavx is many times more expensive than generic versions of drugs like hydrocodone.\n\nAhead of the drug\u2019s approval, Stuart Arbuckle, Vertex\u2019s chief operations officer, said price and access were the biggest issues stakeholders had raised in discussions on Journavx. Still, he said then that conversations with insurers were going well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged Optum has added Journavx to its formulary, reflecting the unmet need for new treatment options and the promise of Journavx in acute pain, and we continue to work with them and other payers to ensure broad availability,\u201d Heather Nichols, a Vertex spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nOptum\u2019s move, first reported by Bloomberg, appears to be the first significant, public update about Journavx coverage from a major commercial payer. Other healthcare giants, including CVS, Humana and Cigna, either declined or didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for updates on their coverage plans.\n\nThe team that crafts the list of prescription drugs that Optum covers is still evaluating the clinical data underpinning Journavx \u201cand will make a recommendation on formulary placement soon,\u201d according to Elizabeth Hoff, a spokesperson for Optum\u2019s pharmacy care services division.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, Journavx was added to our standard commercial formularies to allow immediate access to a non-opioid option for moderate-to-severe pain in the acute setting,\u201d Hoff added.\n\nOptum has, for now, put Journavx on \u201cTier 3\u201d of its formulary, which is designated for \u201chigher-cost brand name\u201d drugs along with some generics. Optum notes that using lower tier or \u201cpreferred medications\u201d can help lower out-of-pocket costs for patients.\n\nNot long before Journavx\u2019s approval, analysts at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald said they spoke to a senior director of product development at UnitedHealth Group. According to analyst Olivia Brayer, the director expected Journavx to receive broad coverage because insurers are under pressure to cover non-opioid pain medications.\n\nHe also did not anticipate Journavx having to go through \u201cstep therapy,\u201d a controversial practice in which patients must \u201cfail\u201d on cheaper drugs before an insurer agrees to cover pricier medicines.\n\nIn a note to clients, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger described UnitedHealth's initial coverage as \"encouraging.\"\n\n\"Bottom line: We are pleased to see a major PBM cover Journavx ahead of its launch for acute pain,\" Risinger wrote.\n\nMedicaid plans in two states \u2014 New York and Arkansas \u2014 have also put policies in place for Journavx.",

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the UNH options chain for the new April 25th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $470.00 strike price has a current bid of $20.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $470.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $449.65 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of UNH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $476.31/share today.\n\nBecause the $470.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.33% return on the cash commitment, or 31.63% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for UnitedHealth Group Inc, and highlighting in green where the $470.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $480.00 strike price has a current bid of $19.90. If an investor was to purchase shares of UNH stock at the current price level of $476.31/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $480.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.95% if the stock gets called away at the April 25th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if UNH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for UnitedHealth Group Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing UNH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $480.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $480.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.18% boost of extra return to the investor, or 30.52% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 34%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $476.31) to be 29%.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Inc., SAP SE and Toyota Motor Corp., as well as a micro-cap stock Better Choice Company Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\n\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. The company\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.\n\n\n\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $29.50-$30 band in 2025. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividend payments.\n\n\n\nHowever, declining membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. We expect medical costs to jump over 14% YoY in 2025. A debt-laden balance sheet induces an increase in interest expenses.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of SAP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+48% vs. +2.6%).

Continued strength in the Cloud ERP Suite sales is driving its cloud revenues.\n\n\n\nSteady growth in Cloud backlog at the end of 2024 is an encouraging development. By prioritizing Business AI and Joule development, the company targets to drive top-line expansion through 2027. Also, its healthy profit and cash flow statements position it for long-term growth.\n\n\n\nSAP\u2019s revised 2025 outlook succeeds the previous Ambition 2025 strategy. It now expects cloud and software sales in the \u20ac33.1-\u20ac33.6 billion band, up from the prior forecast of \u20ac29.83 billion at cc.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to UnitedHealth\u2019s CEO Andrew Witty demanding detailed information on the company\u2019s Medicare billing practices.\n\nJames Swoben filed the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuit. In 2017, the United States intervened and filed a lawsuit against UnitedHealth, alleging the company obtained inflated risk adjustment payments based on untruthful and inaccurate information about the health status of beneficiaries enrolled in its largest Medicare Advantage Plan, UHC of California.\n\nThe recommendation also advises denying the government\u2019s motion for partial summary adjudication.\n\nOn August 6, 2024, UnitedHealth filed a motion for summary judgment while the U.S. government sought partial summary judgment on whether materiality is an element of the FCA\u2019s reverse false claims provision. Both parties submitted a joint brief and supplemental memoranda in response to the court\u2019s directive for briefing procedures.\n\nScribd published a copy of the lawsuit online Tuesday.\n\nThe relator did not file a separate brief but participated in oral arguments.\n\nThe Special Master reviewed the submitted briefs, exhibits and arguments presented at a hearing on January 15, 2025.\n\nThe government\u2019s case hinged on claims that UnitedHealth failed to return federal funds to which it allegedly was not entitled.\n\nHowever, the Special Master concluded that the government lacked evidence for two essential elements of its FCA and related common law claims.\n\nThe motion notes the government\u2019s claims that United improperly kept money paid to provide healthcare for Medicare Advantage (MA) members. However, after years of litigation, the government has not reviewed any medical records \u2013 the only real evidence that could confirm whether United was overpaid. This failure weakens its case.\n\nAs a result, the Special Master recommended that the court grant UnitedHealth\u2019s motion for summary judgment and deny the government\u2019s motion.\n\nUnder Rule 53(f)(2), parties have 14 days from the report\u2019s issuance to file motions to adopt, modify or object to the recommendations.\n\nThe court\u2019s prior order from May 5, 2020, also clarifies that new evidence or arguments not presented to the Special Master will not be considered.\n\nThe recommendation, if adopted by the court, would mark a significant legal victory for UnitedHealth, potentially ending the government\u2019s case against the company.\n\nPrice Action: UNH stock is up 0.25% at $475.80 during the premarket session at the last check Wednesday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

The recommendation, which is to be presented to the federal judge handling the case, can be appealed within two weeks.\n\nThe civil fraud case against UnitedHealth Group, the nation\u2019s largest Medicare Advantage insurer, was filed in 2011 by whistleblower Benjamin Poehling, a former company employee. The DOJ took over the case in 2017. Medicare Advantage is the privately run alternative to the traditional Medicare program for seniors.\n\n\u201cAfter more than a decade of DOJ\u2019s wasteful and expensive challenge to our Medicare Advantage business, the Special Master concluded there was no evidence to support the DOJ\u2019s claims we were overpaid or that we did anything wrong,\u201d UnitedHealth spokesperson Heather Soule said in a statement.\n\nWyn Hornbuckle, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, said the agency wouldn\u2019t comment on the ruling, which was filed in federal court in Los Angeles. Attorneys for whistleblower Poehling had no comment.\n\nMedicare pays Advantage health plans higher rates to cover sicker patients but requires that their conditions be properly documented in medical records.\n\nThe DOJ alleges Medicare paid UnitedHealth Group more than $7.2 billion from 2009 through 2016 based on the company\u2019s efforts to boost revenue by reviewing patient records to find additional diagnoses and adding medical billing codes to their files. According to the DOJ, Medicare would have paid the company $2.1 billion less if it had deleted unsupported billing codes.\n\nThe Justice Department also alleged that in these chart reviews, the health insurance giant ignored overcharges that might have reduced bills.\n\nBut the special master, who was appointed by U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin, concluded the government\u2019s case \u201cdepends entirely on speculation and assumptions about what the codes found by the United coders actually mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this stands, I think it is a major defeat for the government,\u201d said William Hanagami, an attorney who represented a different whistleblower in one of the earliest cases alleging billing fraud by a Medicare Advantage insurance company. Hanagami said he expects the government to appeal the decision.\n\nSegal noted that UnitedHealth executives told Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services officials about its chart review policies at an April 2014 meeting. At the time, CMS was considering a regulation to restrict use of chart reviews, but the agency backed off the regulation under pressure from the insurance industry. At the time, a CMS official described the industry\u2019s response as an \u201cuproar.\u201d\n\nThe special master noted that United had requested the meeting with CMS officials, which she called \u201cthe opposite of concealment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem with the government\u2019s allegations is that the government knew of the very chart review practices which it now claims United prevented it from learning, and thus the government cannot have been duped into relying on any action or inaction by United in determining whether it had been the victim of overpayments,\u201d Segal wrote.\n\nSegal noted CMS audits of UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans had found that about 89% of billing codes were supported by patient medical records. The audit findings \u201cundercut\u201d the government\u2019s claim that the company engaged in widespread overbilling.\n\n\u201cThis litigation has been pending for more than a decade,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand the government has had ample opportunity to develop evidence in support of its theories. It has not.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes as UnitedHealth faces renewed investigations into its handling of Medicare Advantage coding, including a new Justice Department review.\n\nMedicare Advantage insurance plans have grown explosively in recent years and now enroll about 33 million members, more than half of people eligible for Medicare.\n\nThe industry has been the target of dozens of whistleblower lawsuits and government audits alleging that the plans cost taxpayers too much money, including a demand last month by Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that UnitedHealth explain its billing practices.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers dominate the market with large investments in leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. These investors have large capital and they like to invest in established companies rather than betting on underperformers.\n\nHow\u2019s the Stock Market Performing in 2025 So Far?\n\nThe S&P 500 index has reached its all-time highs, achieving returns of over 20% for the second consecutive year post-COVID. Billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett made a bold move in 2024, selling a record $134 billion of net stock. Buffett\u2019s move has raised concerns for investors and analysts. Historically, when Buffett\u2019s firm becomes a net seller, it\u2019s often followed by below-average market performance. Many believe that this could be a signal of stock market underperformance in 2025.\n\nThe stock market has already taken a hit in 2025 following the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. Almost $1 trillion was wiped away from the U.S. stock market in January 2025. Now, the market is reacting to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, as the U.S. initiates 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cTariffs increase the odds of a negative feedback loop in the economy. Nobody believed they would be implemented,\u201d said Dennis Debusschere, founder of 22V Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 has been underperforming its global peers in 2025 so far, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico all racing ahead. S&P 500 has slid nearly 1.90% year-to-date, as of March 4. Whereas, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index has dropped over 4% so far this year.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte, equity positioning dropped significantly in the week ended February 28, plunging back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump.\n\nBillionaire investor Leon Cooperman in an interview during the Squawk Box show on CNBC recently said that the president is on the right track, but he is doing things in a very destabilizing manner. The president is focusing on reducing the deficit, which is the right thing to do, Cooperman added.\n\nThe transition phase seems to have a much bigger impact on the broader market, coupled with the tariff policy. Ironsides Macroeconomics\u2019 Barry Knapp expects the Fed to cut a full percent this year, with the first cut projected in May. Knapp added that the economy needs to shift from government spending to capital spending for a better environment for business.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor the best stocks to invest in according to billionaires, we analyzed Insider Monkey\u2019s exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings. We selected the 30 best stocks to invest in based on the highest number of billionaire investors, updated as of Q4 2024. For the stocks with the same number of billionaire holdings, we have used the total value of billionaire holdings as a secondary metric to rank the stocks. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the aforementioned metrics.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNo. of Billionaire Investors: 23\n\nTotal Value of Billionaire Holdings: $8.14 Billion\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company. It has a strong economic moat, which stems from the cost advantage and network effects. UnitedHealth Group is a for-profit firm with four main segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx.\n\nOn February 19, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Sarah James reaffirmed a price target of $700 on UNH shares, maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock. The analyst sees a significant portion of its business tied to Medicaid, which assisted in generating over $400.28 billion in revenue in FY2024. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) has expanded Medicaid in 21 states out of the 27 states it operates in. The analyst sees Medicaid to perform well considering its potential market, encouraged by its strong business fundamentals.\n\nBretton Capital Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cWe invest in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) because we believe this revealed preference is real. The regulatory landscape changes constantly, there is plenty of noise in the system, and it is possible to imagine a world where health insurers would not be necessary. However, the massive healthcare system we\u2019re in today structurally relies on private companies to play the crucial role of managing care and negotiating prices, and we don\u2019t think the US government is prepared to take all that over. It was a bad year for our investment, as the stock returned a negative 2.4%, but it trades for a meaningful discount to the market despite consistently delivering double-digit earnings growth for years, including 10% last year.\u201d\n\nOverall UNH ranks 13th on our list of the best stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Seniors, Trump pick Dr. Oz wants to take you out of Medicare. Call your senator | Opinion\n\nSeniors: Who do you trust with your health care? If you\u2019re like me, you place a great deal of trust in Medicare, which you\u2019ve paid into for your entire working life. If you\u2019re like most Americans, you definitely don\u2019t trust corporations like UnitedHealth (UHC) to pay for the care you need, when you need it.\n\nDespite public opinion, President Donald Trump's administration is gearing up to hand even more of our Medicare over to insurers like UHC. They\u2019re planning to push hard for the \u201cMedicare Advantage\u201d (MA) program, which generates huge profits for insurers while punishing seniors with restrictions, surprise costs, and outright denials of care.\n\nRepublicans have a blueprint, Project 2025, which seeks to make MA the default enrollment option for Medicare beneficiaries, and a champion, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who supports an even more aggressive plan: Medicare Advantage for All.\n\nThe \u201cAdvantage\u201d program has been very kind to UHC over the years, boosting its profits into the billions. In 2024, UHC captured 29% of the MA market. It also captured the anger of everyday Americans trying to use their substandard insurance \u2212 as well as the scrutiny of Congress and the wrath of medical professionals who are denied the ability to care for their patients.\n\nI know this from personal experience, having recently consulted an orthopedic surgeon for knee pain. My doctor recommended trying an injection before jumping to surgery and explained the various options. I asked what he would recommend personally.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I recommend,\u201d he said, \u201conly what your insurance will authorize.\u201d When I told him I had traditional Medicare, not a corporate MA plan, his dejection changed to enthusiasm. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I can give you my best advice and administer the injection today.\u201d\n\nPatients and physicians suffer because of the roadblocks thrown up by firms like UHC: prior authorization requirements, restrictive provider networks, and frequent denials of care. These tactics bankrupt patients, lead to physical suffering, and fuel an epidemic of burnout among medical professionals.\n\nUnlike most doctors practicing in the U.S., Dr. Oz sees all this and applauds. He has consistently promoted MA plans, and even proposed putting all Americans into the program. For seniors, that would mean no more public Medicare, not even as an option for those who want it.\n\nDr. Oz isn\u2019t just a physician and TV personality, he is also an expert salesman. Whenever he peddles MA plans to vulnerable seniors, he highlights all of the supposed benefits (like extremely stingy dental coverage) and hides all of the many pitfalls.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t tell you that, unlike traditional Medicare, MA plans restrict you to a narrow network of medical providers. He doesn\u2019t tell you that many of these provider directories are ghost directories filled with inaccurate and outdated information. He doesn\u2019t tell you that more and more hospitals are dropping MA contracts, leaving enrollees to either change plans or change hospitals, even in the middle of a serious health event like cancer treatment. He doesn\u2019t tell you that the treatment your doctor recommends could be delayed or denied, sometimes by AI-assisted programs devoid of any human input.\n\nDr. Oz also doesn\u2019t tell you that, at last reporting, he held $550,000 worth of UHC stock. Which should come as no surprise, because profit is the primary motivator for MA corporations, and for their most ardent supporters.\n\nIt\u2019s time we reversed course on this corporate giveaway of Medicare. I urge you to connect the dots, and to encourage Sen. Marsha Blackburn, who sits on the Finance Committee tasked with Dr. Oz\u2019s confirmation hearing, to vote \u201cno.\u201d\n\nDr. Carol Paris is a health care activist who currently serves as vice president of Physicians for a National Health Program.

Your Email Address Sign Up\n\nMedicare pays Advantage health plans higher rates to cover sicker patients but requires that their conditions be properly documented in medical records.\n\nThe DOJ alleges Medicare paid UnitedHealth Group more than $7.2 billion from 2009 through 2016 based on the company\u2019s efforts to boost revenue by reviewing patient records to find additional diagnoses and adding medical billing codes to their files. According to the DOJ, Medicare would have paid the company $2.1 billion less if it had deleted unsupported billing codes.\n\nThe Justice Department also alleged that in these chart reviews, the health insurance giant ignored overcharges that might have reduced bills.\n\nBut the special master, who was appointed by U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin, concluded the government\u2019s case \u201cdepends entirely on speculation and assumptions about what the codes found by the United coders actually mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this stands, I think it is a major defeat for the government,\u201d said William Hanagami, an attorney who represented a different whistleblower in one of the earliest cases alleging billing fraud by a Medicare Advantage insurance company. Hanagami said he expects the government to appeal the decision.\n\nSegal noted that UnitedHealth executives told Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services officials about its chart review policies at an April 2014 meeting. At the time, CMS was considering a regulation to restrict use of chart reviews, but the agency backed off the regulation under pressure from the insurance industry. At the time, a CMS official described the industry\u2019s response as an \u201cuproar.\u201d\n\nThe special master noted that United had requested the meeting with CMS officials, which she called \u201cthe opposite of concealment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem with the government\u2019s allegations is that the government knew of the very chart review practices which it now claims United prevented it from learning, and thus the government cannot have been duped into relying on any action or inaction by United in determining whether it had been the victim of overpayments,\u201d Segal wrote.\n\nSegal noted CMS audits of UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans had found that about 89% of billing codes were supported by patient medical records. The audit findings \u201cundercut\u201d the government\u2019s claim that the company engaged in widespread overbilling.\n\n\u201cThis litigation has been pending for more than a decade,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand the government has had ample opportunity to develop evidence in support of its theories. It has not.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes as UnitedHealth faces renewed investigations into its handling of Medicare Advantage coding, including a new Justice Department review.\n\nMedicare Advantage insurance plans have grown explosively in recent years and now enroll about 33 million members, more than half of people eligible for Medicare.\n\nThe industry has been the target of dozens of whistleblower lawsuits and government audits alleging that the plans cost taxpayers too much money, including a demand last month by Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that UnitedHealth explain its billing practices.",

With Q4 behind us, let\u2019s have a look at UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and its peers.\n\nUpfront premiums collected by health insurers lead to reliable revenue, but profitability ultimately depends on accurate risk assessments and the ability to control medical costs. Health insurers are also highly sensitive to regulatory changes and economic conditions such as unemployment. Going forward, the industry faces tailwinds from an aging population, increasing demand for personalized healthcare services, and advancements in data analytics to improve cost management. However, continued regulatory scrutiny on pricing practices, the potential for government-led reforms such as expanded public healthcare options, and inflation in medical costs could add volatility to margins. One big debate among investors is the long-term impact of AI and whether it will help underwriting, fraud detection, and claims processing or whether it may wade into ethical grey areas like reinforcing biases and widening disparities in medical care.\n\nThe 11 health insurance providers stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2.3% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.\n\nWeakest Q4: UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH)\n\nServing individuals, employers, and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) offers health insurance plans that cover medical, dental, and vision needs.\n\nUnitedHealth reported revenues of $100.8 billion, up 6.8% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.9%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with some shareholders anticipating a better outcome.\n\n\u201cThe people of UnitedHealth Group remain focused on making high-quality, affordable health care more available to more people while making the health system easier to navigate for patients and providers, positioning us well for growth in 2025,\u201d said Andrew Witty, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.\n\nUnitedHealth Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 14.2% since reporting and currently trades at $466.01.\n\nIs now the time to buy UnitedHealth?

Thompson was killed Dec. 4 on his way to an investor conference at the New York Hilton Hotel.\n\nOn the day of Thompson's death, Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz signed an order giving UnitedHealth, chairman Stephen J. Hemsley and Thompson until March 1, 2025 to respond to the complaint. UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty is also a defendant.\n\nThe California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in the United States, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. The class covers any owners of UnitedHealth Group shares between Sept. 22, 2021 and Feb. 27, 2024.\n\nPlaintiffs point to the acquisition of Change Healthcare, a deal valued at $13 billion, as the start of problems that UnitedHealth allegedly sought to cover up. Defendants ask the court to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to state a claim.\n\nChange for the better?\n\nChange operated a clearinghouse, processing health insurance claims and moving data from entity to entity. According to a UnitedHealth estimate, more than half of American medical insurance claims \u201cpass through (or touch)\u201d Change\u2019s systems.\n\nOn Feb. 24, 2022, the Department of Justice sued to block the Change acquisition on antitrust grounds, arguing UnitedHealth would gain access to sensitive data that it could wield against its competitors. UnitedHealth prevailed and the Change acquisition was finalized.\n\nThroughout the dispute, UnitedHealth executives insisted that the company had \u201cinternal firewalls that prevent the sharing of competitively sensitive information across business units,\u201d plaintiffs say.\n\nShares soared from about $350 per share when the Change acquisition was announced to more than $500 per share in February 2024, when Change networks fell victim to a systemwide cyberattack.\n\nUnitedHealth executives were already keeping secrets from investors, plaintiffs allege. On Oct. 10, 2023, UnitedHealth received notice that the DOJ had launched a \u201cnon-public antitrust investigation into the company,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\n\u201cConcealing this material information from investors and the public, UnitedHealth chairman Stephen J. Hemsley and several other senior executives immediately took action \u2013 selling more than $100 million of their own UnitedHealth stock at artificially inflated prices as the market and other investors remained unaware of the new federal antitrust investigation,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal exposed the investigation in a Feb. 27, 2024 article, the price of UnitedHealth stock declined over $27 per share, falling from $525.32 per share on Feb. 26, 2024 to $498.28 on Feb. 28, 2024, the lawsuit notes.\n\nOn the offensive\n\nIn its reply filed Friday, UnitedHealth opened by taking on the Wall Street Journal article.\n\n\"The article did not claim that UHG had done anything wrong and, a year later, the DOJ has\n\ntaken no public action in connection with this purported investigation. Nonetheless, a\n\nmodest stock price decrease followed,\" the motion reads.\n\nPlaintiffs fail to show \"loss causation,\" UnitedHealth attorneys say. Their complaint alleges misstatements about UHG\u2019s internal data firewalls and its HouseCalls program for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, their motion notes.\n\n\"Plaintiff puts forward no allegations to connect what it says are UHG\u2019s alleged misstatements to the purportedly 'corrective' WSJ article about an antitrust investigation,\" the motion says.\n\nLikewise, plaintiffs cannot prove any false statements, insider trading or any of the other bad faith claims, UHG attorneys say in a 51-page motion.\n\n\"The Complaint is rife with legally inadequate 'must-haveknown' allegations based only on status or the nature of the subject matter,\" the motion says. \"Further, Plaintiff\u2019s theory that the Individual Defendants made 'suspicious' stock sales misreads the record\u2014one that, for instance, shows they increased their stock holdings, which is the opposite of selling to profit from alleged fraud.\"\n\n\u00a9 Entire contents copyright 2025 by InsuranceNewsNet.com Inc.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into UnitedHealth Group Inc's (NYSE:UNH) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-03-03, UnitedHealth Group Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $736.04. It's currently trading at a price of $474.96. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 35.47%. The company is significantly undervalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. UnitedHealth Group Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $27.67 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.25%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 17.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 385.42 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 350.62 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 736.04\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $504.70. This valuation indicates that the UnitedHealth Group Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 5.89%.

Just seven blocks over and five blocks up from where the shell casings hit the sidewalk, they gathered for gaiety in a glitzy ballroom.\n\nThe occasion was the 2025 PRWeek Healthcare Awards, a celebration of the sector that crafts the public\u2019s perception of pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, health care insurers and care providers\u2014through advertising, lobbying, corporate outreach, and so much more. Cocktail attire, please.\n\nIt had not been the best year ever. There was, obviously, the public relations disaster of Thompson\u2019s murder. There was also the looming specter of an antagonistic new health secretary installed by Donald Trump. Corporate profits for insurance giants were high, sure, but not the highest. Drugmakers\u2019 stock prices had been flagging.\n\nNot to say there weren\u2019t standouts. Eli Lilly, the country\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company, reported $45 billion in revenue in 2024, a 32 percent increase over last year. The company\u2019s net income was up 102 percent since last year. Their profit margin leaped from 15 to 24 percent. Also, the company, along with strategic communications firm Porter Novelli, was shortlisted for an award: Best in Media Relations, for the launch of Kisunla, a new drug for Alzheimer\u2019s that costs patients $32,000 per year.\n\nThe insurance giant Cigna, on the other hand, had seen its net profit drop from more than $5 billion in 2023 to just $3.4 billion this year. But it, and its in-house team, were up for an award, too, in the category of Best in Mental Health and Well-Being, for a holistic health survey referred to as the company\u2019s new \u201cVitality Index.\u201d (The findings were not altogether rosy: \u201cAmericans report downward shifts in physical, emotional and financial dimensions of health,\u201d it stated. But also, \u201coptimism is increasing.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnitedHealth, meanwhile, brought in a record $400.3 billion in revenue in 2024, and notched a best-ever adjusted profit of over $25 billion, but incurred a lot of costs dealing with cyberattacks, which brought down the final haul. And then, as we all know, someone\u2014maybe a random twentysomething gunman with back pain, allegedly\u2014offed the company\u2019s CEO and then escaped the city without hassle, and a huge percentage of America said, Well, he\u2019s got a point. So that was really bad, especially as far as relating to the public goes. UnitedHealth was not nominated for an award. No one from the company appeared to be at the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI arrived at Gustavino\u2019s, the tony East Side venue, midway through the 6 p.m. cocktail hour. There were no menacing bodymen, no armed guards. \u201cI looked for that, too,\u201d said John Digles, of Ascent Strategy Group, nominated for Outstanding Agency Professional. \u201cAt J.P. Morgan in San Francisco\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, held in January, the largest and most consequential health care gathering of the year, whose title sponsor should tell you a thing or two about the priorities of the health care industry\u2014\u201cthere was heavy security.\u201d This time they didn\u2019t even check ID. \u201cWould you like champagne?\u201d I was asked right upon entry. Why, yes, I would.\n\nPublic relations\u2014advertising, communications, crisis response\u2014is an essential part of the American health care industry. Americans pay by far the most for health care of any country, have the most expensive prescription drugs, and, for all that, still have the worst health outcomes among high-income countries. When you\u2019re wringing billions of dollars in profits out of the sickly, you\u2019ve got to put some money into massaging public opinion. That\u2019s just smart business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the awards\u2019 own event page: \u201cHealthcare is an essential part of the PR economy, making up around 35 percent of large agency revenues. It spans pharmaceuticals, hospital systems, public health, medical devices, care providers, health technology, digital health and health equity.\u201d Of all the different types of PR\u2014and there are many\u2014health care is one of the \u201cbiggest, most dynamic, innovative and important.\u201d It provides \u201cinspiration everyone can learn from.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, the PR industry needs the health care industry. And the health care industry needs good PR.\n\nIn 2023, according to one Harris Poll survey, more than 70 percent of U.S. adults reported feeling that the health care system was failing to meet their needs in at least one way. Health care spending has continued its expensive skyward climb: In 2000, total health expenditures in America reached $1.4 trillion; by 2023 that amount had more than tripled to $4.9 trillion, easily outrunning inflation. (In 1970 it was $74 billion.) There are the age-old indignities of premiums and copays and costs seemingly all going up all the time. And then there are the endless new pain points for Americans\u2014the rejected claims, the surprise billing, the groveling for coverage in the face of capricious, error-plagued, and rejection-heavy A.I algorithms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps no coincidence that a 2021 study by AHIP, a health industry trade organization, found that 7 of the 10 biggest pharma companies spend more on advertising, marketing, and sales than they do on research and development. And here I was, swilling cocktails with the people who make it happen.\n\nAt a table near the bar, I spoke with Heather Schwanke, a marketing professional in client management. \u201cWas it that nearby?\u201d she responded, when I asked if she was concerned about returning to the place of the CEO hit. \u201cI was leaving a Starbucks this morning and I was like, I hope it\u2019s not this one.\u201d I asked her what she thought the general mood of the industry was. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky time,\u201d she told me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not just because of the killing and the subsequent lionization of Luigi Mangione, the man charged with\u2014not convicted of!\u2014having done it. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was recently confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services, is not just hostile to the health industry, but has pledged to banish big pharma from television advertising. Despite the fact that he is a conspiracy theorist, swollen with bad ideas, this particular stance\u2014that big pharma shouldn\u2019t advertise\u2014could be good for consumers. According to the New York Times, pharma firms tend to make five times as much in sales as they spend on those commercials. But research has also found that the majority of the most advertised drugs between 2015 and 2021 offered little to no medical benefit compared to existing treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA person could maybe argue that it\u2019s good for Americans to know what drugs are available and on the market. But the United States and New Zealand are the only countries of the 193 recognized by the U.N. that have not functionally made drug advertisements illegal. Pharmaceutical ads tend to overstate benefits and downplay side effects and costs, encouraging vulnerable people to diagnose themselves and ask their doctors for pricey, sometimes unnecessary meds. In general, companies actually spend more money on advertising drugs that are less effective in clinical studies; according to recent research from Johns Hopkins, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for every 1.5 percent increase in ad spending, there\u2019s a 10 percent increase in sales. In laymen\u2019s terms: The advertising works selling some drugs that don\u2019t. Meanwhile, what few regulations exist are now being gamed by telehealth startups who hawk their meds online. It\u2019s happening in everything from ADHD medication to psoriasis treatment, all of which can lead to overprescription, which is great for profits but not so great for health outcomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlready, Schwanke told me, firms like hers were scrambling to provide guidance and reassurance to their clients about ways to circumvent possible future restrictions on advertising, including relying more on \u201cbroadcast news stories.\u201d If RFK Jr. was successful in his quest to banish pharma ads on TV, \u201cthat would be a huge change,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut we can still get the message out for your drug.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sharply dressed queue of people lined up for red-carpet photos in front of a step-and-repeat banner emblazoned with logos of corporate sponsors. Guests snacked on canap\u00e9s and hors d\u2019oeuvres before proceeding upstairs for the main course. A battalion of waiters fanned out with salads and filled glasses with wine. The awards were announced while we dined.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s entrants meet the moment and create real change, giving a voice to those who need a platform,\u201d boomed the program\u2019s emcee from the lectern. \u201cYou are setting the bar for what health care communications can achieve.\u201d\n\nGenentech, owned by Roche, the world\u2019s sixth-largest pharma company, kicked things off with a big win in \u201cBest Content.\u201d The standout campaign, produced by the advertising firm Syneos Health, was a feel-good musical combatting ableism called Most Likely Not To, which had cast actors with spinal muscular atrophy in a comedy-slash-romance centered on a high school reunion. The story focuses on the long-thwarted love connection between a nondisabled male actor and the wheelchair-using female lead. In the end, they kiss. Song and dance ensue and Genentech sells a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllegra, owned by pharma giant Sanofi, and Edelman, the world\u2019s largest independent PR firm, picked up the A.I. award, for a campaign called Allegra Airways. Artificial intelligence was used to test air quality in the area of Allegra takers in real time: If the air was thick with wildfire smoke, smog, or pollen where an Allegra user lived, there would be responsive price drop, a \u201cdynamic coupon mechanism,\u201d a not-so-distant cousin of \u201csurge pricing.\u201d (Allegra for all in our dystopian wasteland!) There was even a web-browser component, accessible on mobile, that could help Allegra users chart a path through streets with the cleanest air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main course came. (I had an eggplant-heavy vegetarian special). AstraZeneca won an award for Best in Corporate. The anti-ableism musical won again, this time for Best in Media Relations.\n\nCigna, the biggest and best-represented health insurer at the event, did not take home the award for Best in Mental Health for its \u201cVitality Index,\u201d even though that campaign had been paired with a million-dollar donation to certain Y locations, for teen and young adult programming\u2014and not a moment too soon: According to the index, \u201cGen Z adults continue to report the lowest levels of vitality, driven by poor mental health and stress about finances, and 83 percent report experiencing negative impacts of social media.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the honor went to Bristol Myers Squibb, which won for a campaign for the company\u2019s new schizophrenia drug, featuring the actor Taye Diggs. In the ad, he engages in a little carpentry while talking with his real sister, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. A clip of Diggs appearing on NBC News, in promotion of that promotion, was shown at the awards ceremony. \u201cWe need to change the conversation, because so many people see things on television that aren\u2019t necessarily true,\u201d he intoned gravely.\n\nColorful stage lights flashed on the terracotta tiles of Gustavino\u2019s vaulted ceilings. At my table, there was some grousing about the dinner, which was, if we\u2019re being honest, not very good.\n\nSanofi won an award for Best Public Affairs, for an ad campaign on Type 1 diabetes. Just two years ago, the company shelled out $3 billion to acquire a firm that specializes in Type 1 diabetes treatment, and a few months later found itself in federal court facing allegations it was acting as a \u201cmultifaceted monopolization scheme\u201d to keep insulin prices high. It also faced scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission. This year\u2019s PR effort\u2014don\u2019t call it a comeback!\u2014featured Usher and NFL insider Adam Schefter traipsing around Capitol Hill and making a visit to the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anti-ableism musical got another award. \u201cIt really was a great show,\u201d the woman seated next to me whispered.\n\nRelated From Slate Republican Lawmakers Are Debating Whether They Can Afford to Totally Gut Their New Base Read More\n\nDigles, of Ascent, was seated at my table; the Outstanding Agency Professional nominees were announced, and his headshot flashed on the projector screen, but he did not win. \u201cThere\u2019s a shift in public relations,\u201d he told me, when I asked what he thought about this challenging moment for the industry. \u201cFor health care, the shift in public opinion is significant. The trust factor is significantly different. We have to pass that test. Public trust has plummeted. Our business has to be more aggressive in addressing that. We have to go on podcasts like Rogan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe horrible thing that happened with UnitedHealthcare,\u201d he said, \u201cpainful as it is for us as a business, it\u2019s so important to listen and learn.\u201d That the public had turned against the sector so resolutely that alleged gunman Luigi Mangione still had a fandom of supporters camping out overnight just for a glimpse of his shackled, sockless ankles\u2014that his legal defense fund runneth over with donations, that the general discontentment with American health care seemed to have, in an instant, crossed over into white-hot violent rage. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d said Digles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA gelatinous dessert was disseminated. Some bolted for the door; others made a beeline for the open bar.\n\nI inched over to the Cigna table to chat. Here, I figured I would find the most poignant thoughts on the Luigi Problem; UnitedHealthcare is Cigna\u2019s peer and largest direct competitor, and was already off to a terrible 2025: Two weeks later the Department of Justice announced it was investigating the firm\u2019s billing practices. I sat down next to three women and two men who had lingered at the table. I introduced myself and asked if, given all that had happened\u2014and all that was to come, plus the location of the night\u2019s events\u2014they felt afraid.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s serious,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI would direct you to \u2018Let\u2019s Make it Better\u2019 on our website,\u201d one said.\n\n\u201cNo comment,\u201d said a third.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other undervalued wide moat stocks.\n\nAs per BlackRock, European equity gains have managed to outpace the US to start 2025. Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we used a screener and sifted through several media reports to choose companies having an economic moat and that analysts see upside to. Next, we filtered out the ones that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 28.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~36.5%\n\nForward P/E as of February 28: ~15.7x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the US. The company has a strong economic moat, which stems from the cost advantage and network effects. TD Cowen analyst Ryan Langston maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock, setting a price target of $609.00. The rating is backed by strategic initiatives and pricing strategies that are expected to fuel growth. Furthermore, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) managed to improve its operating cost ratio, mainly because of its strategic portfolio initiatives, which continues to act as a positive indicator for future profitability.\n\nThe company\u2019s diversified portfolio, spanning health insurance, healthcare services, and pharmacy benefits management, places it well for continued growth. The synergies between such segments enable UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) for cross-selling opportunities and integrated care delivery models. With healthcare evolving towards value-based care, the company\u2019s Optum segment remains well-positioned to capitalize on such a trend. Its strong Medicare Advantage growth and expanding presence in Medicaid markets can offer several avenues for revenue expansion and market share gains. Overall, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\u2019s strategy, which includes expansion of value-based care models and leveraging its scale and analytics capabilities to enhance its market share, is expected to fuel long-term growth.\n\nBretton Capital Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cWe invest in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) because we believe this revealed preference is real. The regulatory landscape changes constantly, there is plenty of noise in the system, and it is possible to imagine a world where health insurers would not be necessary. However, the massive healthcare system we\u2019re in today structurally relies on private companies to play the crucial role of managing care and negotiating prices, and we don\u2019t think the US government is prepared to take all that over. It was a bad year for our investment, as the stock returned a negative 2.4%, but it trades for a meaningful discount to the market despite consistently delivering double digit earnings growth for years, including 10% last year. First, the elephant in the room. On December 4, Brian Thompson, who ran UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance business, was assassinated in New York City. Shell casings had the words \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d written on them, a bullet was inscribed with \u201cdelay.\u201d Five days later, Luigi Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania with what appears to be the murder weapon and a manifesto criticizing the American healthcare system. Mangione has since become a cult celebrity. Healthcare is not a normal market. Governments have decided that healthcare is worth intervening in to achieve noneconomic outcomes, most notably providing care for people who can\u2019t afford it. Each country\u2019s regulatory system designs its system and rations healthcare in its own way: the UK employs providers directly and attempts a central triage function to allocate care; continental European systems typically have private providers but some version of all-payer rate setting; and the US has a decentralized model where providers can charge whatever they want, but payers can choose not to pay it, plus government-run systems like Medicare and Medicaid that cover about 35% of Americans. Every system implements some type of brake on costs, usually a combination of the government and private companies, and the US system leans more on the private sector for this than others. Our system is not without its benefits. It is vastly more lucrative for providers like surgeons and medical device companies. It also allows for some measure of money signal; if you are a rich weekend warrior with an orthopedic issue, the American system will offer a dizzying array of cutting-edge specialists where the UK would suggest getting used to the feeling of aging and stiffening one\u2019s upper lip. However, our system violates the social expectation of the word \u201cinsurance\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall UNH ranks 1st on our list of the undervalued wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Big Tech firms like Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft lead in shareholder value creation.\n\nStocks with a wide economic moat can be a good long-term investment.\n\nBut only Microsoft, Alphabet, and UnitedHealth Group are rated undervalued by Morningstar.\n\nPast performance does not guarantee future success; it's a line frequently used for investing advice. That's because stocks are a moving target amid shifting fundamentals, business cycles, interest rates, and inflation.\n\nBut that doesn't mean their historical strength can't be considered. If a company's stock has continued to rise, especially for over a decade, that sustained performance suggests it's doing something right. And it could be a good starting point to filter for good long-term investments or see if any common characteristics helped them succeed.\n\nAmy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at Morningstar, recently did just that by pulling a list of the top stocks that have created the most value for investors over the past decade. One common denominator among the vast majority of them is that they have wide economic moats, which means they are less likely to face competition in the next 20 years. This is especially important for companies spending mega dollars \u2014 like AI players \u2014 in hopes of reaping long-term benefits and wider market share. And to do that, they need a long runway with little competion to reap the returns of their capital expenditure for many years.\n\nShe also found that stocks able to create a lot of value over long periods of time tend to continue performing well for many years, which reinforces the approach of Warren Buffett, who once quipped that the ideal holding period is forever.\n\nIn this instance, Arnott measured value creation by looking at the biggest increases in market cap from 2015 through 2024, plus the value of dividends each company paid.\n\nThe list she pulled includes 15 sector-neutral names. Unsurprisingly, Big Tech, and more specifically Nvidia, tops the list as the stock that has returned the most value to shareholders, with more than $3 trillion in value created. It is followed by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom, all of which created more than $1 trillion in shareholder value.\n\nHowever, even if these names are well recognized, it doesn't mean it's a good time to buy shares. While there's a mixed bag of reasons a stock can fall out of favor, one of the central ones is simply that the share price already reflects the strength of the company.\n\nNonetheless, three names stand out for being rated four stars out of five, which means Morningstar considers them moderately undervalued or trading at slight discounts to their analysts' fair-value estimates.\n\nRelated stories\n\n3 stocks that are still discounted\n\nMicrosoft is one of the Big Tech players being pulled forward by its AI innovation, particularly its cloud computing platform Azure. While revenue growth is expected to slow for the giant, going from 15.7% in 2024 to 13.2% by 2026, the company's operating margin is expanding, from 44.6% in 2024 to 45.1% by 2026; it's a sign of continued profitability and efficient capital expenditure, a key gauge of successful expansion amid steep AI spending.\n\nIts fair value estimate, according to Morningstar, is $490 a share. As of Friday, it was trading near $391 a share, meaning it's still at a discount. Morningstar's senior analyst Dan Romanoff's conviction on the price target rides on expectations of growing profitability from its cloud computing platform Azure, its next-level offerings in Office 365 E5, and its Power Platform, which allows companies to develop websites and apps simply.\n\nAlphabet is another major player in the cloud computing space that's also spending big bucks on AI development. One hiccup the giant tech firm faces is capacity limits on its cloud platform, which has slowed revenue growth. However, Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst at Morningstar, expects capacity to widen which will pick growth back up. Meanwhile, he points to other areas of Google's strength, including revenue growth from its AI-driven search engine and its YouTube business.\n\nEven as the search engine giant's revenue is expected to slow, its operating margin is expected to expand slightly from 32.1% in 2024 to 32.3% by 2025. The analyst increased the stock's fair value estimate from $220 to $237 after it beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has had a bad few months. First, the shooting of its former CEO, Brian Thompson, in Midtown Manhattan sparked widespread backlash over the company's approach to insurance coverage. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported the company was under investigation for potential Medicare billing fraud.\n\nIts stock price has been volatile as investors try to gauge what to make of all the news. Still, Morningstar's senior analyst Julie Utterback believes the stock is undervalued at a fair value of $590 a share. On Friday, it was trading near $467. Utterback's note highlights that in 2024, the firm made 47% of its operating profits from medical insurance, but only 15% came from Medicare. Therefore, the probe over Medicare shouldn't be cause for a steep sell off, suggesting investors are overreacting. Additionally, the investigation could have a wide range of outcomes.\n\nHowever, investors who decide to take on exposure in healthcare stocks should be prepared for volatility and keep their ears at the door as Republicans release changes to healthcare coverage. Still, Utterback writes that the stock's price is discounted enough to buffer policy uncertainty.",

            "content": "Buying low to sell later when the stock's price is high is a time-honored investing strategy. With the benchmark S&P 500 index near its all-time high, though, now might seem like the wrong time to go looking for stocks that trade at bargain prices.\n\nIf a frothy market has kept you sidelined, I've got some good news. While most investors are focusing on the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, a couple of terrific businesses are flying under the radar.\n\nShares of Pfizer (PFE 0.47%), and UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.48%) have been beaten down to near 52-week lows. Here's why they look like terrific bargains right now.\n\n1. Pfizer\n\nShares of Pfizer are down by about 57% from a peak they reached in late 2021. Sales of COVID-19 products that declined faster than expected, plus upcoming patent cliffs for its top-selling products, have kept the stock under pressure.\n\nPfizer's stock price has declined over the years, but not its dividend payout. In January, Pfizer raised its quarterly dividend payout for the 16th year in a row. At recent prices, the stock offers a huge 6.6% dividend yield.\n\nIn 2024, sales of a next-generation blood thinner called Eliquis grew 9% to $7.4 billion for Pfizer. That works out to 11.6% of total revenue. Unfortunately, generic versions of Eliquis are expected to launch in the U.S. market beginning in 2028, which could reduce this huge revenue stream down to a tiny trickle.\n\nPatent cliffs are a problem for all big pharmaceutical companies. By reinvesting the profits that its aging blockbusters produce into an enormous development pipeline, Pfizer can offset the losses and continue growing its bottom line.\n\nPfizer has more than likely launched enough future blockbusters to offset upcoming Eliquis losses and continue pushing its big needle forward for at least another decade. In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nine new drugs from Pfizer's pipeline and last year was another big one. In 2024, the FDA granted more than a dozen approvals to Pfizer products.\n\nPfizer reported total revenue that rose by 7% last year. If we exclude declining sales of its COVID-19 products, total sales surged by 12% year over year. This year, management expects adjusted earnings to reach a range between $2.80 and $3.00 per share. That's a lot more than the company needs to meet a dividend obligation currently set at $1.72 annually. An upcoming patent cliff for Eliquis could limit growth, but not to a degree that makes it impossible to continue a steady pace of dividend payout raises.\n\n2. UnitedHealth Group\n\nShares of UnitedHealth Group are down by about 25% from a peak they reached last November. Unexpectedly high healthcare utilization rates hammered profits and the stock price lower this year.\n\nThe stock has been falling because medical costs rose 9% in 2024 but total revenue climbed just 6% over the same period. As a result, net income declined by a striking 35% last year to $15.51 per share.\n\nHospitals have raised pries a little faster than UnitedHealth Group expected,but this enormous healthcare conglomerate has levers it can pull to keep its bottom line moving in the right direction. For starters, it can raise premiums that members and plan sponsors and their employees will most likely accept. After years of consolidation in the insurance industry, options are limited.\n\nUnitedHealth Group doesn't just run America's largest private insurance operation, it's also the nation's largest employer of physicians. It's hard to imagine a better way for an insurer to retain more of the premiums it receives each month than by directly employing the physicians who order tests and procedures that drive up medical expenses.\n\nIn November of 2023, UnitedHealth's Optum Health division said it employed 90,000 American physicians, or roughly 10% of the total. At last November's investor day conference, management wasn't as vocal about how many physicians it employs but did mention it completed 16 million home health visits in 2024.\n\nUnitedHealth Group stock price is down but the company has raised its dividend payout a whopping 94% over the past five years. At recent prices it offers a minuscule 0.4% yield but it's growing so fast that this stock could be a significant source of passive income by the time you're ready to retire. Adding some shares to a diverse portfolio now to hold over the long run looks like the right move.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best stocks to invest in from Couch Potato portfolio.\n\nCouch Potato investing is the concept of having a portfolio of assets that operate almost entirely on autopilot. This portfolio is intended to withstand shifting market circumstances without needing investors to make major modifications to their asset allocation or objectives. In 1991, Scott Burns came up with the idea, seeking to construct the simplest investment strategy possible: a 50/50 combination of equities and bonds using only two funds. Burns claims that this makes it possibly the most accessible portfolio available, stating that anyone who \u201ccan divide by 2\u201d can understand it.\n\nBarclays calculated the weighted average returns of hedge fund portfolios by investor type, which ranged from 10% to 11%. Based on performance, a conventional 60/40 portfolio model would have comfortably outperformed these gains. According to the Lazy Portfolio ETF, a 60% stock/40% bond strategy incorporating the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the Total Bond Market Index Fund would have returned little less than 15% in 2024. Even after 5 years, including 2022, when both stocks and bonds fell in value, the 60/40 method has an average return of 8%. In essence, couch potato investing is a more conservative version of the 60/40 method. More importantly, its dependability shines through in difficult circumstances. For example, between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 sank 43.1%, whereas the couch potato portfolio declined just 6.3%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, one possible downside of the couch potato portfolio is that it tends to underperform during notable market upswings. Portfolios with a larger allocation to equities can better capitalize on bullish markets, resulting in higher returns than the more conservative couch potato strategy. This disparity is especially prominent when the proportion of shares in a portfolio exceeds the couch potato approach\u2019s balanced 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds. However, Burns recommends that investors evaluate this strategy comprehensively.",

            "content": "For years, whistleblowers, independent researchers, and journalists have warned about how Medicare Advantage (MA) plans manipulate risk scores to overcharge taxpayers. Now, a powerful Republican senator \u2014 one of the original champions of the program \u2014 is demanding answers.\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley\u2019s (R-Iowa) letter to UnitedHealth Group CEO Sir. Andrew Witty.\n\nOn Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a letter to UnitedHealth Group CEO Sir. Andrew Witty, calling out the company for its alleged role in widespread Medicare Advantage overbilling. Citing a recent Wall Street Journal investigation, Grassley\u2019s letter underscores what many of us have been shouting from the rooftops: Medicare Advantage is riddled with waste and abuse \u2014 and it\u2019s costing taxpayers billions.\n\nThe $8.7 Billion Question\n\nGrassley\u2019s letter references findings from a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare billing practices. At the center of the probe is UnitedHealth\u2019s use of in-home health risk assessments (HRAs) and chart reviews to justify additional diagnoses \u2014 often obscure, questionable, or outright inaccurate, according to the Journal\u2019s investigation into the company\u2019s business practices\u2014that increase Medicare payments to the company.\n\nAccording to the Journal, these tactics led to a staggering $8.7 billion in extra payments to UnitedHealth in 2021 alone. The Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS OIG) has also flagged UnitedHealth as the top beneficiary of these billing practices, raising questions about the legitimacy of these diagnoses and whether patients actually receive necessary follow-up care.\n\nA Republican Who Helped Create Medicare Advantage\n\nGrassley\u2019s inquiry is significant for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, he\u2019s no Medicare Advantage skeptic \u2014 he was instrumental in creating Medicare Part C, which later became the modern Medicare Advantage program. For years, he defended the private insurance industry\u2019s role in administering Medicare benefits, but now he is demanding information from the biggest Medicare Advantage insurer, and that represents an important shift in a Congress now fully controlled by Republicans.\n\nShare\n\nGrassley\u2019s letter demands that UnitedHealth turn over key documents, including internal audits, compliance reports, training manuals, and software data related to its diagnosis practices. He has set a March 10 deadline for the company to respond. Here are the questions and requests Grassley listed in his letter to Witty:\n\n1. What steps has UnitedHealth Group taken to review all diagnoses submitted to CMS for its Medicare Advantage enrollees (\u201cenrollees\u201d) that were identified only by HRAs or chart reviews (either manual or artificial intelligence) and to identify all submitted diagnoses that are obscure, irrelevant, or inaccurate? Quantify the number and amount of inappropriate payments identified as a result of these actions. Provide all records. 2. Provide all records that relate to the compliance program that UnitedHealth Group had in place from 2019-2024 to monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of the diagnosis codes submitted to CMS for enrollees, including the design and results of all audits conducted. 3. Provide all training manuals and guidance documents for conducting HRAs and manual chart reviews, a list of all software used during the course of an HRA and a manual chart review, and the logic rules for all electronic decision support tools embedded in the software. Does UnitedHealth Group use artificial intelligence to conduct the aforementioned processes? Are all diagnoses identified by artificial intelligence confirmed by a trained medical record reviewer? 4. Provide all policies and procedures for obtaining diagnostic confirmation from an enrollee\u2019s primary care provider and ensuring the receipt of treatment for a new diagnosis identified by an HRA or a chart review. Provide all documentation related to compliance audits of this process.\n\nSecond, his letter comes as the Republican-led Congress is seeking spending cuts. While many Republicans have traditionally been staunch defenders of Medicare Advantage, Grassley\u2019s willingness to scrutinize insurers\u2019 billing practices suggests a potential turning point. As Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.), a physician, bluntly put it: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing such abuse to the system that nobody really can turn a blind eye to this.\u201d\n\nThe Industry\u2019s Response\n\nUnitedHealth denies any wrongdoing. In a statement, the company claimed it welcomes the opportunity to share \u201cthe facts\u201d with Grassley and accused the Wall Street Journal of leading a \u201cmisinformation campaign.\u201d While the company insists that Medicare Advantage delivers better health outcomes and lower costs, those claims are getting harder to defend in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary.\n\nA Reckoning for Medicare Advantage?\n\nThe timing of Grassley\u2019s inquiry is crucial. As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently projected, just eliminating payments for diagnoses detected only through home visits could save taxpayers $124 billion over the next decade. With Republicans searching for ways to reduce government spending, Medicare Advantage\u2019s rampant overpayments may finally be getting the scrutiny they deserve.\n\nAs someone who once worked inside the health insurance industry, I\u2019ve seen how insurers game the system to boost profits. Grassley\u2019s willingness to take the industry leader to task is a major development and a sign that Medicare Advantage\u2019s free ride might be coming to an end.",

The DOJ also filed a lawsuit to block the UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion acquisition of Amedisys in November.\n\nThis week, the company faced two new investigations from federal lawmakers \u2014 the first being a senator\u2019s probe into its Medicare Advantage billing practices, and the second being a congressman\u2019s investigation into a decline in care quality at UnitedHealth-owned clinics in New York.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nThe first new probe came on Monday, when Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) initiated an inquiry into UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Medicare Advantage billing. He was prompted by reporting from The Wall Street Journal, which suggested the company may have manipulated billing rules for profit. The report stated the DOJ is investigating the company for inappropriately inflating its members\u2019 diagnosis codes to increase reimbursement payments.\n\nUnitedHealth accused The Wall Street Journal of spreading misinformation and denied any fraudulent activity. The company also denied that the DOJ launched an investigation into its Medicare Advantage billing practices.\n\nGrassley has requested detailed records from UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty, including compliance documents and training manuals, to assess the company\u2019s billing practices.\n\nThe next probe came on Wednesday, when Representative Pat Ryan (D-New York) launched a community inquiry into care quality at clinics owned by UnitedHealth subsidiary Optum. The probe, which targets Optum-owned clinics in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, comes as a result of constituent complaints about inaccessibility, inaccurate billing, and a reduction in care quality.\n\n\u201cMy office has been hearing from folks across the Hudson Valley about a decline in care, especially at CareMount Medical and Crystal Run Healthcare, following their purchase by Optum. I\u2019m launching this community inquiry to hear from as many folks as possible to directly inform my ongoing oversight,\u201d Ryan said in a statement.\n\nThe congressman is seeking more feedback from his constituents who receive care or work at Optum facilities in the Hudson Valley.\n\nOptum is looking forward to meeting with policymakers to discuss ways to achieve the \u201ccommon goal of providing the highest quality patient care,\u201d a company spokesperson wrote in an email to MedCity News.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince these practices chose to join Optum, we have introduced a number of new measures to continue to enhance our services, including dedicated teams responsible for scheduling and supporting medication refills and clinical questions, as well as technology investments to improve our patients\u2019 experiences. We, too, have felt the impact of the national healthcare provider shortage and are continuing to invest in solutions to attract, support and retain our dedicated care providers,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nPhoto: MikeyLPT, Getty Images\n\nNote: This article was updated February 28 to include commentary from Optum.",

Senator Grassley further demanded, in part, that UnitedHealth \"identify all submitted diagnoses that are obscure, irrelevant, or inaccurate[]\" and to \"[q]uantify the number and amount of inappropriate payments identified as a result of these actions.\"\n\nIn addition to the WSJ reporting, Senator Grassley referenced a previous October 2024 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (\"HHS OIG\") titled \"Medicare Advantage: Questionable Use of Health Risk Assessments Continues to Drive Up Payments to Plans by Billions.\" According to the Senator:\n\n\"HHS OIG found that UnitedHealth Group received more money from CMS for diagnoses only made during in-home HRAs and chart reviews than any other MAO [Medicare Advantage Organization].\"\n\n\"The OIG, which reviewed all MAO enrollees noted that, 'the lack of any other follow-up visits, procedures, tests, or supplies for these diagnoses\u2026raises concerns that either: (1) the diagnoses are inaccurate and thus the payments are improper or (2) enrollees did not receive needed care for serious conditions reported only on HRAs or HRA-linked chart reviews.'\"\n\n\"The apparent fraud , waste, and abuse at issue is simply unacceptable and harms not only Medicare beneficiaries, but also the American taxpayer.\"\n\n\"We are concerned that UnitedHealth may have misled investors about the legality of its Medicare Advantage practices and associated revenues,\" said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.\n\nIf you invested in UnitedHealth Group and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm's investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you'd like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the UnitedHealth Group investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding UnitedHealth Group should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAfter much suspense, the US Federal Reserve finally began cutting interest rates in late 2024, dropping the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in two cuts in September and November, with the market expecting further cuts this year. The Fed\u2019s decision came in reaction to falling US inflation and employment market statistics, which suggested that the elusive soft landing was still within reach. However, as February comes to a close, things appear to have changed. For the time being, the Federal Open Market Committee is projected to leave interest rates unchanged on March 19. That\u2019s because the labor market looks to be strong, and inflation is still over goal and slightly increasing. The FOMC\u2019s most recent meeting in January also said that \u201crespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed,\u201d implying that any reduction (if at all) will occur sometime later in 2025.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the 65-and-older population in the United States will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when it is expected to account for more than a quarter of the total population. The World Economic Forum further predicts that half of kids born in the United States in 2007 would survive to the age of 103. As such, wages seem to be falling behind inflation as people live longer lives. That\u2019s especially true now that businesses have moved the burden of retirement savings to employees, giving 401(k)s instead of pensions that promise a fixed income each month.\n\nOne dilemma many face as they approach retirement is how much money they will need to live comfortably when they stop working. According to Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the average retiree household in the United States spends around $5,000 per month. With a median 401(k) balance of $210,724 for those aged 60 to 69, implementing the 4% withdrawal rule yields around $702 per month\u2014which, when combined with the average monthly Social Security payment of $1,976, still falls short of meeting basic needs. According to Dan Doonan, executive director of the National Institute on Retirement Security, non-wealthy workers still have insufficient retirement coverage, forcing them to save on their own:\n\n\u201cIn general, we\u2019re just asking way too much of individuals to get all this right. And saving during the middle years of your life to provide income throughout retirement, it really is a challenging endeavor.\u201d\n\nConversely, Doonan believes that a more streamlined network of retirement schemes across the country can help private-sector companies reduce employee turnover. In addition, Congress has already taken its own steps, passing laws like the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, which alters federal retirement plan rules with the purpose of boosting access. According to Doonan, these revisions may encourage more employees to save in accounts similar to pensions.\n\nIn addition, retirees should monitor the equities market, which soared in 2023 and 2024, propelled by technology companies and optimism about AI-related advancements. According to FactSet statistics, the S&P 500 is predicted to expand by double digits this year, at a rate of 14.8%. This would outperform the trailing 10-year average of 8% profit growth. Furthermore, this strong performance may prove to be more significant than the Fed\u2019s interest rate forecast. Regarding this, Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston, said the following:\n\n\u201cWhile we anticipate 2025 is likely to be more volatile than the remarkably low volatility environment of 2024, the fundamentals remain supportive for both equities and fixed-income assets. And it\u2019s those fundamentals that matter more for the outlook than the exact number of cuts.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best retirement stocks, we used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to find large companies with low beta values, a history of reliable dividend payments, and well-established businesses. These equities were then rated using hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nBeta Value: 0.61\n\nDividend Yield: 1.80%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, is a major US multinational company that specializes in managed healthcare and insurance services. The company is a for-profit entity with four primary segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. UNH began paying yearly dividends back in 1990 and transitioned to quarterly distributions in 2010, with the dividend steadily growing since then. Last year, it returned more than $16 billion to stockholders in dividends and share repurchases.\n\nOn February 21, RBC Capital Markets maintained an Outperform rating on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) with a $655 price target. UnitedHealth Group\u2019s stock has been under examination since the release of an unsubstantiated report, which sparked a significant pre-market reaction among investors. Despite this, RBC Capital\u2019s analysts believe that the consequences of this investigation will take longer to emerge, comparable to the DOJ\u2019s antitrust investigation last year.\u2019\n\nBretton Fund stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe invest in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) because we believe this revealed preference is real. The regulatory landscape changes constantly, there is plenty of noise in the system, and it is possible to imagine a world where health insurers would not be necessary. However, the massive healthcare system we\u2019re in today structurally relies on private companies to play the crucial role of managing care and negotiating prices, and we don\u2019t think the US government is prepared to take all that over. It was a bad year for our investment, as the stock returned a negative 2.4%, but it trades for a meaningful discount to the market despite consistently delivering double digit earnings growth for years, including 10% last year. First, the elephant in the room. On December 4, Brian Thompson, who ran UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance business, was assassinated in New York City. Shell casings had the words \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d written on them, a bullet was inscribed with \u201cdelay.\u201d Five days later, Luigi Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania with what appears to be the murder weapon and a manifesto criticizing the American healthcare system. Mangione has since become a cult celebrity. Healthcare is not a normal market. Governments have decided that healthcare is worth intervening in to achieve noneconomic outcomes, most notably providing care for people who can\u2019t afford it. Each country\u2019s regulatory system designs its system and rations healthcare in its own way: the UK employs providers directly and attempts a central triage function to allocate care; continental European systems typically have private providers but some version of all-payer rate setting; and the US has a decentralized model where providers can charge whatever they want, but payers can choose not to pay it, plus government-run systems like Medicare and Medicaid that cover about 35% of Americans. Every system implements some type of brake on costs, usually a combination of the government and private companies, and the US system leans more on the private sector for this than others. Our system is not without its benefits. It is vastly more lucrative for providers like surgeons and medical device companies. It also allows for some measure of money signal; if you are a rich weekend warrior with an orthopedic issue, the American system will offer a dizzying array of cutting-edge specialists where the UK would suggest getting used to the feeling of aging and stiffening one\u2019s upper lip. However, our system violates the social expectation of the word \u201cinsurance\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, UNH ranks 1st on our list of best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Sign up for the Jacksonville Today newsletter.\n\nDr. Marvin Dewar has seen many things as an attorney and health care executive. But the CEO and chief medical officer for UF Health Physicians says has never witnessed negotiations with a health care company extend this long.\n\nSaturday marks the beginning of the seventh month that the UF Health system has been out-of-network with United Healthcare.\n\nJacksonville Today thanks our sponsors. Become one.\n\nThat means nearly 75,000 people in Gainesville, Jacksonville and Central Florida are paying substantially higher costs to access medical care if they are insured by United. UF Health Jacksonville provides services to about 26,000 United consumers.\n\nWhat separates UF Health and United?\n\nDewar says UF Health and United negotiators are closer to reaching an agreement for how the health care provider will be reimbursed for its Medicaid coverage. The biggest obstacle there is in whether UF will be repaid for the Medicaid coverage that was provided while United was out of network.\n\nMedicaid is the joint federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. In Florida, the Agency for Healthcare Administration oversees Medicaid coverage.\n\nIn January, Duval County had 222,897 people enrolled in Medicaid. At 22.2%, the percentage of residents who are on Medicaid is higher in Duval than in any other county where UF Health maintains a hospital.\n\nWhat may have a larger effect on Jaxsons is the conversation about private insurance.\n\nDewar says the latest United offer, provided in January, does not account for the rise in health care costs since the two parties signed their previous contract.\n\n\u201cI do think United has made progress so that they don\u2019t have us going backwards anymore,\u201d Dewar said. \u201cBut, we may have only moved a tenth of the way there in terms of closing that gap. \u2026 There is still a disconnect on the commercial side.\n\n\u201cWe still think that a lot of the opportunity \u2014 rather than think about it as United might want to think about it about the rate or the price \u2014 we still think the opportunity is to narrow the gap so that what we get paid is actually to whatever the contract says, so you don\u2019t have to make up for the 20 to 30% of the care that you provide that you\u2019re not getting (reimbursed) for.\u201d\n\nOn its web page about the negotiations, United says its priority is to swiftly finalize an agreement that is affordable.\n\n\u201cWe have met with UF Health more than a dozen times over the past few weeks, emphasizing our commitment to reaching an agreement that is affordable for both consumers and employers,\u201d United wrote in a statement to Jacksonville Today. \u201cOn January 10, we presented a proposal that included significant compromises. We are still awaiting a counterproposal and urge UF Health to share our sense of urgency in renewing our relationship to ensure Florida families have access to affordable care.\u201d\n\nUnited and UF Health officials met nine times during January\u2019s final fortnight.\n\nThe two parties remain apart.\n\nEffect of rising health care and insurance\n\nIn February, Strata Decision Technology, a Chicago-based data analytics firm, released results from a survey of 100 hospital financial leaders across America. It found the biggest concern for this year was maintaining financial stability. The Strata analysis found that financial flexibility would be obtained through the management of expenses \u2014 negotiation of rates with insurance payers as well as keeping track of labor costs.\n\n\u201cWith labor costs continuing to rise for hospitals and health systems nationwide, many organizations are looking to strike a balance between optimizing care and effectively managing workforce expenses,\u201d the Strata report found.\n\nIn 2023, KFF \u2014 formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation \u2014 polled more than 3,600 American adults with health insurance about their experience using their health insurance benefits. Though 81% had either \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u2019 thoughts about their coverage, the same survey found that 58% of insured adults experienced problems accessing their insurance over the previous year.\n\n\u201cSerious health and financial consequences arise as a direct result of insurance problems, and consumers whose problems include denied claims are far more likely to have needed care delayed or denied, to experience a decline in health status, and to face higher out-of-pocket costs,\u201d the KFF report found.\n\nIn October, a month after the end of the hospital-insurer agreement with United, Dewar emphasized, how United was an industry leader in health care denials from hospital systems.\n\nAt that time, Dewar said the consistent denial of UF Health claims was one of the biggest impediments to reaching an agreement.\n\n\u201cUnited leads the health insurance industry \u2014 this is leading from behind,\u201d Dewar told Jacksonville Today last fall. \u201cThey lead with denials about a third of the claims that come in, which is a staggering figure that creates a lot of work to get those denials overturned. Sometimes, you get them overturned. But, at the very least, it delays your payment and it costs you to have to go get those paid.\u201d\n\n\u2018Defend,\u2019 Depose,\u2019 \u2018Deny\u2019\n\nSince the impasse began, United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson was killed in New York City while walking to an investor\u2019s conference.\n\nThompson\u2019s death shocked some and delighted others. Reportedly, the bullets that felled Thompson had the words, \u201cdefend,\u201d \u201cdepose\u201d and \u201cdeny\u201d written on them.\n\nUF Health officials were mortified.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tragedy and should not have happened,\u201d Dewar said earlier this year. \u201cAnd no one should try to create a justification for anything like that to an individual who was somebody\u2019s father, somebody\u2019s son and somebody\u2019s spouse.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s death Dec. 4 led to a national conversation about insurance claims denials in the health care industry.\n\nDays later, United responded with a fact sheet about its claims approval rate. The company professed that it approves and pays 90% of its claims and those that it does not are due to administrative errors that can be corrected.\n\nDewar says that is not the case with UF Health. He says United denies between 20% and 30% of the claims the health care system files with the insurance company.\n\n\u201cWe are not relishing the position of being out of network,\u201d Dewar said. \u201cBut, we still have to have that gap closed on the commercial side. As soon as Unted can come forward with some real way of closing that gap \u2014 whether its by increasing the (reimbursement) rates or tangibly doing things (different), they could do it either way. There are multiple ways to close the gap. We just have to have that gap closed.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they do, we\u2019ll be back in network.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: United Healthcare is the health insurance provider for WJCT Public Media, the parent organization of Jacksonville Today.",

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has sent a letter to UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty demanding information on the company's Medicare Advantage billing practices.\n\nGrassley wants answers no later than March 10 on the steps UnitedHealth has taken to review all diagnoses submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for its Medicare Advantage enrollees that were identified only by health risk assessments or chart reviews, either manually or by AI, and to identify all submitted diagnoses that are \"obscure, irrelevant or inaccurate.\"\n\nGrassley is asking for the number and amount of inappropriate payments identified by these actions, and to provide all records. The records relate to the compliance program that UnitedHealth Group had in place from 2019-2024 to monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of the diagnosis codes submitted to CMS for enrollees, including the design and results of all audits conducted, the letter said.\n\nGrassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent the letter on Monday requesting these and other documents.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nGrassley's letter follows a report by The Wall Street Journal last week that the Department of Justice has launched an investigation into UnitedHealthcare's medical billing practices that allegedly gave its Medicare Advantage plans additional payments. The new civil fraud investigation is looking at how the company records diagnoses that allegedly trigger the extra payments.\n\nShares of UnitedHealth went lower upon the news. They fell 7% Friday, according to WSJ, wiping out more than $30 billion in market value.\n\nUnitedHealth has been accused in lawsuits of using AI to deny claims.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nGrassley said he has pressed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services since 2015 to recover improper payments made to Medicare Advantage Organizations, including UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\"Despite these oversight efforts, MAOs continue to defraud the American taxpayer, costing them billions of dollars a year,\" Grassley said.\n\n\n\nEmail the writer: SMorse@himss.org",

I don't know, I caught ChatGPT hallucinating like mad yesterday. No, look, Grok 3's okay.\" When asked whether AI could displace a substantive portion of jobs, he shared:\n\n\"Well look we always know why that it was a parochial view that Gensler took. Uh, Tim Massad over at the CFTC didn't take that view. He said it's going to be huge overseas because they got even less faith in their currencies than we have. And it's got a lot more portability than gold. Look I'm a huge believer in it. I don't know if I'm a believer in the big buck, but I am a believer in Bitcoin because I believe the thirty-six trillion, I don't know what to do with the thirty-six trillion in debt. I haven't figured that out yet, David. I thought when you spoke to Mnuchin, you would push the fifty-year bond that you know I'm a huge believer in.\"\n\nAnother hot topic that caught Cramer's attention was the SEC purportedly dropping its lawsuit against one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the US. He shared:\n\nWhen asked if he didn't have a problem with Musk splitting his between two companies \"No, I don't think that Dorsey, I did give him grief because it wasn't clear that he was for everyone. This guy favors every. . . .look I, he is remarkable. I just don't want him to show up here.\" He added: \"Look what do you do, when it says, Elon Musk on line two? What do you do?\"\n\nIn his recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer shared his thoughts about Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk's role in the government, and its impact on his companies. Commenting on industry concerns about his government efficiency initiatives impacting his companies, Cramer shared that his car, AI, and rocket companies have \"seen valuations soar in recent months. So, again, the complainers, they really have to re-think their view.\" Musk \"is creating wealth,\" Cramer believes as he added that \"he's [Musk] changing the government. Cramer then wondered \"is he President Musk?\" and asked, \"Who is The Apprentice?\"\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses These 12 Stocks, Elon Musk & President Trump . In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I do think that there are few employees in areas that are drone-like, but there are more employees in areas that really matter. I know Salesforce, really interesting that they're talking about, you know lack of code. But they are putting people in a much more substantive position. I think banks will do that too.\"\n\nReturning to Musk's DOGE, he shared:\n\n\"Uh, okay so there's this piece in The Atlantic. 'This Is What Happens When The DOGE Guys Take Over,' I want everyone to read this piece. Because what it is, is they come in and they take over your computer and they find out what's wrong. And it is devastating. Because they're going into companies and really, and they're going into agencies, and just taking over. It's a great article. It's heavily sourced. And one of the things that's really clear about it is they're winning. They're winning. They're finding things. And they tend to be in agencies so far which are, you know, I think of like the Consumer Financial Safety Board. They're in there heavily. They tend be on to agencies that frankly many people would say, Democrat agencies. Democrat agencies.\"\n\nAs for DOGE rapidly firing and re-hiring people, he commented: \"This thing is done so ad-hoc, uh, there is, there's almost no due process whatsoever. If you overwhelm the courts, and just make it so that they have to constantly take up these matters then, then DOGE wins. That seems to be the pattern. They can overwhelm the court system with all these different, if they just keep going after agency, after agency.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) the Best Retirement Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 150\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is the largest healthcare benefits management firm in the US. The tail end of 2024 was filled with turmoil for the firm as its shares ceded ground over the negative sentiment building against healthcare insurers in America. The negativity reached a feverish pitch in February when UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)'s shares dropped by 7% after a media report claimed that the DOJ would investigate the firm. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) claims that the report is 'misinformation.' Here's Cramer's take:\n\n\"Well look, I'll go over the math of what it does to UnitedHealth. This is gonna be one of those long battles, government may win, may not, stock's down as if, all the stocks are down as if this is the government really cracking down on them. I hate to say it because I think that there are a lot of people that feel that they, uh, that Medicare billing practices, if you read the article, are wrong. Carl, these companies, they're survivors. And, uh, you buy this uh, yeah you buy it because UnitedHealth is very powerful. I've often felt that UnitedHealth is every bit as powerful as the government. Because they are, strong, sprawling, and ready to fight. And the government has historically not been able to take on this group. They haven't really taken on the middle-man either. Look I mean we have strong corporations in our country and you know UnitedHealth is not going to have to, in the end, I am telling you that I do not think this is going to be significant to their earnings. That's what I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall UNH ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The report states that the company had increased its revenue from diagnoses made by Minneapolis-area doctors under its payroll.In a report last year, Then Wall Street Journal had alleged that UnitedHealth received an additional $8.7 billion in federal funds in 2021 for diagnoses that claimants were never treated for.The latest report led to a sharp fall in the stock price of UnitedHealth on Friday. Other health insurers were also caught up in the selloff.The investigation is significant as the Medicare Advantage plans cover about 33 million Americans, half of the people under the Medicare scheme. The Medicare Advantage plans are run by private insurers while the standard variant is handled by the government. The plan gets payments from the federal government every month based on the number of people they have enrolled. For patients who are expected to have greater expenses on healthcare, the payment is more.The US government has paid an estimated $462 billion to Medicare Advantage plans in just 2024. This amounts to over 1.5 percent of the US gross domestic product (GDP).The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises the US Congress on Medicare policy, estimated in early 2024 that the Advantage plans would be paid an extra $83 billion for the year than if the same patients were covered under traditional Medicare plans The health insurer has claimed that no new investigation is taking place as per its knowledge. It also stated that any suggestions of fraud by the company were \u201coutrageous and false.\u201dOn Senator Grassley\u2019s letter, the organisation said that it would welcome a chance \u201cto share the facts\u201d with him.It is a federal health insurance programme in the US for people aged 65 and older or those with disabilities.It covers 33 million Americans, half the number of people enrolled under Medicare.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 7 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nEnrollment in privatized Medicare coverage continued to grow at the outset of 2025, despite insurers cutting back benefits to improve the profitability of their plans.\n\nStill, year-over-year growth in the Medicare Advantage program appears to be slowing following open enrollment in the fall, according to a Healthcare Dive analysis of data released by the CMS on Tuesday.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, which operates the largest MA payer in the country, further solidified its grip on the market, growing its membership from 9.5 million to 9.9 million people. Humana, the second-largest MA payer, lost the most lives during open enrollment, falling from 6.2 million to 5.8 million enrollees.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe data provides the first peek at MA enrollment changes entering 2025 but isn\u2019t the final picture, as MA enrollees can still switch between plans until the end of March.\n\nStill, the release was highly anticipated after major MA insurers promised to shed members to resuscitate flagging margins last year.\n\nWorse benefits and fewer plans available is one explanation for MA\u2019s slow growth rate coming into 2025. Enrollment in the privatized Medicare plans increased 3.8% compared to 2024, a growth rate which, if it holds throughout the year, would be the lowest for MA since 2007, according to health policy firm KFF.\n\nIt would also continue the trend of decelerating expansion, as MA enrollment growth has slowed over the last five years. Market watchers say that MA penetration, which surpassed half of all Medicare enrollment last year, could be reaching critical mass.\n\nThe Biden administration was also a factor in MA\u2019s slowing growth. Prior to 2021, MA was growing at a rapid clip, thanks to a booming senior population, generous taxpayer funding and heavy insurer investments in marketing and benefits.\n\nThat growth translated to massive profits for insurers, which receive a per-member, per-month fee for covering their beneficiaries\u2019 health needs, but also contributed to MA costing taxpayers significantly more than traditional Medicare insurance.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a spate of rules to crack down on overpayments, including curbing reimbursement rates and making it more difficult for insurers to exaggerate the cost of covering their members\u2019 care. Then, in 2023, seniors began using more healthcare than insurers had planned for, causing insurers\u2019 costs to rise.\n\nIn 2024, operating profits for insurance divisions of the four largest publicly traded MA insurers \u2014 UnitedHealthcare, Humana, CVS and Elevance \u2014 fell significantly as a result of higher spending.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, a division of healthcare behemoth UnitedHealth, saw its operating income fall 5% year over year, while Elevance\u2019s was down 10%. Humana\u2019s plummeted 51%.\n\nMeanwhile, CVS\u2019 insurance business Aetna actually lost $984 million in 2024, compared to a profit of $3.9 billion in 2023.\n\nFacing investor alarm, insurers promised to cut coverage in unprofitable markets and reduce benefits to improve the margins of remaining plans, in a notable strategic turnaround from the growth-at-all-costs mentality that characterized the MA market in the past.\n\nTuesday\u2019s data from the CMS gives industry its clearest picture yet as to the impact of those reductions.\n\nUnitedHealth, Elevance and Cigna grew MA enrollment, while Humana, CVS, Centene and Molina discarded members MA enrollment for large-cap insurers, Dec 2024 versus Feb 2025\n\nMembership losses for Humana, CVS and Centene are in line with targets laid out by executives for the insurers, down 6.5%, 5.8% and 6.2%, respectively.\n\nHumana and CVS in particular were slammed by rising costs in MA last year, and adjusted their plans accordingly: Humana lost about 400,000 members over open enrollment, and expects that number to rise to 550,000 over the course of this year.\n\nMeanwhile, CVS, which lost 250,000 members, expects to lose \u201ca high single digit percentage\u201d in 2025 compared to 2024, CFO Tom Cowhey said in an earnings call earlier this month.\n\nAs for growers, Elevance\u2019s membership increased more than most other major MA insurers, at 11.8%. However, the insurer plans to shed some of those members this year, and expects MA enrollment growth over 2025 to be closer to 8%.\n\nUnitedHealthcare \u2014 already the largest MA insurer \u2014 increased its MA membership by 4%, or roughly 385,000 lives, versus the end of December.\n\nThat\u2019s in line with the payer\u2019s guidance: UnitedHealth executives have said the insurer plans to add up to 800,000 MA lives in 2025, with half of that coming from the enrollment period in the fall.\n\nDuring fourth-quarter earnings calls, executives for Elevance and UnitedHealth tried to reassure investors that the members they\u2019re adding are profitable, after some analysts raised concerns that more seniors than expected may have elected to join low-margin plans in the fall.\n\nUnitedHealth feels \u201cvery good\u201d about its membership, CEO Andrew Witty said, while Elevance feels \u201creally good,\u201d according to CEO Gail Boudreaux. Both insurers said they saw outsized growth in HMO products, which give them more visibility into spending on members\u2019 care.\n\nOverall, Cigna\u2019s growth rate of 18.6% topped the pack. However, the payer is selling its MA business to Chicago-based insurer HCSC, and expects that deal to close in the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe CMS released an initial version of the enrollment report on Jan. 15 before pulling the data, citing an unspecified issue.\n\nThe agency said it would re-release the files during the week of Jan. 20 but failed to amid a broader Trump administration pause on messaging from public health agencies.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH shares are on watch Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that Senator Chuck Grassley launched an inquiry into the company's Medicare billing practices.\n\nWhat To Know: Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to CEO Andrew Witty demanding details on how UnitedHealth adds diagnoses to Medicare patients\u2019 records. The letter cites Wall Street Journal reports that found UnitedHealth received billions in payments for conditions doctors hadn't treated. Medicare Advantage insurers get paid more when patients are diagnosed with certain illnesses.\n\nGrassley is asking for training manuals, audit results, compliance program details and software lists related to practices like in-home visits and chart reviews. The inquiry follows a Wall Street Journal report that the Justice Department is also investigating UnitedHealth's billing.\n\nUnitedHealth denies wrongdoing and calls fraud allegations \"outrageous and false.\" It says its Medicare Advantage plans lower costs and improve health outcomes.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are looking for ways to cut federal spending. Some lawmakers are targeting Medicare Advantage billing. Representative Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican and urologist, called UnitedHealth's practices \"immoral\" and said some payment arrangements should be outlawed.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, Trump's nominee to lead the Medicare agency, supports Medicare Advantage but has privately raised concerns about overpayments. Investors had expected a more favorable regulatory environment under Republicans but scrutiny of Medicare Advantage is increasing. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that stopping payments for diagnoses found only in home visits would save $124 billion over ten years.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is also investigating Medicare Advantage billing. Representative David Schweikert, an Arizona Republican, is leading a review of how the system pays insurers. He says the goal is to make insurers profit by improving patient health, not by adding diagnoses but admits changing the system will be politically difficult.\n\nUNH Price Action: UnitedHealth Group shares were roughly flat at $462.14 at time of writing, according to Benzinga pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage via Shutterstock.",

Senator Grassley further demanded, in part, that UnitedHealth \u201cidentify all submitted diagnoses that are obscure, irrelevant, or inaccurate[]\u201d and to \u201c[q]uantify the number and amount of inappropriate payments identified as a result of these actions.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the WSJ reporting, Senator Grassley referenced a previous October 2024 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (\u201cHHS OIG\u201d) titled \u201cMedicare Advantage: Questionable Use of Health Risk Assessments Continues to Drive Up Payments to Plans by Billions.\u201d According to the Senator:\n\n\u201cHHS OIG found that UnitedHealth Group received more money from CMS for diagnoses only made during in-home HRAs and chart reviews than any other MAO [Medicare Advantage Organization].\u201d\n\n\u201cThe OIG, which reviewed all MAO enrollees noted that, \u2018the lack of any other follow-up visits, procedures, tests, or supplies for these diagnoses\u2026raises concerns that either: (1) the diagnoses are inaccurate and thus the payments are improper or (2) enrollees did not receive needed care for serious conditions reported only on HRAs or HRA-linked chart reviews.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe apparent fraud, waste, and abuse at issue is simply unacceptable and harms not only Medicare beneficiaries, but also the American taxpayer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that UnitedHealth may have misled investors about the legality of its Medicare Advantage practices and associated revenues,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.\n\nIf you invested in UnitedHealth Group and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the UnitedHealth Group investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding UnitedHealth Group should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\n\nThe Fortune 500 list includes companies that generate the highest revenue in the United States. In total, Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the US GDP with $18.8 trillion in revenues, $1.7 trillion in profits, and $43 trillion in market value (as of March 28, 2024), and they employ approximately 31 million people worldwide. Large-cap stocks, which form most of the Fortune 500, are typically safer investments and offer relative stability in times of economic difficulty.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Performing Dow Stocks so Far in 2025\n\nAfter registering significant gains over the last two years, the broader US market fell sharply on Friday in the wake of weaker-than-expected economic reports and softening consumer demand. A recent report by S&P Global showed that business activity in the US is slowing down, with growth decelerating to a 17-month low. The slowdown is primarily a reflection of rising uncertainty about the business environment, especially in relation to federal government policies regarding domestic spending cuts and the constant threat of looming tariffs.\n\nThere are also serious concerns of high inflation due to the said tariffs, causing consumers to be more wary of their spending habits. According to the Tax Foundation, if the tariffs threatened by President Trump are actually imposed, it would amount to an average tax increase of more than $800 per US household in 2025. The tariffs on China alone will add $172 to the tax burden per household, while the rumored imposts on Canadian oil will drive up the price of gas, affecting the entire economy.\n\nThat said, some policy measures promised by the Trump administration can also bode well for US corporations and the overall business environment, including taking a less heavy-handed approach towards mergers than under President Biden\u2019s administration. Moreover, the cornerstone of Trump\u2019s second term will be to relax tax policies and extend or make permanent many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that expire at the end of 2025. The President has campaigned on further reducing the base corporate rate to 20%, with an additional cut to 15% for companies that produce goods on American soil.\n\nAnother important thing to be mindful of was recently highlighted by Bank of America in a note earlier this month, warning investors of the high concentration levels in the market, where a handful of firms command the lion\u2019s share of investments. This is partially because of passive investing, where investors shovel money into indexes indiscriminately. Passive funds now hold a higher percentage of the US stock market than active funds, which can distort market prices and severely mislead investors. To avoid a potential drawdown, the bank has advised its investors to diversify and consider investing in baskets of quality stocks with lower exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks.",

To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.65% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Currently, UnitedHealth Group is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, UnitedHealth Group is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 15.79. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.5.\n\nOne should further note that UNH currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.27. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Medical - HMOs industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.",

UnitedHealth has vehemently denied the reports.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal continues to report misinformation on the Medicare Advantage (MA) program,\" the company said in a prepared statement. \"We are not aware of the 'launch' of any 'new' activity as reported by the Journal.\"\n\nWe are aware, however, that the Journal has engaged in a year-long campaign to defend a legacy system that rewards volume over keeping patients healthy and addressing their underlying conditions. Any suggestion that our practices are fraudulent is outrageous and false\n\nA series of articles in the Journal last year alleged that Medicare paid UnitedHealth billions of dollars for questionable diagnoses. Attorneys with the Justice Department as recently as Jan. 31 interviewed medical providers named in the articles, the newspaper said.\n\nUnitedHealth denied that report as well.\n\n\"We are aware ... that the Journal has engaged in a year-long campaign to defend a legacy system that rewards volume over keeping patients healthy and addressing their underlying conditions. Any suggestion that our practices are fraudulent is outrageous and false,\" the company's statement continued.\n\nMedicare Advantage works more like an HMO than traditional health insurance. Instead of billing Medicare for every bandaid and splint, insurers are paid a lump sum to oversee enrollees' Medicare benefits. When patients have certain diagnoses, the payments go up, creating an incentive to diagnose more diseases.\n\nThe investigation comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of the insurance industry, triggering a Wall Street sell-off that also impacted rival insurers.\n\nDespite UnitedHealth's denials, the market reaction reflected broader investor anxiety over potential regulatory action against the Medicare Advantage sector.\n\nPressures mount\n\nIn addition to the DOJ investigation, UnitedHealth is already battling an antitrust lawsuit from the Justice Department, which aims to block its $3.3 billion acquisition of home health provider Amedisys.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the company\u2019s pharmacy benefit manager, OptumRx, is under regulatory scrutiny over its role in rising healthcare costs. Reports indicate that UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance division is also facing internal pressures, with buyouts and possible layoffs on the horizon.\n\nWall Street analysts are divided over the stock\u2019s dramatic drop. Some argue that the reaction is overblown, as Medicare Advantage constitutes only about 15% of UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance business. Others caution that ongoing legal uncertainties could weigh on the company\u2019s performance for months to come.\n\nMedicare Advantage under fire\n\nAt the heart of the DOJ probe is a broader concern about the Medicare Advantage system itself. Critics argue that insurers have long taken advantage of the program by adding extra diagnoses to justify higher payments from the government.\n\nReports suggest UnitedHealth encouraged physicians to document additional medical conditions, sometimes offering financial incentives for doing so. This practice has supposedly led to billions in additional federal payouts.\n\nIf the investigation gains momentum, the fallout could extend beyond UnitedHealth, prompting industry-wide reforms to Medicare billing practices. Investors are now grappling with whether this is a temporary regulatory challenge or the beginning of a fundamental shift in how insurers interact with Medicare.\n\nSign up below for The Daily Consumer, our newsletter on the latest consumer news, including recalls, scams, lawsuits and more.",

Sign up\n\nWhat UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has done perhaps better than any other company in American history is to buy companies \u2013 which, as mentioned, is something any company can do \u2013 and then integrate them into a cash-generating machine, which, as mentioned, is something few companies can do.\n\nTestimony to UnitedHealth Group's skill in integrating the companies it buys shows up on its bottom line. Specifically, since 2005 (the oldest year for which its financial performance figures are readily available), the company has never reported a loss. Quite the contrary. UnitedHealth has grown its earnings from $3 billion that year to $23.1 billion in 2023. This represents average earnings growth of 12.0% per year. First, very few companies have gone nearly 20 years without a loss, especially those who are acquisitive.\n\nSecond, almost nothing of value grows at 12% per year. The U.S. economy doesn't (about 3%). The Standard & Poor's Index doesn't (about 7.7% over the last 20 years). The Nasdaq Composite Index doesn't (about 10.9% over the last 20 years).\n\nBut UnitedHealth does.\n\nSince 2004, UnitedHealth has made approximately 17 major acquisitions of insurance, healthcare and healthcare technology companies. And these are the ones that are easily discoverable since they were disclosed in news releases. And the bar for issuing news releases is high.\n\nCompanies must disclose transactions that are considered \"material\" which is defined as greater than 5% of the issuer's assets. Since UnitedHealth's assets at the end of 2023 were $273 billion, this means any acquisitions smaller than $5.8 billion (5% of $273 billion) may not be generally known.\n\nThe things that can go wrong when one company acquires another range from the unexpected to the inane. Sometimes their technology proves incompatible. Sometimes integrating the operations takes orders of magnitude longer than imagined. Sometimes there are cultural clashes. Sometimes customers balk, then walk, at the changes that are imposed on them.\n\nWhatever the various sources of distress, they either retard earnings growth or they deliver losses. Slowing growth is bad news on Wall Street because the market is in the growth game. It's the single most important variable influencing stock values.\n\nThe only thing Wall Street likes less than slowing growth are losses. Some losses are more consequential than others. Losses predicted on software incompatibilities, or boardroom clashes, while not embraced, can still leave room for optimism of brighter days ahead. But a write-down of say, $99 billion, attributable to all the reasons above, and then some, which was taken just two years after AOL and Time Warner merged can be fatal for a company's future and investor's capital.\n\nEven a company whose overriding strategy is M&A can spook investors because the risks of integration are well known. And this is what puts UnitedHealth Group's performance in context, and helps explain a 400,000% return.\n\nNotably, UNH has suffered a precipitous decline of late, from about $550 to $467. That's the thing about the stocks in the 100,000% club. They don't just go up. They go down too. UNH went from a high of nearly $65 in 2005 to a low of $19 in early 2009, a stunning loss of two-thirds of its value. There are similar stories for Nvidia and Amazon. Over the long haul, UNH had risen more than 300,000% but for an investor to earn this, they needed conviction and lots of it.\n\nNote: This content first appeared in Louis Navellier's latest book, The Sacred Truths of Investing: Finding Growth Stocks that Will Make You Rich , which was published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

            "content": "Market Overview\n\nThe markets were closed on Monday in observance of President's Day. During the first half of the week, the S&P 500 reached a new record high of 6,147. This was driven by a strong resistance to selling interest and a tendency to buy during market weaknesses. However, by the end of the week, a consolidation trade emerged due to profit-taking activities. Concerns over valuations and a slowdown in momentum among top-performing stocks contributed to this trend, sparking discussions about a potential near-term market top. This sentiment reduced buying interest.\n\nEconomic Indicators and Growth Concerns\n\nThe preliminary February S&P Global US Services PMI fell below 50, indicating contraction.\n\nThe University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report for February decreased to 64.7.\n\nExisting home sales saw a 4.9% month-over-month decline in January.\n\nThese economic indicators, coupled with disappointing fiscal Q1 and full-year guidance from Walmart (WMT), contributed to increased selling interest later in the week.\n\nMarket Performance\n\nMega cap and small cap stocks experienced the most significant declines, while the broader market fared relatively better. The market-cap weighted S&P 500 fell by 1.7% from the previous Friday, while the equal-weighted S&P 500 saw a 0.7% decline. The Russell 2000 dropped by 3.7%, and the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) recorded a 2.7% decline.\n\nSector Performance\n\nThe S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector dropped by 4.3%.\n\nThe communication services sector decreased by 3.7%.\n\nDefensive sectors such as utilities (+1.4%), consumer staples (+0.9%), and health care (+1.1%) were among the week's top performers.\n\nTariffs and Market Sentiment\n\nMarket participants considered tariff discussions, viewing them as bargaining tools rather than permanent measures. President Trump announced a 25% auto tariff starting April 2 and mentioned potential tariffs for pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\n\nWeekly Index Performance\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: -2.5% for the week / +2.1% YTD\n\nS&P 500: -1.7% for the week / +2.2% YTD\n\nNasdaq Composite: -2.5% for the week / +1.1% YTD\n\nS&P Midcap 400: -3.0% for the week / -0.6% YTD\n\nRussell 2000: -3.7% for the week / -1.6% YTD\n\nTuesday's Market Activity\n\nTuesday was mostly uneventful until the final minutes of trading. The S&P 500 reached a new record high of 6,129 due to a late surge in buying interest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also closed slightly higher. The positive bias beneath the index surface acted as an upside catalyst, encouraging more buying towards the end of the day.\n\nTuesday's Economic Data\n\nFebruary Empire State Manufacturing Index: 5.7 (consensus -2.0), previous -12.6\n\nFebruary NAHB Housing Market Index: 42 (consensus 47), previous 47\n\nWednesday's Market Activity\n\nWednesday's session mirrored Tuesday's, with indices trading around prior closing levels before the S&P 500 hit another record high. Profit-taking activities were present, but resilience to selling interest turned into an upside catalyst by the session's end. Mega cap and semiconductor stocks played a key role in the index gains.\n\nWednesday's Economic Data\n\nJanuary housing starts: -9.8% month-over-month to 1.366 million (consensus 1.400 million), previous 1.515 million\n\nBuilding permits: +0.1% to 1.483 million (consensus 1.450 million), previous 1.482 million\n\nWeekly MBA Mortgage Index: -6.6%, Purchase Index: -5.9%, Refinance Index: -7.3%\n\nThursday's Market Activity\n\nThursday saw a negative bias following Wednesday's S&P 500 record high, with indices opening sharply lower due to consolidation and profit-taking. However, a steady recovery in the afternoon indicated a continued inclination to buy on weakness. Walmart (WMT) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 consumer staples sector, influenced by disappointing fiscal guidance.\n\nThursday's Economic Data\n\nWeekly Initial Claims: 219K (consensus 217K), previous revised to 214K\n\nWeekly Continuing Claims: 1.869 million, previous revised to 1.845 million\n\nFebruary Philadelphia Fed Index: 18.1 (consensus 20.5), previous 44.3\n\nJanuary Leading Indicators: -0.3% (consensus 0.0%), previous revised to 0.1%\n\nFriday's Market Activity\n\nFriday witnessed sharp declines in a broad-based retreat on high-volume options expiration day. Major indices closed near their lowest levels, with the S&P 500 ending just above its 50-day moving average at 6,010, down 1.7%. Concerns about growth and valuations fueled consolidation and profit-taking. UnitedHealth (UNH, Financial) shares fell following a Wall Street Journal report on a DOJ civil fraud investigation into its Medicare Advantage billing practices.\n\nGuru Stock Picks\n\nPrivate Capital has made the following transactions:\n\nReduce in AIOT by 0.69%\n\nRon Baron has made the following transactions:\n\nReduce in PRI by 3.3%\n\nAdd in RRR by 6.9%\n\nToday's News\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH, Financial) shares fell significantly following news of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the company's billing practices for Medicare Advantage. The probe, which includes the Office of Inspector General, scrutinizes potential fraudulent diagnoses that could lead to increased payments. Despite the company's denial of the allegations, the stock experienced its largest intraday drop since March 2020, although analysts from Oppenheimer and Mizuho suggest the financial impact may be minimal.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) announced that the shortage of its popular diabetes and weight loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, has ended. This update negatively impacted Hims & Hers Health (HIMS, Financial), which had been producing compounded versions of these medications during the shortage. With the supply constraints resolved, Hims & Hers will no longer be able to manufacture these compounded drugs, affecting its market position.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH, Financial) made headlines with its $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Lu, a move seen as strategically sound to enhance growth and scale in the energy drink market. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Celsius' position among female consumers, a demographic that has been increasingly consuming energy drinks.\n\nTrucking stocks, including Old Dominion (ODFL, Financial) and Saia (SAIA, Financial), faced pressure as J.P. Morgan warned of potential market share loss if Amazon (AMZN) enters the less-than-truckload sector as a competitor.

This follows previous reports of Eli Lilly's (LLY) potential interest in acquiring the obesity drug maker, which has seen its market cap rise to $3.5 billion.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) saw a modest gain amid speculation of takeover interest from companies like Procter & Gamble (PG) or Unilever (UL). The company is currently involved in a proxy battle with activist investor Starboard Value, which has pushed for changes to enhance the stock's performance.\n\nAMD (AMD) is reportedly in talks to sell server chip manufacturing plants in Asia, potentially valued at $4 billion.

            "content": "Update: A suspect was arrested and charged with murder on Monday, Dec. 9. Read more here.\n\nBrian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Wednesday, Dec. 4, outside the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, where the company was hosting an investor day.\n\nThompson, 50, was named CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, in April 2021. He first joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and had previously served as CEO of the company's government programs, including Medicare and retiree coverage, and community and state programs providing Medicaid and other types of coverage to millions of individuals.\n\nIn his most recent role as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was responsible for leading growth across the company's global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses, according to a 2021 company statement announcing his appointment.\n\nBrian Thompson, 50, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Dec. 4 outside the New York Hilton in Midtown Manhattan. / Credit: UnitedHealth Group\n\n\"Brian's experience, relationships and values make him especially well-suited to help UnitedHealthcare improve how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners, leading to continued and sustained long-term growth,\" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said at the time.\n\nA suspect in Thompson's murder, Luigi Mangione, was taken into custody on Dec. 9 and is now charged with murder. The 26-year-old is being held without bail in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and is expected to be extradited to New York City to face murder charges.\n\nThe Mangione family released a statement saying they are devastated and shocked by the news.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we cannot comment on news reports regarding Luigi Mangione. We only know what we have read in the media. Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest,\" the statement read. \"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved. We are devastated by this news.\"\n\nA low-key CEO\n\nThompson held other positions over his 20 years at UnitedHealthCare, including chief financial officer for the company's Employer and Individual, Community and State and Medicare and Retirement businesses. He also served as the financial controller for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business and was a director in the company's corporate development division.\n\nFor a top executive at a $562 billion company that affects how millions of Americans get health care, Thompson kept a relatively low profile. At an investor meeting last year, he outlined UnitedHealth's shift to \"value-based care,\" paying doctors and other caregivers to keep patients healthy, rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick.\n\n\"Health care should be easier for people,\" Thompson said at the time. \"We are cognizant of the challenges. But navigating a future through value-based care unlocks a situation where the \u2026 family doesn't have to make the decisions on their own.\"\n\nIn 2023, Thompson earned total compensation of $10.2 million, according to a disclosure by UnitedHealth Group.\n\nBefore joining UnitedHealth Group, Thompson worked as a certified public accountant at accounting firm PwC, according to his biography on networking site LinkedIn. Thompson graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and most recently resided in Maple Grove, Minnesota.\n\nFollowing the shooting, UnitedHealthcare canceled its Wednesday meeting with Wall Street analysts and investors, which Thompson had been scheduled to attend.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare,\" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. \"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him.\"\n\nOn LinkedIn, former colleagues described Thompson as an \"affable\" and \"popular\" leader.\n\n\"BT was whip-smart and affable \u2014 a guy who could grasp the complexities of health care and explain them in simple, relatable terms true to his Iowa upbringing,\" said Matt Burns, who served as vice president of communications at UnitedHealth Group from 2015 to 2018.\n\nThompson is survived by his wife, Paulette Thompson, and two sons.\n\n\"We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian,\" Thompson's wife said in a statement provided to CBS News by her sister. \"Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed. We appreciate your well wishes and request complete privacy as our family moves through this difficult time.\"\n\nMinnesota leaders express shock\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also weighed in on Thompson's death. \"This is a shocking and devastating loss for our whole community. 'Shocking' is the only word I can find at the moment,\" he said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nHe added in a post on social media that Thompson was \"a great man.\"\n\nMinnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar expressed her condolences for Thompson's family and for United Healthcare employees in the state, calling the shooting \"a horrifying and shocking act of violence\" in a post on X.\n\nIn his own post, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Thompson's death \"a terrible loss for the business and health care community in Minnesota.\"\n\nCorporate security\n\nThompson's killing is putting a spotlight on corporate security, including the monitoring of cyberthreats and physical protection for high-profile executives.\n\nThompson did not appear to have a bodyguard with him at the time of the shooting, but did have an in-house security team, according to a CNN report. By contrast, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, spend heavily to provide around-the-clock protection for their top executives. For example, Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, spent more than $24 million on security for its top executives last year, filings examined by research firm Equilar show.\n\nNew details on Luigi Mangione's time in prison, evidence probed\n\nWoman whose sentence was commuted by Biden tells her story\n\nAmerican Airlines flight forced to make emergency landing after likely bird strike",

UnitedHealth Group is the biggest health-care conglomerate in the U.S. based on revenue and its more than $420 billion market cap, and UnitedHealthcare is the nation's largest private insurer.\n\nShares of UnitedHealth Group have tumbled more than 20% over the last three months.\n\nThe stock also closed 7% lower on Friday following a report about the probe, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The Department of Justice has launched a civil fraud investigation in recent months into UnitedHealth's billing practices for its Medicare Advantage plans, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe probe specifically examines whether diagnoses were routinely made to trigger extra payments in those plans, including at physician groups the insurer owns, the Journal said. It comes after a series of articles from the newspaper last year, which reported that Medicare paid UnitedHealth billions of dollars for questionable diagnoses.\n\nMedicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurers who are paid a set rate by the government to manage health care for seniors looking for extra benefits not covered in traditional Medicare. Those plans have been a source of high medical costs across the broader insurance industry over the last year.\n\nIn a statement, UnitedHealth called the Journal's reporting \"misinformation\" and said the company consistently performs at the industry's \"highest levels\" when it comes to government compliance reviews of Medicare Advantage plans\n\n\"Any suggestion that our practices are fraudulent is outrageous and false,\" the company said.\n\nIn a research note Friday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Ben Hendrix called the reported investigation an \"incremental overhang\" but emphasized it will likely be a \"lengthy process and unlikely in our view to result in material financial headwinds in the near term.\" He pointed to a probe the DOJ launched last year into the company's subsidiary Optum Rx for potential antitrust violations, which will similarly have an extended timeline before any resolution.\n\nReports about the probe came two days after CNBC first reported that UnitedHealthcare is offering buyouts to employees and could pursue layoffs if resignation quotas aren't met. The move comes as the company tries to cut costs through efforts like leveraging digital technology.",

            "content": "About a year ago, UnitedHealth Group, the U.S. health-insurance giant, was targeted in one of the largest ransomware attacks ever. It had such far-reaching, severe consequences that new details about the attack and its aftermath have continued to emerge since the incident. To mark its anniversary, we\u2019ve compiled a summary of all the data available today.\n\nThe ransomware attack on UnitedHealth Group\n\nBefore we proceed, let\u2019s briefly introduce this organization to those unfamiliar with it. With a capitalization of approximately $500 billion, UnitedHealth Group is the largest company in the U.S. market for health insurance and healthcare services. It ranks ninth globally in terms of revenue \u2014 right after Apple.\n\nUnitedHealth Group comprises two companies. One of them, UnitedHealthcare, focuses on health insurance. The other, Optum, specializes in delivering a broad spectrum of healthcare services ranging from pharmaceuticals and direct medical care to the IT systems underlying healthcare operations.\n\nOptum Insight, one of Optum\u2019s three divisions (and the most profitable), handles the latter. In the fall of 2022, UnitedHealth Group acquired the Change Healthcare platform, and Optum Insight integrated it. This digital platform processes insurance claims \u2014 acting as a financial intermediary between patients, healthcare providers, and insurers.\n\nChange Healthcare was the target of the attack. On February 21, 2024, its systems were infected with ransomware \u2014 rendering the platform inaccessible. The incident wreaked havoc on the U.S. healthcare system, leaving many patients to shoulder the financial burden of medical expenses as insurance claims couldn\u2019t be processed quickly. Healthcare providers were forced to process bills manually.\n\nRecovering the compromised systems took several months. For instance, the Change Healthcare clearing service didn\u2019t resume full operations until November. UnitedHealth Group even set up a dedicated website to track the restoration efforts. Even now, a year after the attack, the company is still regularly publishing updates on the website, and some systems are still listed as only \u201cpartially available\u201d.\n\nTimeline of the attack on UnitedHealth Group\n\nA few months after the incident, on May 1, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty, was summoned to testify before Congress. From that testimony, the general public was finally able to learn about how the attack on the company unfolded.\n\nAccording to Witty, the attack began on February 12. The attackers used compromised credentials to gain access to the Change Healthcare Citrix portal, which was used for remote desktop connections. Two-factor authentication should have stopped them but\u2026 it wasn\u2019t enabled. Thus, attackers were able to gain entry simply by using the compromised credentials.\n\nAfter gaining initial access, they began to move laterally and harvest data. The attackers clearly managed to collect a substantial amount of valuable data within the following nine days. In any case, on February 21, they deployed ransomware \u2014 initiating the encryption of Change Healthcare\u2019s systems.\n\nFaced with this situation, UnitedHealth decided to disconnect Change Healthcare data centers from the network to contain the ransomware attack.\n\nWitty argued that the decision effectively prevented the infection from spreading to Optum, UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group, and any external organizations. However, the complete shutdown of a critical digital platform had a devastating impact on both UnitedHealth Group\u2019s business operations and the broader U.S. healthcare system as a whole.\n\nThus, the most extensive ransomware attack of 2024 was caused by the absence of two-factor authentication on a remote desktop access portal \u2014 precisely the place where it absolutely should have been enabled. As Oregon Senator, Ron Wyden, summarized, \u201cThis hack could have been stopped with cybersecurity 101\u201d.\n\nUnitedHealth Group pays up\n\nSeveral days after the breach, the BlackCat/ALPHV cybercrime gang claimed responsibility for it. The attackers claimed to have exfiltrated 6TB of confidential data \u2014 including medical records, financial documents, and personal information belonging to U.S. civilians and military personnel, among other sensitive information.\n\nIn March 2024, UnitedHealth Group paid a ransom of $22 million to the gang. But the story didn\u2019t end there: after receiving the ransom, ALPHV feigned having their infrastructure seized by the FBI again. This was likely a ploy to double-cross one of their associates \u2014 pocketing the funds and disappearing into the ether.\n\nSaid associate claimed ALPHV had failed to give them their cut, and later teamed up with another ransomware gang \u2014 RansomHub. That gang made some of the stolen data public in April 2024, and then tried to extort more money from UnitedHealth.\n\nIt remains unclear whether UnitedHealth ever paid the second ransom, as there was no official confirmation. However, the demand was later removed from RansomHub\u2019s website, and no further leaks of the stolen company data have been observed. Therefore, it can be assumed that the company did, in fact, pay twice. This is even more likely if one considers that the ransom amounts are dwarfed by the massive financial impact the attack had on UnitedHealth Group.\n\nThe aftermath of the ransomware attack on UnitedHealth Group\n\nUnitedHealth Group posted $872 million in losses associated with the cyberattack in Q1 2024 alone. The company also estimated in its Q1 report that the annual cost of the breach could reach $1.35 to $1.6 billion.\n\nThose initial estimates proved to be far too optimistic: predicted damage kept growing quarter after quarter, first increasing to $2.3 to $2.45 billion, and then to $2.87 billion.\n\nBy the end of the fiscal year, as reported by UnitedHealth Group in January 2025, the incident resulted in a total annual loss of $3.09 billion. Although the damage estimate for 2024 is now finalized, the total damage could still increase substantially as the company continues to deal with the consequences of the attack.\n\nAn official estimate of the number of individuals whose data could have been stolen by the cybercriminals took a long time to materialize. It was only eight months after the incident, on October 24, 2024, that UnitedHealth Group finally came up with a tally. It was a mind-boggling figure: 100 million, or nearly a third of the entire population of the United States.\n\nNevertheless, it would become evident that these estimations were as overly hopeful as the original predictions about the financial losses. Three months later, at the end of January 2025, UnitedHealth Group released an updated report that put the number of those impacted by the breach at 190 million.\n\nProtecting your company against ransomware\n\nClearly, the most obvious lesson to be learned from the UnitedHealth Group breach is that two-factor authentication is a must for any public-facing service. Otherwise, a single compromised password could cause massive problems and billions of dollars in losses.\n\nEssential as it is, two-factor authentication is by no means sufficient protection against ransomware. Defending corporate infrastructure from ransomware attacks must be multilayered. Here are some additional tips:",

This past year, we saw an extraordinary increase in the use of these modern channels.\"\n\nOther health insurance companies have also recently announced voluntary buyouts. Across the industry, health care companies are facing higher medical costs that cut into their profits.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, for example, is offering buyouts to its nonunion employees as the health insurer tries to cut $285 million in administrative expenses this year as claims \"skyrocket,\" according to a report in the Detroit Free Press.\n\nThe news of the UnitedHealthcare buyouts was first reported by CNBC.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group is attempting to swat down a non-binding shareholder proposal that asked the company to prepare reports on the costs of delayed and denied healthcare.\n\nThe proposal, filed by members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), represents a new frontier in seeking to hold insurance companies accountable for the \u201cmacroeconomic costs\u201d of denied care \u2013 arguing they eventually hurt the bottom line of large investors.\n\nThe proposal asks UnitedHealth Group to prepare reports on the \u201cpublic health-related costs and macroeconomic risks created by the company\u2019s practices that limit or delay access to healthcare\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe investors we work with are interested in long-term value creation,\u201d said Meg Jones-Monteiro, senior director of health equity at ICCR. The coalition represents primarily institutional investors, such as pensions and foundations.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the investment portfolios our members have, they are very diverse,\u201d Jones-Monteiro. \u201cWhat happens in one sector impacts another.\u201d\n\nThe proposal is non-binding, but UnitedHealth Group is nevertheless fighting to stop it. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in January, UnitedHealth Group attempted to exclude the proposal from proxy statements on technical grounds, arguing in part that the terms \u201cpublic-health related costs\u201d and \u201cmacroeconomic risks\u201d are vague and subject to interpretation.\n\nMembers of the coalition are seeking more \u201ctransparency\u201d so shareholders can understand the \u201cexternalities\u201d created by UnitedHealth Group \u2013 a behemoth by any measure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tracking shareholder proposals for many years,\u201d said Shirley Westcott, senior vice-president at Alliance Advisors in the corporate governance group. \u201cI have not seen anything like this before.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth Group is the 19th-largest company in the world by market capitalization, the largest US health insurer and the largest US employer of doctors. More than 5% of US gross domestic product flows through the company each day, according to one industry analysis.\n\nThe motion argues that the company is so large that care delays caused by prior authorizations, by which patients are required to ask their insurer for permission before a treatment, and denials could ultimately hurt the broader US economy by keeping workers sick and indebted.\n\n\u201cOverall performance of financial markets determines 75-94% of portfolio returns,\u201d investors argued in their proposal. \u201cGiven UHG\u2019s size and broad reach \u2026 shareholders fear UHG\u2019s practices may impair the value of their portfolios.\u201d\n\nEven if the SEC rules in favor of including the shareholder proposal, it may still be excluded from proxy statements if the company agrees to terms that satisfy the investors. Investors would then typically withdraw their proposal.\n\nThe motion comes after the murder of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, who was shot and killed before a company meeting in Manhattan in December. His killing sparked a national debate about healthcare, after many publicly responded to his death with apathy and derision.\n\nUnitedHealth Group did not respond to a request for comment.",

Americans pay more than ever for health insurance, even as insurers are rejecting more than 1 in 5 claims. Most adults in the U.S. say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, according to a 2024 KFF survey. The New York Police Department said that there is no indication Mangione was a client of the company, but officials believe UHC may have been targeted due to its status as the largest health insurer in the U.S.\n\nSince Thompson's murder, some have used social media to vent about their experiences with health insurance companies, and others have even celebrated Thompson's accused killer, Luigi Mangione. The shooting has thrust a new spotlight on the safety of executives and other high-ranking employees.\n\n\"Hunt for a CEO Killer\" special details search for suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting\n\n\"We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people's frustrations with it. No one would design a system like the one we have,\" Witty wrote. \"And no one did. It's a patchwork built over decades.\"\n\nWitty said that while UHC is willing to \"partner with anyone\" who could help the system work better, \"clearly, we are not there yet.\"\n\n\"We understand and share the desire to build a health care system that works better for everyone. That is the purpose of our organization,\" he wrote.\n\nWitty said that Thompson was among the people working in the health care industry who \"try to do their best for those they serve.\"\n\nThompson was raised in the same Iowa farmhouse as his mother, Witty wrote, and worked farm jobs as a child. That rural upbringing inspired his ethos as CEO, Witty said.\n\nBrian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare. / Credit: UnitedHealthcare\n\n\"He never forgot where he came from, because it was the needs of people who live in places like Jewell, Iowa, that he considered first in finding ways to improve care,\" Witty wrote. \"When a colleague proposed a new idea to Brian, he would always ask, 'Would you want this for your own family?' If not, end of discussion.\"\n\nWitty added that Thompson was \"never content with the status quo\" and praised the CEO for advocating for ideas that \"were aimed at making health care more affordable, more transparent, more intuitive, more compassionate \u2014 and more human.\"\n\n\"That's Brian's legacy, one that we will carry forward by continuing our work to make the health system work better for everyone,\" Witty wrote.\n\nNew details on Luigi Mangione's time in prison, evidence probed\n\nWoman whose sentence was commuted by Biden tells her story\n\nAmerican Airlines flight forced to make emergency landing after likely bird strike",

            "content": "UnitedHealth has been in the news since Brian Thompson, the CEO of its subsidiary UnitedHealthcare, was gunned down in New York in December 2024. The state of health insurance in America caused many to wonder if Thompson really deserved any sympathy.\n\nJust as UnitedHealth was undoubtedly hoping that bad news around the company would die down for a while, they have put themselves back in the spotlight. According to employee claims, despite profits, over 30,000 employees have been offered voluntary layoff packages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployees at UnitedHealth alleged that the company is laying off tens of thousands of workers.\n\nA TikTok content creator named Michelle C. seemed to be the one to break the news of UnitedHealth\u2019s supposed layoffs. It is not clear if Michelle is an employee of the company or not, but her insider information, combined with the mention of a company meeting, suggests she very well could be.\n\n\u201cUm, it has now been confirmed that 25,000 people are getting the option to be bought out before UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare, whatever you want to call them, decided to lay off people with no pay, with nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not wanting to give their people answers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, people had plenty of questions for Michelle regarding this information. One person requested that she share more whenever she was able to, so she did. \u201cSo I am getting, um, several comments asking me to share more of what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said in another video. \u201cUm, I don\u2019t have a lot of information, you know, a lot more, anyways, than what any of y\u2019all that were in the meeting have. I am trying to get as much as I can to give y\u2019all the information that\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all navigating \u2026 the same path at the same time,\u201d she explained. \u201cAt the end of the day, no one knows y\u2019alls situation better than each of y\u2019all. Do what\u2019s best for y\u2019all in your circumstances.\u201d\n\nAlthough brief and somewhat cryptic, Michelle\u2019s videos have garnered quite a bit of attention, with one even surpassing half a million views. Although little information is available, people clearly want to get to the bottom of what\u2019s going on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne man suggested this could present an opportunity for some UnitedHealth employees.\n\nAnother TikToker named Kyle, the owner of Green Flag Franchises, which provides \u201cfranchising services for current and future entrepreneurs,\u201d also heard the news of the impending layoffs. He tried to maintain a positive attitude when talking about them. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity, if you work at UnitedHealthcare, and you don\u2019t wanna work there anymore already, to go out on your own terms with a lot of new opportunity,\u201d he offered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyle did not say where he got his information from, but he provided more details. \u201cUnitedHealthcare, these guys, they just announced voluntary layoffs, up to 30,000 for people that accept the agreement between February 24 and sometime in the first week of March,\u201d he shared.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have all the details, but, uh, people that are taking the voluntary severance package will receive seven to 30 weeks of severance pay, uh, and I assume also cash out their vacation. That\u2019s pretty typical.\u201d\n\nAll of this comes following good financial reports from UnitedHealth.\n\nTypically, when a company plans to lay off its employees, it\u2019s because they\u2019re struggling financially. However, UnitedHealth reported that it\u2019s doing just the opposite. An Associated Press report from Tom Murphy stated that the company \u201cposted a better-than-expected profit in the final quarter of 2024.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Murphy also acknowledged the difficulties faced by healthcare companies during these uncertain times and reported that UnitedHealth\u2019s stock recently fell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf they are indeed real, UnitedHealth\u2019s layoffs are just the latest in a string of layoffs from multiple companies across different sectors. Unfortunately, it feels like a time when people should brace for the worst.\n\nMary-Faith Martinez is a writer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and Journalism who covers news, psychology, lifestyle, and human interest topics.",

They claim in the lawsuit that the use of AI to evaluate claims for post-acute care resulted in denials, which in turn led to worsening health for the patients and in some cases resulted in death.\n\nThey said the AI program developed by UnitedHealth subsidiary naviHealth, nH Predict, would sometimes supersede physician judgement, and has a 90% error rate, meaning nine of 10 appealed denials were ultimately reversed.\n\nThe plaintiffs also allege that UnitedHealthcare breached its insurance contract, which stipulated that it would cover medically necessary healthcare services and that coverage decisions be made by clinical staff.\n\nThe two remaining claims in the case are one for breach of contract and one for breach \"of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\"\n\nWHAT'S THE IMPACT\n\nUnitedHealth Group was sued over its alleged use of AI algorithms back in 2023.\n\nA STAT investigation, which was cited in the lawsuit, suggests UnitedHealth pressured employees to use the algorithm to issue payment denials to those on Medicare Advantage plans, setting a goal for employees to keep patient rehabilitation stays within 1% of the length of stay predicted by nH Predict.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that elderly patients are being prematurely kicked out of facilities, or forced to dip into their family savings, to continue to receive care.\n\n\"The fraudulent scheme affords defendants a clear financial windfall in the form of policy premiums without having to pay for promised care,\" the suit said.\n\nIn a statement issued at the time, UnitedHealth said nH Predict is not used to make coverage decisions, but instead is a \"guide to help us inform providers, families and other caregivers about what sort of assistance and care the patient may need both in the facility and after returning home.\"\n\nThe company added that coverage decisions are based on the terms of the members' health plans and on criteria laid out by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nCigna was sued the same year for allegedly using AI algorithms to deny claims, and Humana faced a similar accusation in court.\n\nCugna was accused of developing an algorithm known as PXDX to enable its doctors to automatically deny payments in batches of hundreds or thousands at a time for treatments that did not match certain preset criteria.\n\nA Cigna Healthcare spokesperson said at the time that the vast majority of claims reviewed through PXDX were automatically paid and that the process does not involve algorithms, AI or machine learning, but a simple sorting technology that has been used for more than a decade to match up codes.\n\nHumana was accused of cutting payments prematurely for rehabilitative care.

            "content": "This article is a part of your HHCN+ Membership\n\nRecent developments in the legal battle over the planned $3.3 billion UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UHG) acquisition of Amedisys (Nasdaq: AMED) have moved the case closer to trial and shed more light on how UnitedHealth and Amedisys are pursuing divestments and defending the transaction.\n\nFirst, UnitedHealth dropped its motion to dismiss the case, saying that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\u2013which is suing the block the deal\u2013had produced more detailed information about which counties the government alleges will be particularly harmed by weakened home health competition, should the acquisition be consummated.\n\nThen, UnitedHealth on Feb. 7 filed its response to the DOJ\u2019s complaint. Among other information, the response included more precise information about the number of locations that UnitedHealth and Amedisys are seeking to divest, to \u201cremedy any alleged competitive harm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe divestment plans involve a minimum of 121 home health facilities and seven hospice facilities. A planned deal to have VitalCaring acquire Amedisys locations recently collapsed, but \u201cdiligence processes are already underway to identify qualified buyers that will be able to operate and grow the divested assets,\u201d UnitedHealth stated in its response to the complaint.\n\nUnitedHealth further asserts that the government\u2019s claims of potential competitive harm are problematic for several reasons, including that the DOJ is \u201cignoring\u201d the proposed divestments and using \u201chyper-narrow market definitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf successful, this lawsuit would deprive patients, nurses, providers, and the overall\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhealthcare system of these significant benefits,\u201d the response stated. \u201cWorse, it would do so based on flawed economic theory, artificially narrow geographic markets, out-of-context quotations from a handful of documents, and with zero regard for the actual improvements to patient satisfaction and quality of care that would flow from the transaction.\u201d\n\nNext steps in the case will come quickly, with a scheduling conference scheduled to take place Feb. 20.\n\nIn this week\u2019s exclusive, members-only HHCN+ Update, I analyze UnitedHealth\u2019s response to the DOJ and offer key takeaways, including:\n\n\u2013 The significance of a seemingly minor aspect of UnitedHealth\u2019s argument, related to specialized care programs\n\n\u2013 How the case is emblematic of the government\u2019s sometimes fraught pursuit of value-based care and Medicare Advantage (MA) expansion\n\n\u2013 What the most profound impact of the case will be\n\nThe value-based care conundrum\n\nAn important aspect of the argument that UHG is making for the Amedisys acquisition revolves around value-based care and Medicare Advantage.\n\n\u201cFolding Amedisys into UHG\u2019s mission to better coordinate patient care and clinical alignment will also reduce hospital readmissions, saving patients\u2014and the healthcare system\u2014tens of millions of dollars,\u201d the company stated in its response to the DOJ\u2019s complaint.\n\nThese goals of more coordinated care and lower costs are major objectives of the federal government itself, as UHG also emphasized in its response:\n\n\u201cAmong other benefits, this acquisition will fill gaps in patients\u2019 continuum of care and will provide UHG with an enhanced platform for its initiatives to expand value-based care\u2014a model of care that enjoys broad support across many constituencies, including CMS [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services).\u201d\n\nIndeed, CMS is pushing for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to be enrolled in some form of value-based care arrangement by 2030.\n\nAnother mega-trend shaping the health care sector is the expansion of Medicare Advantage, which itself is considered a type of value-based care, given that the program is meant to reward a combination of quality and cost efficiency. Medicare Advantage is expected to accelerate under the Trump administration. Key Trump picks for leadership positions\u2013including Dr. Mehmet Oz as CMS chief\u2013have expressed strong support for Medicare Advantage.\n\nTogether, the push for value-based care generally and Medicare Advantage specifically almost certainly are driving consolidation in the health care sector. That\u2019s because health care leaders perceive that scale is important to success in these models.\n\nIn summing up the findings of a survey asking health system executives about their motivations in acquiring physician practices, RAND cited the ability to \u201cspread financial risk so that the health system can successfully participate in value-based payment contracts, such as Accountable Care Organizations,\u201d as well as \u201cto have greater leverage in price negotiations with payers.\u201d The executives also spoke about gaining greater control over multiple settings in order to better coordinate care and manage population health.\n\nCertainly, at-home care providers have spoken repeatedly about the need for greater scale in order to be empowered participants in value-based care and Medicare Advantage.\n\n\u201cThe thesis for why we want to continue to grow is to be able to get deep penetration within our markets; that makes us a more attractive partner for accountable care organizations (ACOs) and more appealing service provider for payers,\u201d Jeff Wiberg, CEO of Family Resource Home Care, said at HHCN\u2019s Capital + Strategy conference in 2019.\n\nMore recently, a growing chorus of providers have spoken about the challenges in negotiating favorable or even reasonable Medicare Advantage rates without the leverage that scale would provide. Enhabit (NYSE: EHAB) made waves by walking away from MA contracts with UHG last year; this move was possible only because Enhabit\u2013which operates more than 250 home health locations and 100 hospice locations\u2013was able to forge two new large national MA contracts and more than 60 other new contracts through its payer innovation strategy.\n\nOne significant facet of the UHG case is the fact that the company\u2019s own insurance business, UnitedHealthcare, is the nation\u2019s largest Medicare Advantage provider. The government alleges that the Amedisys acquisition would both give UnitedHealth more bargaining power with third-party insurers and enable the company itself to \u201ccommand higher reimbursement rates.\u201d\n\nConcerns about the overall scale of UHG and the influence that the company wields over nearly every dimension of U.S. health care extend well beyond the Amedisys deal, and are at the center of other DOJ investigations. But UHG is hardly the only conglomerate to pursue vertical integration in a bid for greater control over various components of the health care system. The business strategy seems to make more sense year upon year, as the federal government has enacted policies and pushed providers and payers to pursue goals that have required scale and driven consolidation. Now, through various efforts\u2013including the lawsuit against Amedisys deal\u2013the feds are intervening to prevent this quest for scale and integration from creating what some regulators and enforcers see as monopolist organizations.\n\nThis is a conundrum that is perhaps inevitable in value-based care models and Medicare Advantage. After all, MA is a private-public program that has to balance the public good with the exigencies of profit-driven, private sector businesses; the government might have no choice but to both feed the MA beast and try to keep it under control.\n\nThis means that a line has to be drawn between sought-after integration across the health care sector and unlawful consolidation of providers, payers and other entities. Drawing that line is difficult and will not be accomplished through this single home health lawsuit, but to the extent that the outcome\u2013whatever it is\u2013contributes to defining that line, that will be the case\u2019s most significant legacy.\n\nSpecialized care and the future of home health\n\nAnother sentence that caught my eye in UHG\u2019s response to the DOJ concerned specialized care programs:\n\n\u201cCombining LHC\u2019s and Amedisys\u2019s services will also allow the company\u2019s agencies to broaden the types of care they offer, as each of the merging parties has separately developed specialized clinical programs that the other does not currently offer\u2014including programs focused on diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.\u201d\n\nImplicit in this statement is the fact that such specialized programs are needed, and increasingly so, as the acuity level of home health patients has been on the rise. About a year ago, Bayada Home Health Care President Michael Johnson shared findings from an analysis of four years of payment data, which showed an increase in patients needing neuro rehab, cardiac care and complex behavioral health.\n\nBayada is hardly the only provider observing this trend, which is tied in part to the expansion of value-based care and MA; with payment models incentivizing shorter high-cost hospital and skilled nursing facility stays, there is a push to discharge patients to the home setting more rapidly and with more complex conditions. But there are other trends at play here as well, including the evolution of technology that enables more sophisticated care to be delivered in the home.\n\nProviding specialized care for complex diagnoses requires not just particular technology but other resources. Just two weeks ago, we reported on Amedisys\u2019 specialized care programs, which among other components include \u201ca disease-specific emergency medical record (EMR) pathway, patient self-care guides, informational placards, success logs and educational resources for clinicians,\u201d according to Barbara Andazola, vice president of clinical practice, strategy and programs at Amedisys.\n\nFurthermore, with reimbursement rates putting pressure on home health providers\u2019 bottom lines, recruiting, paying and supporting clinicians with specialized skills also is a daunting challenge, and one that demands investment.\n\n\u201cEach clinician must complete mandatory learning and relevant skills validation both upon hiring and annually thereafter,\u201d Andazola told HHCN. \u201cOur disease-specific program materials are reviewed and updated as needed by our corporate clinical multidisciplinary team at least once a year and whenever advancements in care or standards are published. We provide supplemental training for clinicians and patients when updates are necessary. This typically involves live training sessions and skills validation for clinicians, which may include partnerships with product manufacturers or service providers.\u201d\n\nPerhaps rising acuity in home health favors the UHG-Amedisys deal, which would arguably create a combined company that will offer a wider array of specialized services, with more resources to ensure high-quality care to complex patients. On the other hand, the DOJ already seems to be arguing that UHG and Amedisys currently have the resources to offer specialized care programs, and they should remain separate and compete for complex patients.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is the stakes are high with regard to patient wellbeing if home health providers lack the skills or resources to provide more complex care going forward, especially with the pressure that home health providers are under from reimbursement policy and MA rates. Consider this disturbing comment that a home health provider submitted to CMS, during the 2025 payment rule comment period:\n\nIn our agency, we recently had to refer a patient who was sent to us to another agency due to the patient\u2019s insurance. The patient developed a pressure wound and the nurse who was sent to treat the patient was not properly trained in wound care. Over the next few weeks, the patient reported that the wound was increasing in severity and he was concerned that the nurse did not seem to know what she was doing. He requested that she get some additional help. The nurse brought her supervisor to observe the wound care provided and ask if it was proper or adequate. The supervisor instructed her that the only thing she could do correctly at that point was call an ambulance for the patient. The patient had developed gangrene in the wound and was transported to a hospital. A few weeks later, the patient\u2019s leg was amputated just below the knee.\n\nThis incident appears to highlight how patients are suffering due to both the insurance landscape and home health providers\u2019 struggle to keep pace with rising acuity. The same commenter noted that the \u201cincidence of home health admissions that include wound care\u201d are on the rise.\n\nRegardless of how the legal battle plays out, I do hope that the parties involved in the Amedisys case recognize and take into account the changing nature of the patients served by home health companies, and the implications that these changes hold for what level of scale and sophistication is appropriate and even necessary for providers to achieve.",

Clare Locke and Dominion ultimately won the lawsuit, receiving a payout of $787.5 million.\n\nIn serving UnitedHealth, the law firm has been tasked with policing claims online that the company deems inaccurate and irresponsible.

            "content": "A Minnesota judge is allowing a breach-of-contract claim to continue against UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries over the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nDistrict Judge John R. Tunheim granted UnitedHealth a partial win by dismissing negligence, unfair and deceptive insurance practices, and similar consumer protection claims.\n\nThe lawsuit dates to November 2023, with plaintiffs claiming that UnitedHealth relies on an algorithm to deny rehabilitation care to seriously ill patients, even as UnitedHealth is aware that the algorithm has \u201ca 90% error rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fraudulent scheme affords Defendants a clear financial windfall in the form of policy premiums and federal funding without having to pay for promised care,\u201d the lawsuit alleges, \u201cwhile the elderly are prematurely kicked out of care facilities nationwide or forced to deplete family savings to continue receiving necessary medical care, all because an AI model \u2018disagrees\u2019 with their real live doctors\u2019 determinations.\u201d\n\nThe class-action lawsuit was filed by past patients or their heirs who had a UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage plan. It followed an in-depth investigation by STAT, which covers health and science news, detailing how UnitedHealth allegedly used a computer algorithm to cut off care to older patients.\n\nThe STAT report claimed that internal documents show UnitedHealth managers set a goal for clinical employees to keep patients rehab stays within 1% of the days projected by the algorithm.\n\nUnitedHealth Group purchased NaviHealth, an automated care management system, in May of 2020 for over $1 billion. It is behind nH Predict, the AI model that UnitedHealth uses in patient care. The health insurer has said it uses the AI tool merely as \u201ca guide\u201d in making decisions.\n\nIn its motion for dismissal, UnitedHealth argued that the patients named in the lawsuit had not completed appeals to their insurance claims being denied.\n\nA spokesperson for UnitedHealth sent InsuranceNewsNet this statement:\n\n\"Our number one priority is to ensure patients are receiving the care they need. That\u2019s the purpose of the naviHealth tool \u2013 it is used by our clinical care support team to suggest the care and services they should be receiving during their time in the facility or after returning home and to help patients, as well as their families, caregivers and providers, plan for their next step in care. We believe the lawsuit is based on unfounded allegations and mischaracterizes the incredibly valuable work of our experienced and compassionate clinicians. Coverage decisions are only made by medical directors \u2013 not by AI - in accordance with CMS Medicare coverage criteria.\"\n\nThe use of AI to deny claims is a popular topic of litigation, including a Cigna class-action lawsuit.\n\n\u2018Disciplined and terminated\u2019\n\nPlaintiffs claim that employees who deviate from the nH Predict AI projections are \u201cdisciplined and terminated, regardless of whether a patient requires more care.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth relies on the AI model to short-circuit post-acute care because it can, the lawsuit states. The plaintiffs say very few patients appeal denied claims, and there is no accountability for any wrong AI decisions. \u201cIn many cases\u201d costs are shifted to the American taxpayers, the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\u201cIn their coverage denial letters, Defendants inform patients who qualify for traditional Medicare that their coverage is being denied solely due to their Medicare eligibility,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants direct these patients to enroll in the government-subsidized Medicare program while using AI to make meritless coverage determinations that are not based on the patients\u2019 medical need.\u201d\n\nIn October, a Senate investigation into denial rates for coverage via Medicare Advantage concluded that UnitedHealthcare's rates \"accelerated significantly once NaviHealth began managing post-acute care,\" particularly when it came to coverage for patients in skilled nursing facilities.\n\nOne plaintiff\u2019s story\n\nThe plaintiffs include Carol Clemens. On Dec. 2, 2023, she had a severe medical episode caused by methemoglobinemia, leading to her hospitalization at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, Minn. Clemens \u201clost consciousness, collapsed, and displayed life-threateningly low blood oxygen levels, causing her skin to turn blue,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nMethemoglobinemia is a blood disorder in which an abnormal form of hemoglobin accumulates in the blood, leading to an oxygen deficiency.\n\nOn Dec. 18, Clemens was transferred to a skilled nursing facility, and her doctor prescribed one month of speech, occupational, and physical therapy. After 10 days in the facility, UnitedHealth denied Clemens\u2019 coverage, the lawsuit says, and she appealed.\n\nOn Dec. 29, Clemens\u2019 appeal was denied, stating that \u201cthe rehab care was not medically necessary,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cShe was unable to eat solid foods, and her doctor recognized her as being at risk of aspiration. Mrs. Clemens had not yet completed her speech therapy and was unable to speak more than a few words. ... Clemens was also unable to walk without assistance.\u201d\n\nUnable to afford the facility, Clemens returned home on Jan. 3 and suffered a fall at home three days later. Three days after that, she suffered a hemorrhage and was transported to the emergency room. It was determined that Clemens was suffering from a severe brain bleed, the lawsuit says.\n\nShe was discharged from the hospital on Jan. 26, 2024, and her doctor ordered rehab until Feb. 29. UnitedHealth covered her rehab stay from Jan. 31 to Feb. 15, the lawsuit states.\n\nAt the time plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 5, 2024, Clemens remained in the skilled nursing facility and her out-of-pocket expenses totaled $16,768, the lawsuit says.\n\n\u00a9 Entire contents copyright 2025 by InsuranceNewsNet.com Inc.

But the program\u2019s pay structure means that the more care insurers deny, the more in taxpayer dollars they get to keep for themselves.\n\n\n\nNow, UnitedHealth was pushing to terminate the 82-year-old\u2019s rehab coverage.\n\nJackie and his son appealed UnitedHealth\u2019s decision and won. But the corporate giant issued another coverage termination letter the following week, then another one the week after that.\n\nMartin was a quiet man who didn\u2019t like conflict. The repeated denials left him exhausted.\n\n\u201cWe talked and he said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m tired of this process every week. Let me just go home and see how I do,\u2019\u201d Robby recalled.\n\nSoon after returning home, Jackie told his family he was no longer getting better and needed to find another care option.

But in a statement, Optum said its \u201cnumber one priority is ensuring patients receive the care they need\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit has no merit and should be dismissed, as we have asked the court to do,\u201d the statement declared, arguing that the company\u2019s coverage decisions \u201care made by medical directors in accordance with Medicare coverage criteria for Medicare Advantage Plans\u201d.\n\nMartin\u2019s struggle to access care after a hospital visit is not a rare occurrence for older people enrolled in UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare Advantage program.\n\nIn recent years, UnitedHealth has ramped up its efforts to deny care for older patients following strokes, falls and injuries that require rehab, according to an October 2024 investigation by the US Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. The federal inquiry found that UnitedHealth\u2019s prior authorization denial rate for post-acute care for older people on Medicare Advantage shot up from 8.7% in 2019 to 22.7% in 2022. For Medicare Advantage seniors seeking post-acute care in nursing homes specifically, UnitedHealth\u2019s denial rate jumped up dramatically during that period, from 1.4% to 12.6%, amounting to more than 34,000 denials.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the spokesperson for UnitedHealth\u2019s subsidiary said the Senate committee investigation \u201cmischaracterizes\u201d Medicare Advantage and the company\u2019s clinical practices while ignoring federal criteria \u201cdemanding greater scrutiny around post-acute care\u201d.\n\nThe corporate spokesperson also added that the company \u201cultimately\u201d pays \u201c98% of all claims\u201d it receives, when they are submitted in \u201ca timely manner with complete, non-duplicate information\u201d.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s past coverage denials caught renewed attention after the December killing of Brian Thompson, a top executive who helped establish one of its subsidiaries as the dominant player in the Medicare Advantage market.\n\n\n\nWeeks before Thompson\u2019s killing, Biden administration officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed new rules to crack down on what it described as the \u201cinappropriate\u201d use of prior authorization by Medicare Advantage insurers. But it is unclear how eager the Trump administration and the Republican Congress will be to regulate insurers.\n\nIn public statements, Trump\u2019s pick to head CMS, Dr Mehmet Oz, and Republican policy leaders associated with the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 have shown more interest in expanding Medicare Advantage than in curbing coverage denials under the program.\n\nRepublican senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the new chair of the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations, did not respond to requests for comment about whether he planned to have his committee continue to investigate United Healthcare and other Medicare Advantage insurers.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal, the investigations committee\u2019s former chair, said older Americans like Jackie Martin \u201cshould receive the care they need\u201d without delays or denials.\n\n\u201cFor Jackie, his family, and the countless other Medicare Advantage enrollees, we must fight denials of post-acute care,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cI will continue to speak out and hold private insurers accountable for putting profits over people.\u201d\n\nThe process\n\nBefore he suffered a fall on the hardwood floor of his kitchen that left him with a back fracture, Jackie Martin walked two to three miles a day and ran on the treadmill at his local Y in Kingsport, Tennessee.\n\nJackie\u2019s subsequent recovery in the nursing home was slow, but he was making progress. So when Robby heard his father\u2019s rehab coverage was being cut off, he started calling everyone he could.\n\n\n\nFirst, Robby called the employee of the UnitedHealth subsidiary, NaviHealth, who had barged into his father\u2019s nursing home room at 2.30am.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Well, at NaviHealth, we have a procedure in place where we issue these weekly discharge notices automatically in our system,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\n\nNext, Robby said, he called a social worker at the nursing home.\n\nView image in fullscreen Jackie Martin with his son Robby Martin. Jackie\u2019s struggle to access care after a hospital visit is not a rare occurrence for older people enrolled in UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare Advantage program. Photograph: Jessica Tezak/The Guardian\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Robby \u2026 the last six months here NaviHealth has been kicking out all my patients before they\u2019re ready for self-care,\u2019\u201d he recalled the social worker saying. (The social worker did not respond to requests for comment for this story.)\n\nAfter that, Robby arranged a conference call with a manager from the UnitedHealth subsidiary, who said the notices would keep coming every week, Robby recalls.\n\n\u201cThis is our process and this is what we do,\u201d he recalls her saying. (The manager declined to comment for this story.)\n\n\n\nRobby even tried the main number at UnitedHealth, but he couldn\u2019t get anyone to help.\n\n\u201cI realized it was a kinda circular thing, where I could not get anything done with anybody \u2026 ,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most frustrating thing that you ever go through. You feel powerless.\u201d\n\nRobby and Jackie had successfully appealed UnitedHealth\u2019s first two denial letters. But the week after the conference call with the manager, UnitedHealth sent Martin a third coverage termination letter. The father and son decided to stop appealing.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that these repeat coverage denials were driven by a secret AI algorithm \u201cwithout any consideration\u201d for Jackie\u2019s \u201ccurrent condition\u201d. UnitedHealth says that algorithm is used to inform providers about care a patient may need, not \u201cto make coverage determinations\u201d.\n\nOut of breath\n\nOn 19 May 2023, Jackie returned home from the rehab facility to the split foyer house he had raised Robby in. He could get out of bed on his own. But when he tried to walk more than five steps, he found himself out of breath.\n\nThree days after going home, the retired foreman told his children he was no longer improving.\n\nThe next day, Jackie told his daughter he wasn\u2019t feeling well, but there was no nurse to check on him. Hours later, he got up to go to the bathroom. There, his heart gave way.\n\nView image in fullscreen A photo of Jackie Martin with his family. Photograph: Jessica Tezak/The Guardian\n\nFor the next six months, Robby said, he did not think much about UnitedHealth as he grieved. Eventually, a thought kept resurfacing: he had followed the rules. He had appealed, won and appealed again on behalf of his father. He had elevated the issue to corporate, and still the company kept denying his father coverage.\n\nRobby searched online for any lawsuits against UnitedHealth\u2019s subsidiary. He found that two families had already taken the conglomerate to court for cutting off their loved ones\u2019 rehab coverage. He decided to join them.\n\nRobby says he hopes the litigation will change UnitedHealth\u2019s coverage denial practices.\n\n\u201cYou know, the small person really doesn\u2019t matter to them. They\u2019re a multibillion-dollar company \u2026 ,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, they also know that these patients that are 80 years old, that it doesn\u2019t matter if they die.\u201d\n\nAttorneys representing UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries in the case did not respond to requests for comment. In legal filings, the company\u2019s counsel has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the plaintiffs have \u201cfailed to exhaust\u201d the federally regulated appeals process for challenging coverage decisions.\n\nIn a statement, Glenn Danas, one of Martin\u2019s lawyers and a partner at the Clarkson Law Firm, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that United has no intent to act in the best interest \u2013 and best health \u2013 of the people they insure.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota US district court judge John R Tunheim has not yet issued a ruling on UnitedHealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which could come as soon as the end of this month.",

Through its UnitedHealthcare and Optum segments, it provides insurance, technology-driven health solutions, and pharmacy care services globally.\n\nShares of UNH have underperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. UNH has risen 1.9% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has gained 20.5% . However, DVA stock has risen 4.3% on a YTD basis, outpacing SPX's 2.9% YTD gain.\n\nLooking closer, the Minnetonka, Minnesota-based company has slightly outpaced the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLV ) 1.1% rise over the past 52 weeks.\n\nUnitedHealth Group's stock fell over 6% on Jan. 16 after reporting Q4 revenue of $100.8 billion, missing the analyst estimate . The company\u2019s medical loss ratio rose to 87.6%, exceeding the expected 86%, while profit margins declined from 5.8% to 5.5%. UnitedHealthcare revenue increased 4.7% to $74.1 billion, and Optum revenue grew 9.4% to $65.1 billion, but cost pressures weighed on overall performance. Concerns over rising medical expenses, government scrutiny of pharmacy benefit managers like OptumRx, and tighter reimbursement policies also contributed to investor caution.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect UNH\u2019s EPS to grow 6.8% year-over-year to $29.54. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 24 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 22 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings and two \u201cModerate Buys.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 7, Truist analyst David MacDonald lowered UnitedHealth\u2019s price target to $610 while maintaining a \u201cBuy\" rating, citing a mixed 2025 outlook for Healthcare Services. While demographic trends and value-based care remain favorable, concerns over increased government cost controls create uncertainty for the sector.\n\nAs of writing, UNH is trading below the mean price target of $639.21. The Street-high price target of $700 implies a modest potential upside of 32.2% from the current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Buzzworthy developments of the past few days.\n\nA federal judge has vacated five of seven complaints against UnitedHealth Group\u2014yet is allowing the AI-implicated suit to advance. This is the class action in which a handful of Medicare Advantage enrollees accuse the insurer of using AI to reflexively deny claims. The lawsuit , filed with a federal court in Minnesota, gives several examples of the harm allegedly done by the AI-aided claims denials. One describes a series of refusals to pay for a 74-year-old\u2019s stroke care. The patient ended up on the hook for more than $70,000 only to die in an assisted-living facility, according to representatives of the decedent\u2019s estate. The suit charges UnitedHealth with \u201cbank[ing] on patients\u2019 impaired conditions, lack of knowledge and lack of resources to appeal erroneous AI-powered decisions.\u201d In a written ruling , Judge John Tunheim gives his rationale for dismissing the five counts and hands down his call. \u201cThe only claims that survive \u2026 are the claims for breach of contract and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the Court will only need to evaluate compliance with the insurance agreements,\u201d Tunheim writes. \u201cAccordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part UHC\u2019s motion to dismiss, allowing Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims to proceed.\u201d Courthouse News Service has more .\n\n\n\nProvider orgs ought to take a human-centric approach to clinical AI adoption. That\u2019s humans as in healthcare workers . Or at least those who\u2019ll use the technology. Healthcare AI developers, for their part, should create products that \u201cultimately serve the needs of their end users, improve their daily lives and do not negatively disrupt existing systems or ways of working.\u201d The advice is from four professional people familiar with the field. Their guidance, posted Feb. 13 in Mondaq , calls for creating a set of \u201cuser personas\u201d to account for the job-specific ways in which healthcare workers work. \u201cAn understanding of technology usage patterns, workflow bottlenecks and real-life stories from end-users,\u201d the authors explain , \u201chelps craft the persona\u2019s behaviors, skills, needs and preferences for using technology solutions.\u201d\n\n\n\nCVS Health is rolling out a new app to more fully digitize consumers\u2019 interactions with the company. The tool features AI-powered search and chat functions. In a Feb. 12 earnings call, chief strategy officer Larry McGrath named digitization as one of four strategic that will guide CVS from here on out. \u201cWe\u2019re leveraging AI to create a more intuitive workflow and faster turnaround times to reduce frustrations for our members and provider partners,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cThe broader demographic trends of an aging population, advances in AI and technology, the need for more personalized care and the expectations of the American public to create an improved consumer experience are opportunities where we are best positioned to lead.\u201d CVS\u2019s announcement of the new app is here , and the Motley Fool has the full transcript of this week\u2019s earnings call.\n\n\n\nPicture a nurse or physician assistant getting coached in real time by an AI agent inside a mobile clinic. Coached to do what, you ask? Oh, just patient-care things normally reserved for doctors. Now picture the action taking place in a rural area where human physicians are few and far between. The scenario makes more sense now, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the brainchild of HHS\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H. The agency is funding a couple of multimillion-dollar research projects to bring the idea to fruition. At one of the sites chosen to do the hands-on work, the University of Michigan, a professor of robotics and computer science explains the plan. \u201cWe want to bring the hospital to the house or to the church parking lot,\u201d says Jason Corso, PhD, or anyplace, really, \u201cwhere the nearest medical center that performs the care the patient needs might be two hours away.\u201d ARPA-H program overview here .\n\n\n\nThe average hospital produces 50 petabytes of data each year. The typical medical record exceeds half the word count of Hamlet . Most clinical notes are bursting with redundant information. Gastroenterologist and writer Spencer Dorn, MD, MPH, MHA, reminds us of these realities to illustrate the growing utility of clinical summaries generated quickly and quite smartly by AI. Such documentations \u201cincreasingly converge with other AI tools, most obviously AI scribes, which effectively turn conversations into notes,\u201d Dorn points out in Forbes . \u201cHowever, only one-third of clinical note text derives from conversations. Summarization tools can capture the remaining two-thirds of note text deriving from other parts of the medical record.\u201d He has quite a bit more to say about this topic. Hear him out here .\n\n\n\nIn Scotland, some healthcare thought leaders feel the need to reassure the public that healthcare AI is nothing to fear. One is Katriona Brooksbank, PhD, of the University of Glasgow. \u201cAI cannot operate in isolation,\u201d she writes in a short opinion piece published by The Herald . \u201cClinicians must review AI-generated results before diagnosis or treatment decisions are made, ensuring patient care remains safe and effective.\u201d AI will not replace human clinicians, she adds , and \u201cshould instead be looked upon as a powerful, well-tested tool.\u201d\n\n\n\nBack in the States, they\u2019re talking about the evolution of medical decision-making into \u2018an iterative dialogue\u2019 between physicians and AI. \u201cWhere doctors once relied solely on clinical expertise and static resources, they now engage in a dynamic exchange with LLMs\u201d (large-language AI models). It\u2019s a dynamic that \u201cchallenges assumptions and expands thinking,\u201d innovation theorist John Nosta observes in Psychology Today . \u201cWith medical knowledge increasing exponentially, this iterative approach helps physicians process vast amounts of information while maintaining clinical judgment.\u201d Nosta is watching for medicine to take AI well beyond its present role as a clinical efficiency booster. Human-AI combos, he suggests, may produce nothing less than elevated human reasoning .\n\n\n\nThen too, AI will never be a cure-all for what ails U.S. healthcare. \u201cIf we are unwilling to change the problems within the health system, AI is not going to solve all those problems for us,\u201d says Adam Sharp, MD, chief executive of Galvan, a Utah-based blockchain company focused on promoting health and wellness. How about on the level of the individual patient? \u201cIf people just think it\u2019s going to magically improve your life,\u201d Sharp tells a TV news operation in Salt Lake City, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s coming anytime soon.\u201d\n\n",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other large cap dividend growth stocks.\n\nInvestors continue to favor large-cap stocks, as these companies often serve as the foundation of popular index funds and are well-known among both seasoned professionals and casual traders. Moreover, large-cap firms have demonstrated their ability to withstand economic uncertainty, thanks to their strong market presence and substantial cash reserves, which help them weather financial downturns with relative ease. For the second consecutive year in 2024, US large-cap stocks outpaced cash, bonds, and international equities, securing the top spot in market performance.\n\nAlso read: 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA Morningstar report revealed that over the 10-year period ending June 30, 2024, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks by an average of more than 6 percentage points annually. This disparity stems from differences in sector exposure\u2014small-cap benchmarks have a lower concentration of technology stocks and a greater presence in traditional industries like consumer cyclicals, financials, real estate, and industrials. Although economic growth has been robust, these sectors have struggled to match the pace set by technology-related stocks.\n\nIn addition, according to JPMorgan Wealth Management, large-cap stocks play a key role in driving long-term capital appreciation for investors. Over the 10-year period from 2013 to March 2023, large-cap stocks delivered a total return of 162%, outperforming mid-cap and small-cap stocks, which posted returns of 139% and 108%, respectively.\n\nLarge-cap stocks demonstrate their resilience through their ability to increase dividends even in times of market distress. Several leading companies have maintained decades-long streaks of dividend growth, weathering major economic crises such as the 2008 recession and the 2020 pandemic. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that large-cap firms with a track record of consistent dividend increases have shown relative strength during downturns, suffering smaller losses than the broader market. In addition, these companies have often outperformed during periods of market stagnation and have participated in a substantial share of gains during bull markets.\n\nDividend growth is a key factor when evaluating dividend stocks, as companies that consistently raise their payouts have historically outperformed those that do not. A report by RMB Capital found that between 1972 and 2018, companies that initiated or grew their dividends achieved an average annual return of 9.62%, significantly surpassing the 2.40% return of non-dividend-paying firms. Even the broader market, with a 7.30% return, lagged behind dividend growers. The report also emphasized that companies with a strong history of dividend increases have not only sustained but expanded their payouts, even during economic downturns. From a portfolio perspective, dividend growth stocks provide solid diversification, as they are spread across multiple industries. This offers an advantage over high-yield portfolios, which tend to be concentrated in mature sectors like utilities and, prior to 2007, financials.\n\nAnalysts recommend incorporating dividend stocks into income portfolios, especially as several major tech companies have adopted dividend policies this year. With robust cash flows, these firms are well-positioned to maintain and expand their dividend payouts over time. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best large-cap dividend growth stocks.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we first used a stock screener to identify large-cap dividend stocks with market capitalization above $10 billion. From that list, we shortlisted stocks that have 5-year average dividend growth rates of above 10%. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend growth rates.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 14.59%\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) ranks seventh on our list of the best dividend stocks. The American health insurance company offers a wide range of related products and services to its consumers. The stock has surged modestly by just 1.9% in the past year. Analysts believe that the company may face a somewhat challenging operating environment next year, its strategic initiatives and pricing strategies are likely to drive growth. In addition, the company has effectively improved its operating cost ratio through strategic portfolio initiatives, which bodes well for future profitability.

            "content": "Welcome back to The Flyover, your daily digest of important, overlooked, and/or interesting Minnesota news stories.\n\nUnitedHealth Will See You in Court\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough couple of years for the Minnetonka-based health industry giant UnitedHealth Group. Congress grilled the insurer following a major cyberattack last year. It\u2019s been accused of marking up generic drugs by thousands of a percent. Reports have shown that it surveils health-care workers, uses predictive tech to deny claims, and limits care to autistic kids. It disappointed Wall Street last quarter with a mere $101.81 billion in revenue. Oh, also, the head of its insurance division was murdered.\n\nBut UnitedHealth has found a surefire way to fix its public image: Suing people who say bad things about it on the internet. Bloomberg Law reports that UHG has hired the law firm Clare Locke, defamation specialists best known for securing Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 $787.5 million settlement with Fox News, to take on its critics.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s foe isn\u2019t quite on the level of Fox: Its lawyers are going after a plastic surgeon in Austin, Texas, who made some heated complaints about her dealings with the company. Per UHG, she is \u201cusing her social media following to perpetuate inaccuracies, which is irresponsible, unethical and dangerous.\u201d But the doctor, Elisabeth Potter, is defending against the claim saying her post was accurate.\n\nCan\u2019t wait for voir dire on this one, if only for the prospective jurors\u2019 answers to the question, \u201cDo you have any opinions about health care insurers?\u201d\n\nFunding Freeze Fallout in St. Paul\n\nKinda hard to concentrate on what\u2019s happening around town while a ketamine-addled goon guts the republic, department by department. So let\u2019s local angle that shit and take a look at what effects the Trump administration\u2019s unconstitutional holds on federal spending have had on actual people in St. Paul, courtesy of Fred Melo at the Pioneer Press.\n\nMelo speaks to Center for Victims of Torture, Neighborhood House, and other nonprofits with a local footprint, some of whom are hopeful that courts will reverse the freeze but are suffering from depleted funds regardless. \u201cWe have to prepare for the worst and hope for the best,\u201d says Kelly Martinson of the Kids Count on Us childcare centers.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t have granted Bill Glahn from the Center of the American Experiment an opportunity to pontificate about fraud and tell us that Elon Musk is separating \u201cthe wheat from the chaff\u201d\u2014at least not without asking Glahn whether he thinks the executive branch has the power to unilaterally cancel congressional expenditures or not.\n\nBut Scott Roehm of the CVT knows what\u2019s happening here: \u201cThis is all about the Trump administration puffing its chest as much as it can to see how much power it can grab from the other two branches of government\u2026 consequences be damned.\u201d\n\nWarrant: Defense Lawyer Slipped Drug-Soaked Paperwork to Clients\n\nHere\u2019s a wild and kinda sad one for you. A search warrant filed Monday alleges that attorney Sarah Gad slipped papers soaked in cocaine and fentanyl to two of her clients in Hennepin County Jail.\n\nThe Star Tribune\u2019s Paul Walsh reports that, according to the warrant, the Sheriff\u2019s Office searched a trash bin outside Gad\u2019s home and found liquor bottles with illegal drugs on them and seized \u201cstacks of paperwork with a powdery residue on them, cocaine in a baggie, and methamphetamine\u201d from within her home. The attorney denies the charges. (\u201cI recycle, first of all,\u201d she tells the Strib.)\n\nGad, you may recall, got a lot of coverage when she announced that she would run against Rep. Ilhan Omar in the DFL primary for the Fifth Congressional District last year, with the Washington Post spotlighting her inspirational story of overcoming addiction and poverty.\n\nLove Bugs for Sale by Zoo\n\n\u201cGive someone bug-tterflies this Valentine\u2019s Day! This year, give a gift they\u2019re sure to remember when you name a bug after someone you love \u2026 or someone who just bugs you.\u201d So reads the copy for the Minnesota Zoo\u2019s ingenious new fundraising campaign, which, for a $15 donation, allows you naming rights to a cricket, mealworm, or other critter to be fed to one of the zoo\u2019s hungry inhabitants.\n\nThe zoo\u2019s Sarah Lennander tells MPR News that the campaign has been a hit, with kids and exes among the most common recipients of the gift. And donors are suggesting their own ideas for future campaigns. \u201cA husband called asking if he could name a piece of meat that would be fed to a komodo dragon, his wife\u2019s favorite animal,\u201d Lennander says. Our suggestion: Why not let people eat the bugs themselves?\n\nAt least one Friend of Racket has contributed to the zoo\u2019s campaign, naming her bug \u201cJacob Frey.\u201d As serious journalists, we would never condone such behavior.

Optum in February 2023 also acquired the home health and hospice provider LHC Group for $5.4 billion. DOJ in December 2024 filed the lawsuit to kill the deal. The state attorneys general of Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York are also plaintiffs in the suit.\n\nBut even if DOJ succeeds in blocking the deal, an M&A turndown is unlikely, according to Tyler Giesting, director of the transaction consulting firm West Monroe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I would expect there to be that much more of an additional chilling effect on market, M&A activity if DOJ were successful. There are a lot of other market factors. But as far as activity goes,\u201d Giesting told Hospice News. \u201cEverything seems to point to platforms gearing up to exit on the basis of favorable kind of tailwinds, relatively stable reimbursement landscape, particularly hospice, obviously the broader macro aging population trend. All of the things that point towards home-based care only growing.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ alleges that UnitedHealth Group is overcoming the competition by acquiring them rather than beating them in the market.\n\n\u201cUnitedHealth Group Incorporated and Amedisys, Inc. are two of the largest home health and hospice service providers in the country,\u201d DOJ indicated in the complaint. \u201cToday, competition between UnitedHealth and Amedisys benefits millions of Americans who need home health or hospice services. But the proposed merger between UnitedHealth and Amedisys would forever eliminate that competition.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDOJ\u2019s chief concern is that the combination of the two companies would dampen competition in the hospice and home health space. Should the transaction proceed, Optum would control 30% or more of the home health or hospice services in eight states, according to the Justice Department\u2019s complaint. The deal would expand Optum\u2019s home health and hospice footprint to five additional states, allowing the company to gain nearly 500 locations in 32 states.\n\nA UnitedHealth Group-Amedisys victory could lead the way for more larger acquisitions by payer companies.\n\n\u201cIt would set a precedent that allows larger health plans to pursue bigger and bigger home-based care providers for one space that is increasingly being looked at to affect [the health care] spend in a way that\u2019s positive for health plans,\u201d Joe Widmar, senior manager for West Monroe, told Hospice News. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if in an Amedisys victory, you start seeing a ratcheted up interest in larger home-based care enterprises.\u201d",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a multinational, Minnetonka, Minnesota-based healthcare and insurance company. It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. It is the world\u2019s 7th largest company by revenue and the largest insurer by annual premiums. It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers. Regarding the environment, the company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 which is well ahead of the global target. The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Growth Stocks With 10%+ Yearly Increases. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nDividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market\u2019s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn\u2019t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.\n\nDividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years\u2014such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative\u2014they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nDividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts\u2014they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.\n\nDividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index\u2019s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.\n\nWithin the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 14.59%\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a Minnesota-based health insurance company. It recently reported its fiscal year 2024 earnings, exceeding investor expectations with solid performance. The company generated $400 billion in revenue, reflecting an 8% increase from the previous year, driven by growth in its diverse services. Operating earnings for the year amounted to $32.3 billion, but after factoring in expenses related to responding to a cyberattack and challenges in South America, adjusted operating earnings were $34.4 billion.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) posted strong cash flow results that met investor expectations. The company generated $24.2 billion in operating cash flow for the year, which was 1.6 times its net income. Throughout 2024, it returned over $16 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, its return on equity reached 23.7%, demonstrating strong earnings and efficient capital management.\n\nThanks to its solid cash position, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) has built a strong dividend track record. The company began paying annual dividends in 1990 and switched to quarterly payouts in 2010, consistently increasing its dividend ever since, which makes UNH one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The company\u2019s per-share quarterly dividend comes in at $2.10 per share for a dividend yield of 1.59%, as of February 8.\n\nOverall UNH ranks 5th on our list of the best dividend stocks with dividend growth rates. While we acknowledge the potential for UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a multinational, Minnetonka, Minnesota-based healthcare and insurance company. It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. It is the world\u2019s 7th largest company by revenue and the largest insurer by annual premiums. It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers. Regarding the environment, the company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 which is well ahead of the global target. The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

            "content": "Two months after the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson sent shockwaves through the much-reviled U.S. health insurance industry, the company\u2019s parent, UnitedHealth Group, is making aggressive moves to protect its image.\n\nResponding to a slew of attacks online, often coupled with the glorification of Luigi Mangione (who was charged with Thompson\u2019s murder outside a midtown Manhattan hotel in December, and allegedly wrote a short manifesto calling health insurers \u201cparasites\u201d), the company has hired a law firm that specializes in defamation cases. Clare Locke, the Virginia-based practice, previously represented Dominion Voting Systems in a bombshell defamation suit that saw Fox News pay a settlement of $787.5 million for airing false allegations about the company\u2019s supposed role in voter fraud during the 2020 election.\n\nUnitedHealth appears eager to make a similar example of Elisabeth Potter, an Austin, Texas, plastic surgeon, and is accusing the doctor of \u201cusing her social media following to perpetuate inaccuracies, which is irresponsible, unethical, and dangerous.\u201d On Jan. 7, Potter posted a video on Instagram sharing her frustration with the U.S. insurance system, explaining in a text caption that during a procedure, \u201cI was interrupted by a call from United Healthcare \u2014 while the patient was already asleep on the operating table. They demanded information about her diagnosis and inpatient stay justification. I had to scrub out mid-surgery to call United, only to find that the person on the line didn\u2019t even have access to the patient\u2019s full medical information, despite the procedure already being pre-approved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond frustrating and, frankly, unacceptable,\u201d Potter continued. \u201cWe should be focused on care, not bureaucracy.\u201d The comments were rife with fury at UniteHealthcare and for-profit health insurance more broadly. \u201cLuigi for President,\u201d wrote one person, while another put in, \u201cOne day these health insurance companies will be dead.\u201d Editor\u2019s picks\n\nDays later, according to reporting from Bloomberg, Potter\u2019s attorney received a letter from Clare Locke instructing her to amend the post, apologize, and disavow threats of violence that UnitedHealth claimed had stemmed from the video. But Potter\u2019s legal counsel, Jessica Underwood, has said that there is nothing inaccurate in the video that needs correcting. \u201cDr. Potter will not be silenced by UnitedHealthcare\u2019s attempts to threaten and harass her,\u201d Underwood has said. The company, meanwhile, has argued that \u201cDr. Potter\u2019s claims that she was called out of surgery are false.\u201d Potter\u2019s Instagram video remains up on the platform, where it has received more than 350,000 likes.\n\nElsewhere, UnitedHealth took measures to prevent the dissemination of internal data about its denials of customer claims. (UnitedHealth Group\u2019s individual market plans are known to have one of the highest denial rates among all U.S. insurers, a fact that received much media attention in the wake of Thompson\u2019s death.) As The Lever reported, a day after President Donald Trump\u2018s inauguration in January, UnitedHealth submitted a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking for approval to block a shareholder proposal that it use a third-party auditor to assess \u201cprevious customer denial claims, particularly where a death was involved, to determine if denial letters included factually incorrect and insensitive information.\u201d In cases where this outside analyst determined that a coverage claim should not have been denied, the proposal says, those individuals and family members affected are to be sent an apology letter hand-signed by both a UnitedHealth executive and a member of the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s rationale for refusing a vote on such a policy, as its legal team wrote in the letter, is that the proposal was not submitted before \u201cthe applicable deadline.\u201d\n\nThen, on Jan. 31, the insurer sent a second letter to the SEC, seeking to prevent a shareholder vote on another proposal related to its claim denials. This proposal, if passed by investors, would recommend that UnitedHealth \u201cevaluate how company practices impact access to health care and patient outcomes, including analyses of how often prior authorization requirements or denials of coverage lead to delay or abandonment of medical treatment and serious adverse events for patients.\u201d The report produced through this review is also intended to encompass \u201cthe public health-related costs and macroeconomic risks created by the company\u2019s practices that limit or delay access to health care.\u201d Related Content\n\nIn their letter, UniteHealth rejected the notion of putting this proposal to a shareholder vote because it is \u201cvague and indefinite,\u201d and, it argued, an attempt to \u201cimpermissibly micromanage\u201d the company.\n\nThe insurance giant\u2019s attempts to police social media chatter about its business practices and its overtures to Trump\u2019s SEC dovetailed earlier this week when hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman shared his opinion of the company\u2019s future. \u201cIf I still shorted stocks, I would short United Healthcare,\u201d he posted to X on Tuesday, adding that the SEC \u201cshould do a thorough investigation of the company.\u201d He further mused, \u201cI would not be surprised to find that the company\u2019s profitability is massively overstated due to its denial of medically necessary procedures and patient care.\u201d Trending Stories Disturbed Concert's Pyrotechnics Damage Chicago Bulls' Championship Banners Justin Bieber Admits He Feels \u2018Unqualified and Unequipped\u2019 in Candid Post Amid Concerns About His Health Union Blasts Musk Over Retweet Blaming Holocaust on Public Workers Will Smith Meets Up With Doechii to Re-create Viral 'Anxiety' Dance From 'Fresh Prince'\n\nAckman later deleted the speculation, but UnitedHealth flagged his comments to the SEC for potential investigation. The company\u2019s stock price dipped the following day, and ended the week about 2.7 percent lower than it was on Tuesday. \u201cHealth insurance has long been subject to significant regulatory oversight and earnings caps,\u201d UnitedHealth said in a statement responding to the outspoken investor, one of many ultra-wealthy figures to back Trump in 2024 and post prolifically on social media about how only the MAGA movement could save the country. \u201cAny claims that health insurers, which typically have low- to mid-single digit margins, can somehow over-earn are grossly uninformed about the structure and strong regulatory oversight of the sector,\u201d the company noted.\n\nAll told, UnitedHealth is mounting a far stronger defense of its reputation than it did two months ago, when Thompson\u2019s slaying unleashed a flood of hostility that caught it somewhat off-guard. Now, the company looks like it\u2019s prepared to grind it out as Mangione\u2019s parallel state and federal trials get underway, with heated rhetoric likely to flare up once again.",

The increasing costs of healthcare services, evolving enrollment trends, and technological advancements are some of the key trends driving change and growth in the sector. According to a report by IMARC Group, the US health insurance market was valued at $453 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% during 2025-2033 to reach a value of $639 billion by the end of the forecast period.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Medical Stocks To Buy Under $20 and 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 2025.\n\nIn January 2025, the US government proposed significantly increasing the amount that it pays to insurers who offer Medicare Advantage plans. On January 10, Reuters reported that the government has suggested new reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage plans for 2026, which are run by private insurers. The rate changes proposed could increase payments to private insurance companies by 2.2%. This is a notable change from the 0.2% decrease last year.\n\nThe government payment rate impacts how much private insurance companies charge for monthly premiums, the types of benefits insurers offer, and how much insurers can profit. When factoring in a 2.1% risk score, the total payment increase is estimated at 4.3%, or over $21 billion. The risk score adjustment accounts for the possibility of higher payments for patients with severe health conditions.\n\nPrivate health insurance companies will use the payment rate to prepare bids for contracts for Medicare Advantage plans that they will offer in 2026. Around 65 million individuals are enrolled in the government\u2019s Medicare program which caters to people aged 65 and older or who are disabled. Over half of these individuals are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn wrote in a research note that this proposal is very favorable given the contentious political environment. He believes this proposal should positively affect health insurance stocks involved in this space. However, the proposed rate may be changed after feedback from insurers, other organizations, and the public. The final rate announcement is expected to be published on or before April 7, 2025.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 best health insurance stocks to buy in 2025, we looked for the largest health insurance companies. We also reviewed our own rankings, financial media reports, ETFs, and various online resources to compile a list of the best health insurance stocks. Next, we focused on the top 12 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 12 best health insurance stocks to buy in 2025 are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024.",

            "content": "Two 10-story towers planned for Opus; beginning of trend for area\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UHG) is preparing for growth, and it wants to house that growth in Minnetonka.\n\nThe health care company currently keeps its headquarters in the Opus Business Park, at 9900 Bren Road.\n\nIt\u2019s proposing to build two 10-story towers south of its headquarters and two parking ramps on a site just slightly larger than 10 acres at 9701 Data Park Drive.\n\nIf the plans are approved, which seem certain, the towers will set a new tone for the type of redevelopment for the area.\n\n\u201cThe market is driving more intense development,\u201d said Geoff Olson, planning consultant for the city. \u201cThe UHG project is a sign of the future for Opus II.\u201d\n\nConstruction of the Opus Business Park began in the mid-1970s by Rauenhorst Corp., which eventually became known as Opus Corp.\n\nThe concept at the time was to develop a mix of commercial and residential development, tied together with one-way roads.\n\nThe commercial development has been built up slightly more than originally planned, with a total of almost 4.3 million square feet of commercial space. Added to the mix are 1,400 units of apartments, condos and townhouses, and there about 400 hotel rooms.\n\nA 10-story tower isn\u2019t unprecedented in the area, as the 10-story Opus Center was built in the early 1980s and the 16-story Marriott was built a few years later.\n\nThe two towers proposed by UHG would be 650,000 square feet. In comparison, the Carlson Towers at Interstate highways 394 and 494 are 670,000 square feet.\n\nWhile UHG hopes to get in the ground this January for construction on the first tower and parking ramp, no timeline has been set for the second phase, which would include the second tower and ramp.\n\nThe site currently has a one-story, 150,000 square foot warehouse on it and a 450-stall surface parking lot, which were constructed in the mid-1970s and are currently owned by UHG.\n\nRenderings of the towers show precast panels, stone, glass and black metal trim for building materials.\n\nAs proposed, the first tower would include about 340,000 square feet and be built on the western part of the site, and a 1,900-stall parking ramp would be built to the south of it.\n\nThe ramp would have five stories above ground and two below. Phase-two plans call for building two additional stories on top of the ramp, something that nearby business owners have criticized.\n\nThe second 10-story tower would be slightly smaller at 300,000 square feet and the second ramp would be smaller at 1,250 stalls.\n\nThe timing on phase two will depend on UHG\u2019s growth as well as the completion of road improvements, most importantly to the Bren Road and Highway 169 interchange.\n\nTraffic flow tops the list of concerns mentioned at the public hearing held Oct. 26 and was one of the reasons city staff requested no action on the proposal at the Planning Commission meeting.\n\nCity staff admit they need to get a better grasp on how much traffic the development will generate given the uniqueness of UHG and the amount of parking it is requesting to build.\n\n\u201cThere is already congestion on 169 and this would add more traffic,\u201d said Olson. \u201cWe want to make sure the traffic impacts are accommodated for.\u201d\n\nMany of the more significant traffic improvements won\u2019t occur until the second phase, but road improvements are included in phase one as well.\n\nUHG is proposing to exceed the parking requirements.\n\n\u201cFunctionally, we want to make sure we have enough capacity,\u201d said Steve Dorgan, of CRESA Partners, which is assisting UHG in the development.\n\nBut planning commissioners and business owners along Blue Circle Drive were skeptical of the need.\n\n\u201cPerhaps by reducing parking spaces, we can address come of the residents\u2019 concerns,\u201d said Planning Commissioner Steve Adams.\n\nRobert DeBrey, who owns DeBrey Designs on Blue Circle Drive, echoed Adams\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThere are too many cars in this plan,\u201d said DeBrey,\n\nDeBrey also wondered why the council would approve this before it looked at the long-term plan for the area.\n\nThe city is planning to take a comprehensive look at the Opus area because of expected redevelopment.\n\nA meeting with the Planning Commission, Economic Development Authority and City Council has already occurred, but further study isn\u2019t expected until later this year.\n\nThe city and UHG also have yet to agree on the timing and financing of the road improvements.\n\nThe City Council has approved an agreement with the Opus company that owns the building that UHG uses, assuring them that the traffic improvements will not diminish the access or aesthetics of the current headquarters.\n\nThe two-phase proposal currently before the Planning Commission requires about 10 approvals by the City Council, notably a variance to allow a floor area ratio of 143 percent, which is 43 percent more than what is allowed without a variance.\n\nFloor area ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of gross square footage by the lot area.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re feeling this is a bloated project,\u201d said Doug Jines, who owns two businesses on Blue Circle Drive. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for this big project.\u201d\n\nFewer than 10 people spoke at the public hearing, with the majority of the speakers being business owners along Blue Circle Drive.\n\nThe Planning Commission delayed action on the project until Nov. 9 so that several issues could be resolved. The proposal will then go to the City Council.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always happy when a company in Minnetonka wants to expand. It\u2019s testament to our community,\u201d said Planning Commissioner Adams.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market\u2019s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump\u2019s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.\n\nSectors To Focus on in 2025\n\nFidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector\u2019s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.\n\nThe H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nGrowth Drivers Amidst Policy Shifts\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity\u2014mainly in industrials and healthcare\u2014 are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.\n\nEven though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration\u2019s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group has withdrawn its motion to dismiss the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust lawsuit challenging its proposed acquisition of Amedisys, a home care and hospice provider. According to the Minnesota Tribune, the healthcare giant stated that new information provided by the government in late January rendered its initial motion moot.\n\nLast November, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit arguing that UnitedHealth Group\u2019s acquisition of Amedisys would be presumptively anticompetitive. The agency claimed the merger would reduce competition in the home health and hospice industry. However, per the Minnesota Tribune, UnitedHealth initially contested the suit on the grounds that the government had not specified the geographic boundaries of the affected markets.\n\nOn January 29, the Justice Department responded to the motion by filing a list of 381 service areas where it alleged the acquisition would negatively impact competition. UnitedHealth Group, in its latest filing, acknowledged that this submission \u201cfinally identified\u201d the locations in question, leading the company to withdraw its motion.\n\nRelated: FTC Pushes to Dismiss Lawsuit Challenging Insulin Price Case Proceedings\n\nThe Justice Department maintained that it had already provided UnitedHealth and Amedisys with detailed geographic information before filing the lawsuit. In its court filing, the agency criticized the company\u2019s motion, arguing it was an attempt to gain premature discovery into the government\u2019s case. \u201cThis motion is defendants\u2019 latest attempt to obtain improper, premature discovery into details of the geographic markets alleged by plaintiffs,\u201d the filing stated.\n\nOn Thursday, Judge James Bredar of the U.S. District Court of Maryland ordered the motion to dismiss withdrawn. He also noted that UnitedHealth Group intends to formally respond to the Justice Department\u2019s complaint, after which the court will schedule a conference to proceed with the case.\n\nPer the Minnesota Tribune, UnitedHealth Group has pointed out that its Optum health services division and Amedisys currently operate in 37 and 40 states, respectively. However, the company argues that their combined market share accounts for only 12% of home health visits and 5% of hospice visits nationwide, suggesting that the merger would not significantly hinder competition.\n\nThe Justice Department, supported by attorneys general from Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, contends that the merger would harm both patients and labor markets by consolidating two of the largest home health and hospice providers in the country. With the motion to dismiss now withdrawn, the case is set to move forward, with both parties preparing for the next legal steps.\n\nSource: Minnesota Tribune",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nThe Dow is a highly recognized and influential stock market index that tracks the performance of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges, representing a wide range of industries. In the past 12 months, the index has surged by nearly 16%, and it has delivered a return of over 5% since the start of 2025.\n\nAlmost all of the companies in the index distribute dividends to their shareholders, with some having stronger dividend records than others. While there is a lot of focus on AI-driven capital gains, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that dividends have consistently been a key component of total returns. Over the long term, their importance grows. From 1987 to the end of 2023, about 55% of market returns have been generated from reinvested dividends.\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks lagged behind as the AI boom and growing interest in tech stocks shifted investor focus elsewhere. The Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, underperformed relative to the broader market. However, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term potential of dividend stocks. This confidence is driven by the substantial cash reserves many US companies hold, which provide a strong foundation for sustaining or increasing dividend payouts. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute reports that large-cap US companies collectively hold over $2.4 trillion in cash, creating significant opportunities to start or enhance dividends.\n\nAlso read: 12 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\n\nDividends are a strategy that requires patience, with rewards unfolding over time. For instance, if you had invested a dollar in the broader market in 1927 and didn\u2019t reinvest any dividends, it would now be worth $243. However, if dividends had been reinvested, that same dollar would have grown to $3,737. The good news is that you don\u2019t need to wait a century to see the growth potential of dividend stocks, as the near-term outlook is positive. A report from AGF Investments notes that global monetary easing in the latter half of 2024 has driven bond yields lower, making them less appealing compared to dividend-paying stocks. Moreover, companies that distribute higher dividends tend to have more financial leverage, and with lower bond yields, they can better manage their interest expenses, enhancing their financial performance and supporting continued dividend growth.\n\nChris Senyek, Chief Investment Strategist at Wolfe Research, offers an alternative approach to investing in dividend stocks. While most investors focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek recommends also considering companies that are starting to pay dividends or those that have recently cut their payouts. A new dividend often signals that management is confident in its ability to sustain earnings and cash flow, while also appealing to a broader group of investors.\n\nSenyek also pointed out that stocks of companies that reduce their dividends typically underperform before the cut, align with the broader market afterward, and then start to outperform about six months later. The strategy is to identify companies that might be at risk of cutting their dividends and reassess those that have already made cuts in recent months. To predict potential dividend cuts, Senyek looks for companies with high dividend yields, significant debt, and high payout ratios. For companies that might begin paying dividends, he focuses on those with strong free cash flow yields, active share buybacks, and manageable debt levels. With this in mind, we will now take a look at some of the best Dow dividend stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we examined the companies within the Dow Jones index and identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders. From that group, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of February 6. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nUpside Potential as of February 6: 20.9%\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a Minnesota-based health insurance company. It operates through two main divisions: UnitedHealthcare, one of the largest health insurance providers in the industry, and Optum, which offers patient care, provider services, analytics, and prescription benefit management. This extensive presence makes UnitedHealth Group a dominant force in the sector. Its vast scale provides significant bargaining power and competitive advantage, which has been a key driver of its long-term growth. Since the start of 2025, the stock has surged by over 4.5%.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) recently announced its fiscal year 2024 earnings, surpassing investor expectations with strong results. The company reported $400 billion in revenue, marking an 8% increase from the previous year, fueled by growth across its various services. Operating earnings for the year totaled $32.3 billion. However, after adjusting for costs associated with a cyberattack response and difficulties in South America, adjusted operating earnings reached $34.4 billion.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) delivered strong cash flow results that also met investor expectations. The company generated $24.2 billion in operating cash flow for the year, amounting to 1.6 times its net income. Over the course of 2024, it returned more than $16 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, its return on equity stood at 23.7%, reflecting robust earnings and effective capital management.\n\nDue to this solid cash position, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) holds a strong dividend history. The company started paying annual dividends in 1990 and shifted to quarterly payouts in 2010. Since then, it has raised its dividend regularly, which makes UNH one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $2.10 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.59%, as of February 6.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024, 112 hedge funds owned stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared with 114 in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is more than $15 billion.\n\nOverall UNH ranks 3rd on our list of the best Dow Jones dividend stocks to invest in according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration.

Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 1.67 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nUnitedHealth Group Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for UnitedHealth Group has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing UnitedHealth Group's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, UnitedHealth Group's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 5.50%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

( Jenn Ackerman for STAT)\n\nA federal judge will soon decide whether a class action lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group and a subsidiary over algorithm-based care denials can move forward. If it does, the suit (filed in 2023 following STAT\u2019s reports) could open the door for attorneys to sift through the company\u2019s internal communications, our Bob Herman reports. These kinds of big lawsuits can take years to make their way through the courts but, in this case, there\u2019s a sense of urgency \u2013 many of the alleged victims are elderly and ill.\n\nZach Baron, director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown\u2019s O\u2019Neill Institute, told Bob it\u2019s difficult to predict the outcome because of the scant legal precedent governing a technology like AI and a longstanding public benefit like Medicare. \u201cRegardless of what the judge decides here, it\u2019s not going to be the final word on this, just given where we are with the state of the law and new technologies,\u201d Baron said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nUnitedHealth has denied the allegations that its technology was the only basis for whether a patient received care. Get into the details, in Bob\u2019s story.\n\nSigns of life at the CDC\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report at the usual time yesterday after missing a few weeks. The reports \u2013 which disseminate key public health information and recommendations \u2013 have been trapped in a continuing communications freeze imposed by the Trump administration. Hearing \u201cthe voice of CDC\u201d after nearly a month indicates a slight thaw, but this new MMWR is a shadow of its former self. It includes just two \u201cNotes from the Field,\u201d briefs on the wildfires in Maui and L.A., respectively. Usually, MMWR includes three full studies.\n\nIn other signs of life at the agency, the CDC issued a health alert Thursday about the Ebola outbreak in Uganda, which is being caused by the Sudan virus. Vaccination efforts using an experimental vaccine could begin as early as this weekend. Keep up with the latest in global health here.\n\nA test of RSV antibodies in Spanish babies\n\nNew data from Spain show Beyfortus, the antibody injection that protects babies from RSV, was highly protective there during the first year of its rollout. Spain was one of the first countries to offer all babies the injection during their first RSV season.\n\nA case-control study showed that the injection was 80% effective at preventing hospitalizations for RSV in inoculated children when compared to kids who didn\u2019t get the shot. There was a similar effectiveness for more serious outcomes from RSV infection \u2014 ICU admissions and the need for mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe effectiveness of the long-acting monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab, \u201ctogether with its high coverage in Spain, have resulted in a substantial impact,\u201d and bodes well for similar campaigns in upcoming seasons, the researchers wrote in the online journal Eurosurveillance.

( ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nNew York City is embarking on an ambitious plan to slash chronic disease rates and extend lifespans on the local level. To do so, acting health commissioner Michelle Morse and her allies will try everything from providing basic income to \u201cprescribing parks\u201d for neighborhoods. STAT\u2019s Liz Cooney spoke to Morse about her roadmap.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIncreasing longevity is certainly an ambitious goal. How will you get there?\n\nThis report is not just about wagging our finger at New Yorkers and saying, \u201cEat healthy.\u201d It\u2019s about saying: How do we make it easy for all New Yorkers, no matter their economic patterns or level of poverty, to eat healthy foods and acknowledge that\u2026economic marginalization is a big driver of chronic disease?\n\nHow do you make change?\n\nWe have extensive data, literally by community district, by borough, by neighborhood \u2014 data that showed us exactly where we need to focus our resources. If I know that the rate of diabetes in the Bronx is two times that in other places, or that the rate of diabetes in high poverty neighborhoods is two times that in low poverty neighborhoods, that gives me a roadmap for exactly where I need to take my interventions.\n\nRead the full Q&A here.\n\nFirst Opinion: Inclusive clinical trials are imperative\n\nIf you tried to click on the main website for the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Diversity Action Plan guidelines in the past few weeks, you\u2019d hit this: \u201cPage Not Found.\u201d It\u2019s just one of many government sites that have gone down in recent days, some because of a Trump Executive Order banning diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The guidelines were set forth in 2022, and enacted by Congress in recognition of the need to improve diversity in clinical trials.\n\nAnd, in a First Opinion essay, former FDA collaborator Suzanne B. Robotti predicts the plan will come back to life \u2014 out of necessity. \u201cThe trials we looked at were overwhelmingly populated by white men,\u201d writes Robotti, who has been on over 20 FDA drug advisory committees and other panels. When they\u2019re not inclusive, trials become less useful, because medications may fail to address the unique needs of all patient subgroups.\n\nAnother funding stream dries up amid war on DEI\n\nThe latest blow to diversity in science and health inequities: This week, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute abruptly closed down a $60 million program aimed at retaining undergraduate STEM students. The decision came as a shock to the 104 institutions receiving funding through the program, called Inclusive Excellence, or IE3. Those colleges and universities used the money to improve introductory science courses, hire students in labs, create teaching resources, and more.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSome researchers \u2014 already rocked by the threat of federal funding cuts \u2014 had hoped philanthropic sources with deep pockets could help sustain them for the next four years. HHMI\u2019s retreat from the IE3 program suggests that may not happen, especially considering how vocal the institute had been about diversity in science, STAT\u2019s Anil Oza reports. Researchers he spoke with struck a somber tone, saying they were running out of options for where to turn for support on work that even mentions the word \u201cdiversity.\u201d Read more.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading",

United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States.

A doctor \u201cis using her social media following to perpetuate inaccuracies, which is irresponsible, unethical and dangerous,\u201d UnitedHeath said in a statement.\n\nThe hiring shows the biggest US health insurer is pushing back against public statements it views as false following the high-profile death of an executive. Clare Locke is best known for representing Dominion Voting Systems Inc. in a landmark $787.5 million defamation settlement with Fox Corp.'s Fox News.\n\nSocial media platforms lit up with criticisms and even hatred of health insurers following the Dec. 4 murder of Brian Thompson, the chief executive officer of the company\u2019s UnitedHealthcare unit, outside an investor conference in New York. Luigi Mangione, who had allegedly decried health industry practices, faces murder charges in Manhattan.\n\nElisabeth Potter, an Austin, Texas, plastic surgeon, claimed on Instagram Jan. 7 that UnitedHealth denied an in-patient stay after surgery related to cancer. \u201cI had to scrub out mid-surgery to call United, only to find that the person on the line didn\u2019t even have access to the patient\u2019s full medical information, despite the procedure already being pre-approved,\u201d Potter said in the post.\n\nOne of Potter\u2019s attorneys, Jessica Underwood, said Potter received a Jan. 13 letter from Clare Locke demanding that she correct her posts, apologize to UnitedHealth and condemn threats of violence that the law firm said resulted from the posts.\n\nBut Underwood, of the law firm Nix Patterson, said Potter\u2019s statements about the insurer were truthful. \u201cDr. Potter will not be silenced by UnitedHealthcare\u2019s attempts to threaten and harass her,\u201d Underwood said.\n\n\n\nUnitedHealth said in its statement that it had previously approved coverage of the care the patient received, including coverage of an overnight stay. \u201cDr. Potter\u2019s claims that she was called out of surgery are false,\u201d the company said. \u201cThere are no insurance related circumstances that would require a physician to step out of surgery and it would create potential safety risks if they were to do so.\u201d\n\nClare Locke\u2019s letter to Potter was signed by Tom Clare, who founded the firm in 2014 with his wife and former fellow Kirkland & Ellis partner Elizabeth \u201cLibby\u201d Locke.\n\nFirm partner Jered Ede also signed the letter. Before joining the firm, Ede served as chief legal officer for Project Veritas, the conservative nonprofit that goes undercover to expose what it sees as wrongdoing.\n\nThe 17-attorney Clare Locke has built a reputation for winning high-stakes defamation matters and often handles referrals from Big Law firms including Kirkland, McGuireWoods, Davis Polk & Wardwell, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.\n\nClare Locke did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The company also has 4.3 million members enrolled in Medicare supplement plans through UnitedHealthcare. It also has 3 million people enrolled in standalone Part D coverage.\n\nThompson\u2019s death and the possible motive behind his killing have drawn scrutiny to the health insurance sector, including reports of high claim denial rates by companies like UnitedHealth Group.\n\nUnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty acknowledged the pressure on the health insurance sector during the company\u2019s earnings call. The industry needs to be \u201cless confusing, less complex and less costly\u201d for patients, he said.\n\nMangione faces New York state charges along with federal charges. He also faces the potential of the death penalty if found guilty of first-degree murder on federal charges.\n\nMangione pleaded not guilty in New York on Dec. 23. He is expected to appear in federal court on Feb. 21.\n\nUNH, DIA Price Action: UnitedHealth stock is down 1.6% to $536.70 on Wednesday. Shares hit a daily low of $521.91 before recovering slightly.

The ETF is now up 0.3% on the day at the time of writing.\n\nUnitedHealth is the second largest holding in the Dow Jones ETF and the second largest weighting of the index, which weighs stocks by stock price and not market capitalization.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage created using artificial intelligence via Midjourney.",

Indeed, Ackman referenced a disturbing incident involving Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a Texas surgeon who alleges that UnitedHealthcare representatives interrupted her surgery to dispute her patient\u2019s hospital stay.

The company dismissed Ackman\u2019s allegations as \u201cgrossly uninformed\u201d and claimed that insurers cannot \u201cover-earn\u201d due to these regulatory constraints. A UnitedHealth spokesperson also revealed that the company had reached out to regulators regarding Ackman\u2019s post.\n\nDoes Bill Ackman Have a Short Position?\n\nAckman is unlikely to have a short position on UNH stock due to his history with short selling. Indeed, he previously made a disastrous bet against Herbalife (HLF) in 2012 that cost him over $1 billion on the trade. As a result, Ackman has since given up short selling, but his recent comments on UnitedHealth seem to have concerned some investors since he has had success shorting insurance companies in the past.\n\nWhat Is the Future of UNH Stock?\n\nOverall, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on UNH stock based on 20 Buys assigned in the past three months.

It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. It is the world\u2019s 7th largest company by revenue and the largest insurer by annual premiums. It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers. Regarding the environment, the company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 which is well ahead of the global target. The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States.

Rick Scott wants Luigi Mangione to receive the death penalty for allegedly shooting and killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\nThe Republican Senator from Florida calls for the extreme action In a clip exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com.\n\nThe reaction to Thompson's death was extremely polarizing among the political community, with liberals saying it points to Americans' unhappiness with U.S. healthcare and conservatives calling the murder an injustice against the system.\n\nScott, a former healthcare industry executive, said while Mangione, 26, has not been convicted of Thompson's murder, he does believe the death penalty would be justified if he is found guilty.\n\nHe said it's obvious that death should be the punishment due to the 'cold-blooded' nature of the murder and the obvious 'vendetta' held against the CEO.\n\n'Luigi Mangioni, in the beginning of December like you know, allegedly shot and killed United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan early morning,' Gabe Groisman said to Scott during an interview on an upcoming episode of his podcast Standpoint.\n\n'It was the way he was executed, it seemed obvious at that moment that the world would condemn him.'\n\n'There's been a big push at least in social media and the sort of younger generation trying to almost defend or excuse Mangioni because of the problems that he sees in the healthcare industry and the insurance industry, in particular,' Groisman noted.\n\nSen.

Groisman pressed.\n\n'I mean he's not been convicted yet, but it sure looks like it was just absolutely in cold blood and he just had a vendetta against him so at least that's what- what you read,' Scott said.\n\n'So if that's what happened, I mean clearly, you know [the death penalty] is clearly justified.'\n\nHe concluded: 'If somebody doesn't like the way the healthcare system is being delivered then get in the middle of it and change it \u2013 so that's the right way of doing it.'\n\nThe Florida senator co-founded Columbia Hospital Corporation, which later merged with another group to form Columbia/HCA. It became the nation's largest for-profit healthcare company.\n\nHCA \u2013 Hospital Corporation of America \u2013 remains the No. 1 largest hospital system in the U.S. by revenue.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, meanwhile, is the largest health insurance company in the U.S.\n\nMangione allegedly shot and killed Thompson on the street in midtown Manhattan in early December, leading to a city-wide and then nationwide manhunt.\n\nHe was apprehended days after the shooting at a McDonalds in Altoona, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe hand gun recovered from Mangione was made up of partially 3D-printed parts.\n\nBut it also donned metal components including the top slide of the gun and the barrel, which appeared to be threaded to allow for a suppressor or silencer to be attached to the forearm.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDuring a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it\u2019s crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends.\n\nDividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth.\n\nREAD ALSO: 8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in\n\nAccording to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan\u2019s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future.\n\nThe main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment.\n\nSince then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters.\n\nInvestors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it\u2019s not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is an American health insurance company, based in Minnesota. In 2024, the company encountered substantial challenges, including a $6 billion setback from Medical Cost Ratios (MCR) and the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on expensive medications. However, UnitedHealth\u2019s proactive steps, such as adjusting pricing strategies and continuing to invest in Medicare Advantage (MA), have allowed it to handle regulatory and market pressures more effectively. Moving into 2025, UNH plans to tackle these challenges by focusing on regulatory changes in MA, scaling AI-driven models, and enhancing operational efficiencies across its commercial and Medicare sectors. The stock has surged by over 6% in the past 12 months.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) recently revealed its FY24 earnings, exceeding investor expectations with an outstanding performance. It reported revenue of $400 billion, reflecting an 8% increase from the previous year, driven by expanded services throughout the organization. The company\u2019s operational earnings for the year reached $32.3 billion. After excluding expenses related to responding to a cyberattack and challenges in South America, adjusted operational earnings were $34.4 billion.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) met investor expectations with impressive cash flow results. For the full year, the company generated $24.2 billion in cash flows from operations, which is 1.6 times its net income. Throughout 2024, it returned over $16 billion to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. In Q4, its return on equity was 23.7%, showcasing strong earnings and an efficient capital structure.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) also has a solid dividend history, having started annual dividend payments in 1990 and moving to quarterly payouts in 2010. Since then, it has consistently raised its dividends, making it one of the top stocks for reliable dividends.

However, UnitedHealthcare agreed not to pull coverage for patients who were currently undergoing cancer treatment or who were in the middle of their pregnancies.\n\nDespite the continuity of care agreement with both the practice and its members, Axia said medical claims totaling roughly $1 million were denied by UnitedHealthcare for being \u201cout of network.\u201d In total, the practice reported 2,300 patients were forced to file appeals, which have so far gone unanswered.\n\nAccording to a report from NJ.com, UnitedHealthcare is blaming Axia, claiming the practice was billing for care at rates 30% higher than the market rate. The practice disagrees, adding that the insurer pays hospitals more for the same care, sometimes at rates 20% higher than what Axia is seeking.\n\nThe report estimates 60,000 people\u2014mostly women and maternity patients\u2014have been left without coverage due to the dispute. Many have reported being forced to delay care or miss appointments, while others have lamented unpaid bills. Some patients who spoke to NJ.com also claimed doctors at Axia were pushing unnecessary treatments, seemingly to boost revenue.\n\nDespite federal laws mandating that insurers honor continuity of care agreements, it remains unclear when this conflict will be resolved, given the facts have yet to be established and no lawsuit has been filed.\n\nFor more details, read the full report from NJ.com at the link below.",

In the hours after, panicked requests poured into security firms.\n\nSome companies are hiring armed security officers to help keep C-suite execs safe. Others are relying on technology for personal safety.\n\nThis surge in security requests came after a weekday morning murder in midtown Manhattan. Luigi Mangione now faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted of federal murder charges in the December 4th killing of United Healthcare's chief executive, Brian Thompson.\n\n\"There's such divisiveness in our country. People blame CEOs of companies, owners of banks, for almost everything. I am shocked though, that a CEO of a company didn't have security around him walking around the streets in New York City,\" retired Miami Beach police chief and V2 Global partner Donald De Lucca told the I-Team.\n\nThe execution-style killing triggered a flurry of calls to private security firms.\n\nREAD MORE: How Luigi Mangione's notebook helped federal prosecutors build their case against accused CEO killer\n\n\"We've seen our number of requests, for executive protection specifically, have definitely more than doubled since this has happened,\" said Evan Nardone, chief technology officer of St. Moritz Security Services.\n\nThe company operates in Chicago and 40 offices across the country.\n\n\"While we want to be helpful in these times of reaction, the key focus for us is, how do we help you become more prepared going forward,\" said Nardone.\n\nEven when security measures are in place, security teams tell the I-Team, sometimes execs ditch their protection.\n\n\"And those can be challenges as well, that you know, proving to someone that they need protection in times like these,\" Nardone told the I-Team.\n\nUnitedHealthcare CEO killing: Who is Mangione's 'veteran' New York lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo?\n\nBecause executive security is so sensitive, local C-suite execs we reached out to declined to talk about their security plans.\n\n\"It has forced the HR departments and safety departments in these companies to re-evaluate to what extent their employees are safe and secure,\" said Kuvrr President & CEO Sanjeev Arora.\n\nKuvrr is headquartered in Glenview.\n\nTheir technology can track people, valuable property; even food.\n\nOne organization's leader who uses Kuvrr's Safe Walk app allowed us to follow her during a walk near work.\n\n\"It's truly a virtual guard. The second you have any sense of safety concerns, you have somebody that's with you,\" said Kuvrr Vice President Scott Lorenz.\n\n\"We cover all three aspects of it, whether they are at their offices, at their home or in transit,\" said Arora.\n\nOther layers of security they can provide include satellite location coverage, panic buttons and access to emergency response plans. Kuvrr execs say they're able to share real time situational awareness during a crisis.\n\nFamilies are even using the technology for college students and aging parents.\n\n\"This is where our app and our panic button, which is very discreet, comes in handy,\" says Arora.\n\n\"I believe that it's just the beginning. We're going to see a proliferation of these security companies to protect high profile individuals,\" said former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine.\n\nThe entrepreneur tells the I-Team he still uses private security.\n\n\"It's not over the top. It usually is light, but it's enough to make sure, God forbid, if there is an incident or an attempt or whatever it may be, that you are adequately prepared,\" said Levine.\n\nDespite extra protection, some warn there is no way to be 100% secure.\n\n\"With as complex as our world is, there is no silver bullet. There's nothing that you can point to and say this will solve everything,\" said Nardone.\n\nSecurity experts say the threats are serious. A study found that more than half of the 300 companies they surveyed reported their CEO received physical threats.",

            "content": "N. Adam Brown is a practicing emergency physician, entrepreneur, and healthcare executive. He is the founder of ABIG Health, a healthcare growth strategy firm, and a professor at the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School. Follow\n\nHere is a hard truth for those of us who are care providers: Americans are unsatisfied with the country's healthcare system. It is not just about cost or lack of access. Gallup recently found only 44% of Americans think the quality of the care they get in this country is excellent or even good.\n\nHere is another hard truth: every one of us who is involved in the healthcare ecosystem bears some responsibility for this prevailing feeling -- and we must each do our part to solve it. From the doctor who doesn't even glance up from charts to look a patient in the eye to the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who manipulate prescription drug prices, it is time to recognize these hard truths and take decisive action toward reform.\n\nUnfortunately, Sir Andrew Witty, British business executive and CEO of UnitedHealth Group, appears to think insurers bear no blame for Americans' discontent. In recent comments to investors in the wake of the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Witty essentially absolved UnitedHealthcare of any insurer's role in the dissatisfaction plaguing the U.S. healthcare system. While acknowledging healthcare costs are significantly higher than in other countries, Witty seemed to lay the blame squarely on the cost of care -- prescription drugs, hospital procedures, and physician services -- without acknowledging UnitedHealthcare's role in this broken system. (Interestingly, Witty was previously CEO of pharma giant GSK.)\n\nMake no mistake: insurers are certainly one reason Americans are angry.\n\nProfits Over People\n\nWitty talked about the growing costs of healthcare while on the earnings call -- an earnings call that made plain how much Witty and his company are raking in. Specifically, as Axios spelled out, UnitedHealth Group posted revenue of $400.3 billion for 2024, up 7.8% from 2023.\n\nEarnings were down, but that appears mostly due to the cyberattack against UnitedHealth's Change Healthcare in the first half of last year, wreaking havoc for hospitals, doctors' offices, and patients. Even so, as Healthcare Dive reported, excluding the cyberattack costs and other factors that UnitedHealth believes were not representative of its overall business performance in the year, the company reported an adjusted profit of $25.7 billion, which was an all-time record. Additionally, by the fourth quarter, revenue had increased 6.8% year-over-year to $100.8 billion and net earnings were up 1.6% from a year earlier to $5.5 billion.\n\nAs Axios wrote, the company's \"profits are still large enough, though, to rank among America's 25 most profitable companies.\"\n\nThe massive scale of UnitedHealth Group's revenue is due to its ability to operate as a massively consolidated, vertically integrated organization that touches nearly every corner of the healthcare value chain. From employing the largest group of clinicians (Optum) in the country to owning one of the largest PBMs (OptumRx), UnitedHealthcare plays a pivotal role in determining costs and shaping patient experiences -- and outcomes.\n\nFailing to Hear Americans' Frustrations\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Thompson's murder, Witty failed to connect with Americans who, while condemning the murder, understood how frustrating it is to deal with health insurance companies. Back in December, Witty also seemingly played the blame game in an internal video message for employees.\n\nWitty's more recent statement that \"healthcare costs more in the U.S. because the price of a single procedure, visit, or prescription is higher here than it is in other countries\" is accurate -- but it is also incomplete. Time and time again, he fails to publicly address the frustration patients feel when their care is delayed or denied due to prior authorizations, restrictive networks, or unreasonable claims denials -- all hallmark behaviors of the health insurance industry.\n\nWe should also consider UnitedHealth Group's role in perpetuating the myth that PBMs help alleviate drug costs for patients. A Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report issued mid-January examined the practices of the country's three largest PBMs: CVS Health's Caremark Rx, Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx. According to the report, these organizations marked up the prices of many specialty generic drugs by hundreds or thousands of percent, helping to generate more than $7.3 billion in revenue for the PBMs and their affiliated specialty pharmacies between 2017 and 2022.\n\n$7.3 billion. That's more than the GDP of some small countries.\n\nWhat's more, these companies have a corner on the market. In 2023, the firms examined by the FTC received 68% of all dispensing revenue generated by specialty drugs in the U.S.\n\nThe January report was the FTC's second on PBMs. The first study, released mid-2024, found that, instead of helping keep healthcare costs down, PBMs steer patients toward more expensive drugs and, incredibly, even overcharge for cancer treatments.\n\nAnd, yet, Witty shows no remorse and no willingness to drive change.\n\nTime for Insurers to Take Ownership\n\nUnitedHealth Group cannot ignore these issues. Shifting blame to providers, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies is disingenuous, particularly given that the company itself employs many of those providers and controls major portions of the drug supply chain.\n\nIf members of the healthcare ecosystem want to change Americans' attitudes, we need all stakeholders to take responsibility for their role in our systemic healthcare challenges -- not just point fingers elsewhere.\n\nIt is time for a real conversation about improving affordability, access, and patient satisfaction without the hollow rhetoric. Let's keep pushing for a better, more equitable healthcare system. Patients and clinicians deserve better than what we have right now.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. It is the world\u2019s 7th largest company by revenue and the largest insurer by annual premiums. It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers. Regarding the environment, the company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 which is well ahead of the global target. The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump\u2019s trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows:\n\n\u201cEverything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets\u201d\n\nRecently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI\u2019s, Google\u2019s, or Meta\u2019s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build.\n\nThe event raised a lot of concerns over America\u2019s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers, as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China\u2019s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple\u2019s App Store demonstrates the country\u2019s rapid gains in the sector.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a health care and well-being company that strives to make health care work better through two distinct businesses, Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\n\nWith the aforementioned diversified and complimentary businesses, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reinforces its strong market position in the health services industry. Value-based care is core to UNH\u2019s mission which is proven to drive better health outcomes at a lower cost and hence, UNH serves people in value-based care in dozens of geographies. The healthcare company is laying a foundation to pave the way for more people to benefit from integrated, patient-centered care and bringing innovation to the entire healthcare system through its five strategic growth priorities including care delivery, health benefits, health technology, financial services, and pharmacy care.\n\nThe firm showed diversified growth in serving people more extensively at the Optum and UnitedHealthcare businesses as it closed 2024. 2024 revenues grew 8% year-over-year. While domestic consumers catered to by UnitedHealthcare grew 2.1 million, value-based care patients served by Optum grew 600,000. UNH is positioned well for growth in 2025, making high-quality and affordable healthcare more accessible as well as deeming the health system easier to navigate for patients and providers.\n\nOverall UNH ranks 10th on our list of the best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds.

Molly Adams from USA, CC BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBy Chris Mills Rodrigo / OtherWords\n\nHealth care is big business in the United States. So big it can be hard to wrap your head around.\n\nAmerica\u2019s largest health care company, the UnitedHealth Group, pulled in over $100 billion in revenue in just the fourth quarter of 2024 alone. For the full year, the giant\u2019s insurance division, UnitedHealthcare, just reported record revenue of $298.2 billion.\n\nThese staggering revenue totals actually fell below investor expectations. Right after the announcement, UnitedHealth Group shares slipped 6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThat tells you a lot about what\u2019s important in the healthcare industry: profit, not care. Health insurance companies in particular can only profit by paying out less in claims than they collect in premiums. And that means denying patients coverage for the care they need.\n\nJust outside the New York Stock Exchange, victims of our for-profit healthcare system \u2014 doctors and patients alike \u2014 recently braved freezing temperatures to call out the suffering that engineered UnitedHealth\u2019s exorbitant earnings.\n\nOne of those demonstrators, Jenn Coffey, has been battling complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a condition so incredibly painful that it\u2019s often called the \u201csuicide disease.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth denied her the prior authorization needed to have her critically important treatment adequately covered. \u201cUnitedHealthcare would rather leave me in torture than grant me the peace my infusions bring,\u201d says Coffey. \u201cI\u2019m asking for a life worth dignity. I\u2019m left begging for a life worth living.\u201d\n\nSeveral other speakers shared their deeply personal experiences with a health care system that far too often treats patients as disposable.\n\nDr. Toutou Moussa Diallo, a New York-based researcher and health care activist, detailed how insurance denials led to subpar treatment for his broken ankle that only made the initial injury more debilitating. Nephrologist Cheryl Kunis shared the story of a patient who died after UnitedHealthcare refused to cover a PET scan of a malignant neck tumor.\n\nThese experiences amount to much more than isolated one-off incidents. The outpouring of anger after the December killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson \u2014 anger not at the shooting but at the company Thompson represented \u2014 shows just how many Americans are currently suffering under our privatized health care system.\n\nThe ongoing campaign protesting how UnitedHealth does business began well before Thompson\u2019s headline-grabbing killing. The Care Over Cost mobilization, led by People\u2019s Action, has been organizing rallies protesting America\u2019s biggest private insurers for years.\n\nUnitedHealth has \u2014 for good reason \u2014 become the most powerful lightning rod for patient and medical staff critiques of how private insurers operate. The company\u2019s gargantuan profits rest on decisions that regularly exploit patients at every opportunity.\n\nJust a few snippets from recent news accounts offer a vivid picture about how UnitedHealth goes about making its billions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s pharmacy benefit manager, Optum RX, marked up some cancer treatments by over 1,000 percent. UnitedHealthcare systematically limited access to critical treatments for children with autism to cut costs. And along with two other insurers, the company intentionally denied nursing care to patients covered by Medicare Advantage \u2014 all to maximize profit.\n\nAnd how has the UnitedHealth Group been spending all its ill-gotten gains? One telling stat: UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty pocketed an astonishing $23.5 million in 2023 compensation.\n\nAs the rally in front of the New York Stock Exchange ended, protesters called on UnitedHealthcare to publicly release its claim denial rates, oppose federal tax cuts that would result in Medicaid service reductions, and end the company\u2019s care-denying prior authorization requirements.\n\nThose eminently reasonable demands for the company. Meanwhile, the rest of us should consider whether we want health care to be a tool for the public good \u2014 or just private profit.\n\nPlease share this story and help us grow our network!\n\nChris Mills Rodrigo Chris Mills Rodrigo is the managing editor of Inequality.org.\n\nAuthor Site\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

            "content": "Massive Healthcare Data Breach Affects 190 Million Americans UnitedHealth's Change Healthcare tops the record as largest medical data breach to date, raising urgent cybersecurity concerns.\n\n2024 will be remembered as a catastrophic year for healthcare data security, with unprecedented breaches leaving millions of American patients vulnerable. At the forefront of this disturbing trend was UnitedHealth's Change Healthcare subsidiary, whose extensive data breach emerged as the most significant incident in U.S. history. Initially reported on February 21, 2024, it was estimated to have impacted approximately 100 million individuals. Yet, by January 24, 2025, the company revealed the reality was far worse, affecting around 190 million people\u2014almost half the U.S. population.\n\nThis staggering reality was unveiled during various congressional hearings and directly through UnitedHealth\u2019s communications, drawing attention to the grave vulnerabilities within the healthcare sector. The breach, orchestrated by ALPHV/BlackCat, a notorious ransomware group, triggered extensive chaos across the healthcare sector. It caused widespread disruptions, with systems taken offline to contain the malicious attack, thereby impairing claims processing, payment systems, and data sharing integral to countless healthcare providers.\n\nAccording to reports from CyberGuy, the compromised data encompassed sensitive personal and medical information, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, email addresses, and even health-related details such as diagnoses and medications. The ramifications of this breach extend beyond immediate identity theft threats; they raise alarming concerns about how comprehensively personal information can be exploited\u2014leading to potential discrimination and health risks.\n\nUnitedHealth's CEO, Andrew Witty, had suggested during his testimony earlier this year, \"It is absolutely unacceptable for breaches of this magnitude to happen, and we will do everything we can to bolster our security measures moving forward.\" This quote underscored the industry's urgent need for system enhancements, particularly emphasizing stronger cybersecurity protocols during data handling.\n\nBeyond the Change Healthcare breach, 2024 witnessed 184 million healthcare records being breached across the country, marking 53% of the U.S. population. This alarming statistic demonstrated not only the growing prevalence of such incidents but also highlighted the pressing cybersecurity challenges healthcare institutions face. Alongside UnitedHealth, there was the breach of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, affecting around 13.4 million individuals, showcasing just how widespread and serious the problem has become.\n\nPatients who found themselves caught up amid these breaches faced the stress of potential identity theft. Medical identity theft can have dire consequences, including creating false medical records, thereby leading to incorrect treatments and significant financial repercussions\u2014but the psychological toll cannot be overlooked either. A study cited by several sources indicated up to 54% of affected patients contemplated switching providers after experiencing data breaches, signaling the potential long-term effects on patient trust within the healthcare system.\n\nOne worrying aspect identified within Change Healthcare\u2019s security revelations was the absence of standard security measures\u2014specifically, the lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) to safeguard sensitive information. Such gaps not only expose patients to risks but also put healthcare providers' operational integrity at stake, prompting voices within the industry to call for legislative reforms aimed at tightening data security regulations.\n\nFor individuals affected by these breaches, expert recommendations suggest proactive measures to safeguard personal information. These include setting social media profiles to private, regularly monitoring bank accounts and credit reports, and utilizing identity theft protection services. Services like Identity Guard can offer monitoring and alerts if personal information is found on the dark web, and may also provide fraud resolution assistance and insurance coverage for losses.\n\nMonitoring personal information and data actively has never been more imperative. For patients, who have already suffered disruption and anxiety from the initial breach, the road ahead necessitates vigilance. They are encouraged to recognize potential scams resulting from the disclosed information\u2014such as phishing attempts or fraudulent communications using their ID details\u2014ensuring they remain alert to any unsolicited contact.\n\nThe significance of these breaches serves as both a cautionary tale and call to action for the healthcare industry. Stricter policies, enhanced security infrastructure, and more extensive use of advanced technology will be required to mitigate such risks moving forward. Otherwise, millions of patients will remain at risk, grappling with the fallout of breaches they had no hand in, yet bearing the consequences.\n\nThe healthcare sector must rise to the challenge, addressing the glaring vulnerabilities exposed by these breaches. Do healthcare companies have enough measures to protect patient data? Only time and action will tell if they can secure trust and safeguard against future threats.",

Ultimately, the family argues, that oligopoly led to their son's death at just 22 years old last January.\n\nAs the Schmidtknects told WMTV previously, their son had had asthma since he was an infant, but the advent of Advair's preventative Diskus inhaler had been \"life-changing\" for managing his symptoms.\n\nDuring the autumn prior to his death, the lawsuit explains, Optum changed its policies for the upcoming year and stopped carrying Advair Diskus or one of its generic alternatives, instead covering two newer and more expensive options. In doing so, the PBM was able to make more money.\n\n\"This practice of requiring patients to change their medications so that the PBM can collect kickbacks from the drug manufacturer is called 'non-medical switching,'\" the suit expounds, \"because the choice of medication is dictated by the PBM\u2019s financial interests, not the best medical interests of\n\npatients.\"\n\nWhen the younger Schmidtknect went to get his inhaler at the beginning of 2024, he was informed of the price increase \u2014 800 percent higher than its previous price \u2014 and essentially told the pharmacist to kick rocks.\n\n\"He walked out,\" Schmidtknect's father told WMTV last November. \"Chose rent over his medicine.\"\n\nJust a few days after refusing to pay for that expensive prescription, the 22-year-old had a severe asthma attack. Because he didn't have his inhaler, his parents say, it was fatal.\n\nInitially, the young man's parents didn't know that his prescription had become that expensive \u2014 until his dad got the bill for his own, similar inhaler and saw the cost.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, this is what happened,\" Shannon Schmidtknecht recalled. \"This is what happened to Cole.\"\n\nThough the family had been outspoken about their son's death and its link to PBMs prior to the murder of UHC CEO Brian Thompson in December, the timing of their suit filing in the aftermath of that assassination \u2014 and the anger it unleashed at the insurance industry in response \u2014 is striking.\n\nWith the lawsuit, the grieving family is looking to draw attention to the alleged inequity promoted by these drug middlemen.\n\n\"It\u2019s just this unknown creature out there that\u2019s controlling care,\" William Schmidtknect told the local broadcaster last fall.\n\nAfter the suit was filed earlier in the week, an OptumRx spokesperson \u2014 who asked for anonymity in the wake of Thompson's death \u2014 responded with a boilerplate message of condolences.\n\n\"Mr. Schmidtknecht\u2019s death was tragic, and our thoughts are with his family,\" the spokesperson told WMTV. \"The claims made are factually inaccurate.\"\n\nMore on UHC: UnitedHealthcare's New CEO Announcement Draws a Frenzy of Dark Humor",

This incident has underscored the market\u2019s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nFor example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits.

We want to clarify that this was not a raid, and no patients were the target of the visit.\"\n\nThe medical group won't give details on the interaction with agents but go on to say they are committed to protecting the rights and privacy of their patients and they remain steadfast in upholding their legal and ethical obligation to the people they serve.\n\n\"People hear the rumors that everybody is going to get deported and so, they're not going to school or they're maybe not going to work and that is tragic,\" said ABC 30 political analyst and former Congresswoman Connie Conway.\n\nThe former congresswoman said there could be immigrants that get caught in the crossfire of targeted deportations, but she doesn't believe that's the intention behind President Trump's executive order and hopes that doesn't happen.\n\n\"The criminal element that has happened with the open border is really the problem. You hear about all the murders, the rapes, other horrible things that have happened by criminals. It's not the immigrants that wanna come here to work,\" said Conway.\n\nConway hopes for better legislation that helps undocumented immigrants, who don't have a criminal history, attain the American Dream.\n\nAction News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment regarding these recent sightings. We have yet to hear back.\n\nFor news updates, follow Vince Ybarra on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a multinational, Minnetonka, Minnesota-based healthcare and insurance company. It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. It is the world\u2019s 7th largest company by revenue and the largest insurer by annual premiums. It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers. Regarding the environment, the company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 which is well ahead of the global target. The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

            "content": "A company\u2019s long-term sales performance signals its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, UnitedHealth\u2019s 10.6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was decent. Its growth was slightly above the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\n\nUpfront premiums collected by health insurers lead to reliable revenue, but profitability ultimately depends on accurate risk assessments and the ability to control medical costs. Health insurers are also highly sensitive to regulatory changes and economic conditions such as unemployment. Going forward, the industry faces tailwinds from an aging population, increasing demand for personalized healthcare services, and advancements in data analytics to improve cost management. However, continued regulatory scrutiny on pricing practices, the potential for government-led reforms such as expanded public healthcare options, and inflation in medical costs could add volatility to margins. One big debate among investors is the long-term impact of AI and whether it will help underwriting, fraud detection, and claims processing or whether it may wade into ethical grey areas like reinforcing biases and widening disparities in medical care.\n\n\u201cThe people of UnitedHealth Group remain focused on making high-quality, affordable health care more available to more people while making the health system easier to navigate for patients and providers, positioning us well for growth in 2025,\u201d said Andrew Witty, Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group.\n\nFree Cash Flow was $1.46 billion, up from -$6.15 billion in the same quarter last year\n\nIs now the time to buy UnitedHealth? Find out in our full research report .\n\nHealth insurance company UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2024, but sales rose 6.8% year on year to $100.8 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $6.81 per share was 1.1% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nUnitedHealth Quarterly Revenue\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. UnitedHealth\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 11.1% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was stable.\n\nUnitedHealth Year-On-Year Revenue Growth\n\nUnitedHealth also reports its number of customers, which reached 53.73 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, UnitedHealth neither added nor lost customers. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the average customer spent more money each year on the company\u2019s products and services.\n\nUnitedHealth Customers\n\nThis quarter, UnitedHealth\u2019s revenue grew by 6.8% year on year to $100.8 billion, missing Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\n\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 13% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is particularly healthy for a company of its scale and suggests its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n\nAdjusted operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. It also removes various one-time costs to paint a better picture of normalized profits.\n\nUnitedHealth was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average adjusted operating margin of 8.6% was weak for a healthcare business.\n\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, UnitedHealth\u2019s adjusted operating margin might have seen some fluctuations but has generally stayed the same over the last five years, which doesn\u2019t help its cause.\n\nUnitedHealth Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (Non-GAAP)\n\nIn Q4, UnitedHealth generated an adjusted operating profit margin of 8.2%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s EPS grew at a spectacular 12.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 10.6% annualized revenue growth. However, this alone doesn\u2019t tell us much about its business quality because its adjusted operating margin didn\u2019t expand.\n\nUnitedHealth Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP)\n\nWe can take a deeper look into UnitedHealth\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. A five-year view shows that UnitedHealth has repurchased its stock, shrinking its share count by 2.9%. This tells us its EPS outperformed its revenue not because of increased operational efficiency but financial engineering, as buybacks boost per share earnings.\n\nUnitedHealth Diluted Shares Outstanding\n\nIn Q4, UnitedHealth reported EPS at $6.81, up from $6.16 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 1.1%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects UnitedHealth\u2019s full-year EPS of $27.67 to grow 7.4%.\n\nKey Takeaways from UnitedHealth\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results as its EPS was in line and its revenue fell slightly short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter.\n\nUnitedHealth didn\u2019t show it\u2019s best hand this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to buy the stock right now? When making that decision, it\u2019s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it\u2019s free.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth\u2019s Change Healthcare unit suffered a data breach in February 2024, the news of which surfaced on February 21. Initially reported to have affected around 100 million individuals, the U.S. health insurance giant has now revealed that the actual number is significantly higher \u2013 190 million. This makes it the largest breach of medical data in U.S. history, impacting nearly half the country\u2019s population. A breach of this magnitude can have devastating consequences for the American people, as malicious actors could exploit the data for a range of attacks if it finds its way to the dark web.\n\nThe updated impact assessment\n\nUnitedHealth confirmed on Friday, January 24, 2025, that the ransomware attack on its Change Healthcare unit affected approximately 190 million people in the United States. The company had previously estimated the number of affected individuals to be around 100 million in its preliminary analysis filed with the Office for Civil Rights, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that investigates data breaches.\n\nUnitedHealth stated that the majority of those impacted have already been notified, either directly or through substitute notice. The final tally of affected individuals will be confirmed and submitted to the Office for Civil Rights at a later date.\n\nThe company tells CyberGuy it is \u201cnot aware of any misuse of individuals\u2019 information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis.\u201d However, UnitedHealth did not disclose when it became aware of the additional 90 million victims, how the revised figure was determined, or what changes led to the updated number.\n\nTHE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nWhat you need to know about the data breach\n\nThe cyberattack on Change Healthcare in February caused widespread disruptions across the U.S. healthcare sector, as the company took its systems offline to contain the breach. This shutdown impacted critical services such as claims processing, payments, and data sharing, which many healthcare providers rely on.\n\nThe stolen data varied by individual but included a broad range of personal and sensitive information, such as names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and government ID numbers, including Social Security, driver\u2019s license, and passport details.\n\nPlus, hackers may have accessed health-related information, including diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging records, care and treatment plans, and health insurance details. Financial and banking information tied to claims and payment data was also reportedly compromised.\n\nThe breach was the result of a ransomware attack carried out by ALPHV/BlackCat, a Russian-speaking ransomware and extortion group. The attack, a form of malware intrusion, locks victims out of their data unless a ransom is paid. ALPHV/BlackCat later took credit for the attack.\n\nDuring a House hearing in April, Change Healthcare admitted that the breach was made possible due to inadequate security measures, specifically the absence of two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect its systems.\n\nFROM TIKTOK TO TROUBLE: HOW YOUR ONLINE DATA CAN BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST YOU\n\n6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach\n\n1) Remove your personal information from the internet: The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\n\nA service like Incogni can help you remove all this personal information from the internet. It has a very clean interface and will scan 195 websites for your information and remove it and keep it removed.\n\nSpecial for CyberGuy Readers (60% off): Incogni offers A 30-day money-back guarantee and then charges a special CyberGuy discount only through the links in this article of $5.99/month for one person (billed annually) or $13.19/month for your family (up to 4 people) on their annual plan and get a fully automated data removal service, including recurring removal from 190+ data brokers. You can add up to 3 emails, 3 home addresses and 3 phone numbers (U.S. citizens only) and have them removed from data-broker databases. I recommend the family plan because it works out to only $4.12 per person per month for year-round coverage. It\u2019s an excellent service, and I highly recommend at least trying it out to see what it\u2019s all about.\n\nGet Incogni here\n\nGet Incogni for your family (up to 4 people) here\n\n2) Be wary of mailbox communications: With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming missed deliveries, account suspensions, or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.\n\n3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\n\nMy top pick is TotalAV, and you can get a limited-time deal for CyberGuy readers: $19 your first year (80% off) for the TotalAV Antivirus Pro package.\n\nGet my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.\n\n4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements, and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.\n\n5) Recognize and report a Social Security scam: If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s scam information page.\n\n6) Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected.\n\nWhile there are many services that you can sign up for, my top recommendation is Identity Guard. It can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\n\nOne of the best parts of using Identity Guard is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to 1 million dollars to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a US-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\n\nCyberGuy\u2019s Exclusive Offer (66% off): Get the Identity Guard Ultra protection to protect your identity and credit for as little as $9.99/mo (lowest offered anywhere) for the first year.\n\nSee my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.\n\nMASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC\n\nKurt\u2019s key takeaway\n\nIt\u2019s surprising that a company of UnitedHealth\u2019s scale failed to implement even basic cybersecurity measures when handling customer data. A breach affecting 190 million people\u2014nearly half of the U.S. population\u2014is staggering, leaving almost anyone at risk of becoming a target for hackers. While the company is still assessing the full extent of the breach, you can take precautions now by being cautious with any unknown links or unsolicited calls. Bad actors may use a variety of tactics to cause harm.\n\nDo you think these companies are doing enough to protect your data, and is the government doing enough to catch those behind cyberattacks?

            "content": "Health care is big business in the United States. So big it can be hard to wrap your head around.\n\nAmerica\u2019s largest health care company, the UnitedHealth Group, pulled in over $100 billion in revenue in just the fourth quarter of 2024 alone. For the full year, the giant\u2019s insurance division, UnitedHealthcare, just reported record revenue of $298.2 billion.\n\nThese staggering revenue totals actually fell below investor expectations. Right after the announcement, UnitedHealth Group shares slipped 6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThat tells you a lot about what\u2019s important in the health care industry: profit, not care. Health insurance companies in particular can only profit by paying out less in claims they collect in premiums. And that means denying patients coverage for the care they need.\n\nJust outside the New York Stock Exchange, victims of our for-profit healthcare system \u2014 doctors and patients alike \u2014 recently braved freezing temperatures to call out the suffering that engineered UnitedHealth\u2019s exorbitant earnings.\n\nOne of those demonstrators, Jenn Coffey, has been battling complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a condition so incredibly painful that it\u2019s often called the \u201csuicide disease.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth denied her the prior authorization needed to have her critically important treatment adequately covered. \u201cUnitedHealthcare would rather leave me in torture than grant me the peace my infusions bring,\u201d says Coffey. \u201cI\u2019m asking for a life worth dignity. I\u2019m left begging for a life worth living.\u201d\n\nSeveral other speakers shared their deeply personal experiences with a health care system that far too often treats patients as disposable.\n\nDr. Toutou Moussa Diallo, a New York-based researcher and health care activist, detailed how insurance denials led to subpar treatment for his broken ankle that only made the initial injury more debilitating. Nephrologist Cheryl Kunis shared the story of a patient who died after UnitedHealthcare refused to cover a PET scan of a malignant neck tumor.\n\nThese experiences amount to much more than isolated one-off incidents. The outpouring of anger after the December killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson \u2014 anger not at the shooting but at the company Thompson represented \u2014 shows just how many Americans are currently suffering under our privatized health care system.\n\nThe ongoing campaign protesting how UnitedHealth does business began well before Thompson\u2019s headline-grabbing killing. The Care Over Cost mobilization, led by People\u2019s Action, has been organizing rallies protesting America\u2019s biggest private insurers for years.\n\nUnitedHealth has \u2014 for good reason \u2014 become the most powerful lightning rod for patient and medical staff critiques of how private insurers operate. The company\u2019s gargantuan profits rest on decisions that regularly exploit patients at every opportunity.\n\nJust a few snippets from recent news accounts offer a vivid picture about how UnitedHealth goes about making its billions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s pharmacy benefit manager, Optum RX, marked up some cancer treatments by over 1,000 percent. UnitedHealthcare systematically limited access to critical treatments for children with autism to cut costs. And along with two other insurers, the company intentionally denied nursing care to patients covered by Medicare Advantage \u2014 all to maximize profit.\n\nAnd how has the UnitedHealth Group been spending all its ill-gotten gains? One telling stat: UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty pocketed an astonishing $23.5 million in 2023 compensation.\n\nAs the rally in front of the New York Stock Exchange ended, protesters called on UnitedHealthcare to publicly release its claim denial rates, oppose federal tax cuts that would result in Medicaid service reductions, and end the company\u2019s care-denying prior authorization requirements.\n\nThose eminently reasonable demands for the company. Meanwhile, the rest of us should consider whether we want health care to be a tool for the public good \u2014 or just private profit.",

            "content": "The number of victims impacted by the Change Healthcare data breach last year has nearly doubled, from 100 million to approximately 190 million, parent company UnitedHealth Group told TechCrunch last week.\n\nIn an email to CNET, the health insurer said, \"The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice.\" A final number of impacted victims will be reported to the Office for Civil Rights at a later date.\n\nWhat caused the Change Healthcare data breach?\n\nUnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty testified before Congress in May that a hacker group gained unauthorized access to the company's servers by obtaining an employee's login credentials. The bad actors then used the stolen credentials to log in to an application to remotely access desktops. Witty said the employee didn't have multifactor authentication enabled on the app.\n\nThe attack disrupted medical services across the country, impacting medical claims processing, payment platforms and pharmacy network services.\n\nChange Healthcare, a UnitedHealth subsidiary and all-in-one health insurance technology provider that manages payments, claims processing and more, experienced a cyberattack in February 2024.\n\nImpacted individuals, however, weren't limited to UnitedHealth policyholders. Change Healthcare, which works with many health insurance carriers, including Aetna, Anthem, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Cigna, has access to highly sensitive data of a massive quantity of users in the health care system.\n\nDuring the same May hearing, Witty warned Congress that about one-third of Americans' data may have been compromised in the cyberattack. That number has seemingly increased to nearly one in every two Americans.\n\nWhat personal information was compromised?\n\nWhile UnitedHealth can't specify what data was compromised for each individual, a notice on its website said that the data could include Social Security and passport numbers, patient diagnoses, medical records, billing information and health insurance plan data.\n\nUnitedHealth Group began notifying impacted individuals in July of 2024 and has since sent notifications to more than 100 million people who were affected. If you received one of these notifications, your data might have been compromised. You can call 1-866-262-5342 for additional support.\n\nIf you didn't receive a notification, be advised that Change Healthcare's notice states: \"Given the ongoing nature and complexity of the data review, agents will not be able to provide any specifics on individual data impacted at this time.\"\n\nWhat to do if your information was stolen in the Change Healthcare breach\n\nChange Healthcare has a FAQ support page for people who may have been impacted by the breach. The company is offering IDX identity theft protection for up to two years. You can enroll on this page or call 1-888-846-4705 to sign up.\n\nIf the Change Healthcare breach impacted you, there are a number of other actions you should take to protect your identity:\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Check your health care policy for any changes. If there are any errors or health care claims you don't recognize, contact your health plan provider or your doctor's office.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Check your credit reports. Review your credit reports regularly and look for unrecognized credit applications and new medical debt reports.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Monitor your bank accounts. The breach compromised billing and payment information, so monitor your credit and bank statements for suspicious activity.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Freeze your credit reports. Beyond just checking your credit reports, you might opt to freeze your credit reports with the three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and Transunion. Putting a freeze on your credit prevents any new credit from being approved.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Sign up for identity theft services. After your two free years of IDX coverage expires, consider signing up for continued identity theft protection. These services can help monitor your bank and credit reports for you. They can also provide alerts when your data is found on the dark web as a result of future breaches. In the event your identity is stolen, identity theft services will provide insurance for any monetary expenses you might incur.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best big name stocks to invest in now.\n\nBig name stocks refer to well-known companies that are widely recognized and have a significant presence in the stock market. These companies are often industry leaders and are included in major stock indices such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Nasdaq Composite. These companies are characterized by their large market capitalizations, stable financial performance, and strong brand recognition.\n\nIn an interview on January 22, Dave Sekera, US Market Strategist at Morningstar, provided a detailed outlook for large-cap stocks in 2025. Sekera highlighted that the performance of large-cap stocks in 2024 was particularly strong, driven by several key factors. The explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and platforms, especially in the first half of 2024, significantly boosted the performance of large-cap tech stocks. Additionally, the US economy remained resilient, with faster-than-expected growth, which supported the performance of large-cap stocks. The Federal Reserve\u2019s easing of monetary policy also played a crucial role in driving the market higher.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Hedge Funds and 10 Worst Performing Energy Stocks in 2024.\n\nHowever, Sekera noted that the rate of monetary policy easing is now slowing, and the market is pricing in fewer rate cuts this year than originally projected. This, combined with sticky inflation and a rise in long-term interest rates, suggests that the tailwinds that supported large-cap stocks in 2024 are beginning to recede.\n\nFurthermore, Sekera pointed out that the concentration of market returns in 2024 was notable, with 10 stocks accounting for 58% of the market gain, despite representing only 30% of the market capitalization. This concentration is less than the 67% peak in June 2024, indicating a broadening of returns in the second half of the year. Despite this broadening, many of these large-cap stocks, particularly those tied to AI, are now trading at significant premiums. Sekera advised investors to be cautious, as very few of these large-cap stocks are currently undervalued, with most trading at 2-star or 1-star ratings, indicating they are overvalued.\n\nBig name stocks remain a compelling investment choice, offering stability, strong financial performance, and long-term growth potential.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a multinational, Minnetonka, Minnesota-based healthcare and insurance company. It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. It is the world\u2019s 7th largest company by revenue and the largest insurer by annual premiums. It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers. Regarding the environment, the company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 which is well ahead of the global target. The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\n\nIn the episode of CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired on the day of the DeepSeek stock market selloff, Jim Cramer mentioned the risks that utility companies had talked to him about when it came to investing in power generation. Energy stocks were among the hardest hit during the selloff due to earlier investor optimism about the high power demand from AI. Cramer shared \"Well look . . .a bunch of utilities behind the scenes have been telling me, we would like to spend. But what happens if something comes out Carl, that doesn't burn as hot. Then they would have spent a fortune and they don't want to go rate payer versus data center. They didn't want to make that trade-off. And today I think that the AIPs of the world, the American Electric Powers, they may actually catch a nice bid.\"\n\nOne concern that co-host David Faber raised during the program was DeepSeek having access to large amounts of data, including the entire Gmail account used to sign up for the service. In response, Cramer shared that he had been trying to cancel his service during the break. \"But they have everything,\" he added. He mentioned the amount of time that he'd spent on TikTok and DeepSeek and wondered if he would be able to remove his DeepSeek account if he said \"that I love Mao? Would that help me? I think Mao was a great man and should've gotten the Nobel Peace Prize. What would help me at this point? That Tiananmen Square was a great celebration? What do I do? Tell me what to do?\"\n\nThe primary reason stocks shed billions of dollars on Monday was that investors wondered if companies would have to spend billions of dollars to set up AI platforms. However, Cramer argued that the argument that some firms might see an ROI improvement from lower costs was very important. He listed the beneficiaries of AI and stated \"We have so many beneficiaries, now we have a healthcare rotation going on, we have the beneficiaries that have really been hamstrung. We have the notion like the Justice Department said under the previous President, there's been too much concentration.\"\n\nCommenting on the environment as the market fell Cramer shared \"Look I do think it's a moment, Carl, where all of us were talking, like it was when we first discovered ChatGPT, and we were playing Haiku.\" Yet, he remained skeptical about the accuracy of the data surrounding DeepSeek and R-1. According to Cramer \"The difference here I think is that, if we really think that they are playing by American rules and they're telling us everything, then maybe that's why we keep seeing such a great number, a growth number from the Chinese economy.\"",

Here's how to protect yourself.\n\nThe latest tally for the largest-ever health industry data breach just got a lot bigger.\n\nUnitedHealth Group now said hackers stole records of about 190 million people in last February's attack on its Change Healthcare subsidiary. The health care giant's updated figure, disclosed last week, is nearly twice as large as the company's previous estimate of 100 million victims.\n\nThe attack on UnitedHealth-owned Change Healthcare disrupted the health care industry because doctors and hospitals were unable to collect payments for weeks when computer systems went down. But the headache extends to more than 1 in 2 Americans who now must wonder how their compromised records will be used.\n\nThese large-scale attacks in which individuals' identification, bank records and health data are exposed remind consumers of the need to stay \"hypervigilant,\" said John Dwyer, director of security research at Stow, Ohio-based Binary Defense, a cybersecurity company.\n\nThe treasure trove of information is valuable to scammers who want to open a fraudulent credit card or account in your name.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality of living in the world today is there are sort of certain precautions you need to take to manage your digital risk,\" Dwyer said.\n\nWhat should you do if your health data is compromised in a hack?\n\nCompanies targeted in hacks typically offer their affected customers free credit monitoring for a period. These services can alert you when bad actors open a fraudulent account with your information.\n\nBeyond signing up for credit monitoring, consumers should take other steps to protect themselves from identity theft, said Chris Pierson, CEO of BlackCloak, an Orlando, Florida-based cybersecurity company that specializes in personal digital protection for high-profile clients.\n\nYou should contact the three major credit bureaus \u2212 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2212and request a freeze on your credit. Such a move would block data thieves from using a name, stolen Social Security number, date of birth, or address, to open a new credit card or account.\n\nAlso be aware of phishing attacks via text message, email, or voice call. Sophisticated attackers might use an individual's sensitive records \u2212 date of a hospital or doctor visit for example \u2212 in an attempt to extract payment for a phony medical bill, Pierson said.\n\nYou also should monitor your bank accounts, health savings accounts, or other financial records to guard against unauthorized charges, Pierson said.\n\n\"Make yourself more resilient to a type of scam attack by understanding what tactics these people might take,\" said Pierson.\n\nWhat happened in the UnitedHealth attack?\n\nLast February, hackers accessed the computer network of UnitedHealth-owned Change Healthcare in a ransom attack. Change Healthcare is the nation's largest clearinghouse for medical payments.\n\nUnitedHealth said the vast majority of those affected by the data breach have been notified. The final number of people affected by the hack will be confirmed at a later date in a required filing with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, the company said in a statement.\n\nHHS investigates whether breaches involve violations of health information privacy and security laws and publicly reports attacks that affect 500 or more on its website.\n\n\"Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals\u2019 information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nConsumers can access information about credit monitoring and the circumstances of the attack at this site, changecybersupport.com.\n\nUnitedHealth said the hackers' haul included customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or birthdates. Other pilfered records may have included health insurance information, billing claims, or health records such as diagnostic codes, medicines, test results, images and treatment information.\n\nAfter filing a lawsuit against Change Healthcare last December, Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers said the data hack \"compromised the most sensitive privacy and financial data of Nebraskans\" and shut down health insurance payments to medical providers. Nebraska is the first state to sue the company over the data hack. More than four dozen lawsuits have been filed in connection with the data breach.\n\nWhile stolen records varied by individual, the data breach included some Social Security numbers. In rare instances, bank information, payment cards, driver's licenses, or other identification cards might have been accessed, the company said.\n\nHealth care companies are a vulnerable target\n\nHospitals, health care systems and health insurers have faced a growing number of attacks in recent years from cybercriminals who demand ransom payments. In such attacks, hackers take control of a hospital or health company's data systems and demand a ransom payment for the return of control.\n\nCybercriminals covet health data because it tends to be more accurate than other sources of information, Pierson said.\n\n\"The quality of information in the health care and financial sectors is more pristine, Pierson said.\n\nBecause the data is so valuable, health care companies often face a grave risk of cyberattack, said Frank Balonis, chief information security officer at Kiteworks, a San Mateo, California-based firm that provides secure data-sharing solutions.\n\nKiteworks ranked risk scores for the top 11 hacks across all industries last year based on factors such as the size of the attack, economic loss, type of data stolen and regulatory compliance. Other high-profile data hacks on Ticketmaster and the pathology laboratory Synnovis impacted more people, but those attacks had a lower risk than the Change Healthcare breach, according to Kiteworks' analysis.\n\nOnly the National Public Data breach \u2212 a data aggregator for background checks \u2212 had a risk score on par with the Change Healthcare breach, according to Kiteworks. The National Public Data breach exposed nearly 3 billion records of consumers including names, email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses and Social Security numbers.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth\u2019s Change Healthcare unit suffered a data breach in February 2024, the news of which surfaced Feb. 21.\n\nInitially reported to have affected around 100 million individuals , the U.S. health insurance giant has now revealed that the actual number is significantly higher: 190 million. This makes it the largest breach of medical data in U.S. history, affecting nearly half the country\u2019s population.\n\nA breach of this magnitude can have devastating consequences for the American people as malicious actors could exploit the data for a range of attacks if it finds its way to the dark web.\n\nI\u2019M GIVING AWAY THE LATEST & GREATEST AIRPODS PRO 2\n\nThe updated impact assessment\n\nUnitedHealth confirmed on Friday, Jan. 24, 2025, that the ransomware attack on its Change Healthcare unit affected approximately 190 million people in the United States. The company had previously estimated the number of affected individuals to be around 100 million in its preliminary analysis filed with the Office for Civil Rights, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that investigates data breaches.\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n\nUnitedHealth stated that the majority of those impacted have already been notified, either directly or through substitute notice. The final tally of affected individuals will be confirmed and submitted to the Office for Civil Rights at a later date.\n\nThe company tells CyberGuy it is \"not aware of any misuse of individuals\u2019 information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis.\" However, UnitedHealth did not disclose when it became aware of the additional 90 million victims, how the revised figure was determined or what changes led to the updated number.\n\nTHE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nWhat you need to know about the data breach\n\nThe cyberattack on Change Healthcare in February caused widespread disruptions across the U.S. healthcare sector, as the company took its systems offline to contain the breach. This shutdown impacted critical services such as claims processing, payments and data sharing, which many healthcare providers rely on.\n\nThe stolen data varied by individual but included a broad range of personal and sensitive information, such as names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses and government ID numbers, including Social Security, driver\u2019s license and passport details.\n\nPlus, hackers may have accessed health-related information, including diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging records, care and treatment plans, and health insurance details. Financial and banking information tied to claims and payment data was also reportedly compromised.\n\nThe breach was the result of a ransomware attack carried out by ALPHV/BlackCat, a Russian-speaking ransomware and extortion group. The attack, a form of malware intrusion, locks victims out of their data unless a ransom is paid. ALPHV/BlackCat later took credit for the attack.\n\nDuring a House hearing in April, Change Healthcare admitted that the breach was made possible due to inadequate security measures, specifically the absence of two-factor authentication to protect its systems.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFROM TIKTOK TO TROUBLE: HOW YOUR ONLINE DATA CAN BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST YOU\n\n6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach\n\n1.

See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft .\n\nMASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC\n\nKurt's key takeaway\n\nIt\u2019s surprising that a company of UnitedHealth\u2019s scale failed to implement even basic cybersecurity measures when handling customer data. A breach affecting 190 million people \u2013 nearly half of the U.S. population \u2013 is staggering, leaving almost anyone at risk of becoming a target for hackers.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD NEXT: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.",

            "content": "Photo: Pichsakul Promrungsee EyeEm/Getty Images\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has withdrawn its appeal of a district court ruling that determined the agency must recalculate Medicare Advantage Star Ratings for UnitedHealthcare.\n\nCMS had originally signaled its intent to file an appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court in Texas, but CMS has withdrawn its notice of appeal without providing an explanation for the change.\n\nThe agency had been appealing the November 22, 2024 order mandating CMS recalculate the MA 2025 star ratings without consideration of a secret shopper call used to determine UnitedHealth's score.\n\nWHAT'S THE IMPACT?\n\nUnitedHealth won its case over lowered star ratings in October 2024 when the court ruled as unlawful CMS's decision to include the disputed call in the 2024 Call Center Monitoring Performance Metrics for Accuracy and Accessibility Study.\n\nUnitedHealthcare claimed that its ratings were lowered on the basis of that one phone call. A 4-star rating, rather than a 5-star rating, on this single metric, would cause them substantial losses, both financially and in the number of members signing up for plans, according to UnitedHealthcare.\n\nThe court granted in part UnitedHealth's motion for summary judgment and denied in part its cross motion for summary judgment.\n\nA lower star rating could lead to fewer enrollments and potentially reduce the insurer's bonuses and payments from CMS.\n\nOther insurers have also sued CMS over lower star rating scores. In November, Elevance sued after winning a lawsuit in June 2024 over star ratings calculations. Centene, which also sued over the call measure, said CMS held a single call against the company \u2013 one that never reached its call center. Humana also filed a lawsuit over the calculation of cut points that determine the number of stars.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nWith Medicare Advantage plans playing a central role in UnitedHealthcare's portfolio, any change to star ratings could affect its profitability. Lower ratings may result in fewer enrollments, reduced bonuses and even customer attrition as beneficiaries look for higher-rated plans.\n\nLast December, UnitedHealthcare set its 2024 MA enrollment predictions for less than 8.1 million this year, below market forecasts. But in its Investor Conference report, UnitedHealth said it expected its Medicare Advantage business to grow.\n\nMedicare Advantage is serving an increasingly diverse, lower-income and clinically complex population, the company said. Seniors with chronic conditions are more likely to choose Medicare Advantage, and more than half of Medicare Advantage members have an annual income of less than $25,000. Medicare Advantage enrollment among minority populations has more than doubled since 2013, and now makes up more than 30% of Medicare Advantage membership.\n\nJeff Lagasse is editor of Healthcare Finance News.\n\nEmail: jlagasse@himss.org\n\nHealthcare Finance News is a HIMSS Media publication.",

            "content": "Local police conducted security checks and stood guard at the homes of health-care executives dozens of times in the weeks after UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO was killed on Dec. 4 \u2014 a sign of the heightened concerns that security professionals say persist after the targeted shooting. In suburban Texas, police arrived at the home of David Joyner, chief executive of CVS, for a \u201cspecial watch\u201d in the shooting\u2019s immediate aftermath. Later that day, police in Connecticut patrolled the secluded home of Cigna CEO David Cordani. And over the next few days, police officers in Missouri were hired to sit overnight in an unmarked car outside the home of Centene CEO Sarah London.\n\nLaw enforcement records reviewed by The Washington Post illuminate how much security considerations changed last month after Brian Thompson\u2019s killing, showing an abrupt increase in police presence and armed guards at the homes of health executives. While experts say it is not clear how long regular police patrols of executive homes will continue, security professionals say enhanced security measures are more than a passing phenomenon. Photos and bios of executives have been removed from websites, and more public meetings are expected to go virtual.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe bell has gone off and they have awoken to the fact that it\u2019s a different world,\u201d said Dale Buckner, CEO of Global Guardian, which has booked the highest revenue for this time of year in its 13-year history, with particular demand from finance, manufacturing, consulting and health care. Though he expects the surge to moderate, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it goes away.\u201d\n\nThompson, a 50-year-old father of two, was shot to death on a sidewalk outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealth Group was holding an investor conference. He had risen from roots in small-town Iowa to run UnitedHealth\u2019s insurance unit, the biggest health insurer in the nation.\n\nA New York grand jury indicted Luigi Mangione on a charge of first-degree murder \u201cin furtherance of an act of terrorism,\u201d among other counts. He has pleaded not guilty to the state charges and is being held without bail. He faces federal charges, one of which could bring the death penalty; he has not yet entered a plea on those charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnitedHealth did not publicized the venue for the conference, but it appears to have held the annual event at the same hotel \u2014 the New York Hilton Midtown \u2014 for the past three years, based on photos and video footage of the event space.\n\nA UnitedHealth spokesperson said the company had no comment.\n\nThe deadly attack, on a sidewalk in the heart of the nation\u2019s financial capital, shocked people in the health-care industry, as did the outpouring of public anger that followed. Many posted comments on social media mocking Thompson\u2019s death and lauding Mangione for striking a blow against a system they loathe.\n\n\u201cI do worry about copycats, the people that want to make a statement,\u201d said Manny Mounouchos, CEO of the security firm Avante. The Toronto-based firm has seen a \u201chuge increase in protecting CEOs,\u201d he said, adding that other events such as kidnappings have contributed to security worries. Some companies are even reconsidering holding annual shareholder meetings in person, he said. \u201cIt definitely is a big risk to have an in-person\u201d meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of the biggest companies in health care and pharmaceuticals are expected to hold their annual shareholder meetings virtually, though more than two dozen held them in person last year, a Post review of securities filings shows.\n\nAs a result of the UnitedHealthcare attack, \u201cthere will be some heightened security around where we have our annual meeting,\u201d said Michael Witzeman, head of investor relations for Chemed, which operates a business providing end-of-life care. Quest Diagnostics, which also plans to hold its annual meeting this year in person, will have \u201crobust security measures in place,\u201d said Jillian Flanagan, a spokesperson.\n\nBecton, Dickinson and Co., a medical technology firm, said on Dec. 19 that its shareholder meeting would be virtual this year, after holding it in person in 2024. A spokesperson said the company considered a \u201cvariety of factors\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t publicly discuss security practices.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany companies began holding shareholder meetings online during the covid-19 pandemic and have stuck with the format, which makes it easier for more people to attend, according to technology firms that host virtual meetings. Security is also \u201cdefinitely a factor,\u201d according to Bill Kennedy, a vice president at Broadridge, one of the leading virtual platforms.\n\nCVS, Cigna and Humana have removed photos of executives from their websites. UnitedHealth and Centene, which manages health benefits for government-sponsored plans, took down their webpages for executive leaders.\n\nPublicly traded companies have to report financial benefits they pay to their top executives above $10,000, perks that often include payments for personal security. Moderna, maker of one of the most widely used coronavirus vaccines, disclosed that it gave its CEO $1 million for security in 2023 \u201cin response to a heightened threat environment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCVS said last year that it paid its then-CEO about $44,000 in 2023 for \u201cpersonal protection,\u201d in addition to about $350,000 for personal use of corporate aircraft and a company car and driver \u2014 as required by its security program. Cigna disclosed paying its CEO about $180,000 for using company aircraft and less than $10,000 for \u201csecurity system monitoring and maintenance.\u201d Centene also paid its CEO for use of a company plane but didn\u2019t report paying for personal security. UnitedHealth said its CEO, Andrew Witty, is \u201cencouraged\u201d to use corporate aircraft for personal travel but didn\u2019t in 2023.\n\nTo survey how Thompson\u2019s killing has affected executive security, The Post requested records of calls to law enforcement from the homes of more than 20 health-care and pharmaceutical executives during 2024. The records consist of notes by police dispatchers that describe the nature of each contact, though some are heavily redacted. Officials in Denver declined to release records of police responses to the home of one CEO, saying the \u201cprivacy considerations for the residents at this address and potential security considerations outweigh the public interest.\u201d\n\nThe records show that concern for executive safety isn\u2019t limited to health-care insurers. In a leafy New Jersey suburb, police began regularly checking the home of Robert Davis, CEO of pharmaceutical giant Merck on Dec. 8, according to emergency dispatch records. Officers continued patrolling the house \u2014 once conducting four checks in a day, reporting that all was in order \u2014 even as armed private security guards were providing 24-hour protection, the records show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New Jersey records don\u2019t disclose a reason for the patrols or security. But they marked an abrupt surge in activity from earlier in the year, when officers conducted just a few checks and responded when an apparently dazed woman wandered into Davis\u2019s backyard. In the span of about two weeks in December, emergency dispatchers logged 28 calls associated with Davis\u2019s home, more than four times as many as for the rest of the year.\n\nMerck disclosed last year that it paid Davis about $12,000 for \u201cinstallation, maintenance and remote access of home security,\u201d in addition to personal use of company aircraft and a car and driver.\n\nMerck declined to comment.\n\nAt the homes of Cigna\u2019s CEO and chief financial officer, local police in Connecticut hadn\u2019t received any calls for service in 2024 until Dec. 4, records show, when they checked on each of their homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal police were hired to provide security at the home of Cordani, Cigna\u2019s CEO, according to records and interviews. At one point, police responded to a \u201csuspicious vehicle\u201d there.\n\nThe local police chief said an officer working on \u201cprivate duty\u201d at the CEO\u2019s house saw something that looked suspicious but turned out to be a \u201cguy looking for his dog.\u201d The chief added, \u201cThere\u2019s no cases up there that rose to anything of significance.\u201d\n\nCigna didn\u2019t offer a comment in response to repeated requests.\n\nOn the morning Thompson was killed, police in Texas showed up at the house of David Joyner, who was promoted to chief executive of CVS last fall. Police released a heavily redacted report of the \u201cspecial watch,\u201d which a lawyer for the locality described as dealing with the \u201cdetection, investigation, or prosecution of crime which resulted in an outcome other than conviction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week later, police in Minnesota patrolled the home of Steve Nelson, who was tapped in November to lead the CVS health insurance unit, Aetna. Records show that officers were \u201cdoing house checks\u201d for an \u201cexecutive that lives here.\u201d\n\nCVS declined to answer written questions about its executives\u2019 security.\n\nTwo days after Thompson\u2019s killing, police in Missouri patrolled the house of Sarah London, CEO of Centene. In the days that followed, emergency dispatchers logged at least 15 more calls associated with the home she shares with her husband, including two consecutive days when someone accidentally set off the alarm.\n\nSome of those patrols were a \u201cservice we offer for residents of any ilk in town if something is going on around their home,\u201d the local police chief said. He added, \u201cWe did it for a few of the CEOs that live in town.\u201d\n\nCentene didn\u2019t answer emailed questions. \u201cWe are committed to the safety of all of our employees, who work tirelessly to effectively serve our members and improve the health of the communities we serve,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nFor at least several nights, off-duty police officers were hired to sit outside London\u2019s home, the records show. Just after 10 one night in December, an off-duty officer requested backup after reporting that a person had shown up \u201cclaiming he lives at the address but has no ID.\u201d",

In 2023, Oklahoma ranked 47th.\n\nThe annual study is completed by the United Health Foundation, a private nonprofit established by the UnitedHealth group with a goal of improving health and health care. Rankings are based on nearly 90 measures of health and well-being.\n\nKeith Reed, Oklahoma commissioner of health, said in a House committee hearing Tuesday that despite the outcomes of the study, he sees a bright spot in the state\u2019s rank of 39th for health outcomes. He said it\u2019s an improvement on last year\u2019s ranking of 41st. This ranking includes behavioral health, mortality and physical health.\n\nThe study found that Oklahomans had improved access to high-speed internet and less occupational fatalities, but more suicides and an increased burden of housing costs.\n\nThe state ranked 45th in social and economic factors, including measures like education, economic resources and community and family safety.\n\nFor measures of physical environment like air and water quality, climate and health, housing and transit, Oklahoma was 49th in the country with only California ranked lower.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s clinical care was ranked at 46th. This factors in access to care, quality of care and preventive clinical services.\n\nFinally, Oklahoma\u2019s behavioral health such as nutrition, physical activity, sexual health, sleep, and smoking/tobacco use ranked at 47.\n\nThe study found that as a whole, the U.S. experienced decreases in unemployment, smoking and uninsured individuals in 2024, but drug deaths, e-cigarettes and low birth weights increased.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s neighbor, Colorado, ranked 10th best.

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group, one of the biggest players in U.S. healthcare, recently disclosed a significant cyberattack that compromised the personal data of nearly half the American population. The breach has left many questioning the security of sensitive health information in an increasingly digitized industry. To add to the complexity, the company has undergone a significant leadership transition, appointing Tim Noel as its new CEO during one of the most turbulent periods in UnitedHealth\u2019s history. With millions of Americans watching, this moment could define the company\u2019s legacy.\n\nHow The UnitedHealth Cyberattack Exposed Sensitive Data Of Millions\n\nThe cyberattack, as reported by The Detroit News, compromised sensitive information, including personal health records and financial data, affecting nearly 50% of the U.S. population. Cybersecurity experts have long flagged healthcare as a prime target for attacks due to the value of its data and the sector\u2019s lagging security measures. UnitedHealth now finds itself under intense scrutiny, not only for the breach itself but for the systemic vulnerabilities that allowed it to happen.\n\nThis breach serves as a wake-up call for the entire healthcare industry, highlighting the urgent need to prioritize cybersecurity. Health data isn\u2019t just numbers and files\u2014it\u2019s deeply personal, tied to families, finances, and individuals\u2019 well-being. For UnitedHealth, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher as it works to repair the trust of its members and prevent future attacks.\n\nHow UnitedHealth Plans To Respond To The Cyberattack\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s response to the massive cyberattack has been swift. Still, the attack highlights the growing challenges healthcare organizations face when protecting sensitive data. According to HIPAA Journal, responding effectively to a breach of this scale requires a multi-pronged approach. UnitedHealth has launched a comprehensive internal investigation to uncover the root causes of the breach while notifying affected individuals and offering services such as identity theft monitoring and fraud protection. These immediate actions signal the company\u2019s commitment to mitigating harm and rebuilding trust among its members. However, as experts note, addressing the short-term impact is just the beginning\u2014systemic changes are necessary to prevent future incidents and restore confidence in the company\u2019s ability to safeguard personal health information.\n\nBeyond these initial measures, UnitedHealth has emphasized the importance of improving its cybersecurity infrastructure to close existing gaps and defend against evolving threats. Drawing from the strategies outlined in the HIPAA Journal analysis of similar incidents, this could involve deploying advanced threat detection systems, conducting regular audits, and enhancing employee training to reduce vulnerabilities. While these steps are promising, they underscore the critical need for the company to move beyond reactive measures and establish a proactive culture of security.\n\nTim Noel Steps Into Leadership During Crisis\n\nAs UnitedHealth grapples with the fallout from the cyberattack, the company has turned to new leadership for guidance. Tim Noel, who joined the company in 2007 and previously led the UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement division, has been appointed CEO, taking the reins during a time of heightened challenges. This leadership change is a bold move, placing Noel at the forefront of efforts to navigate the company out of its current crisis.\n\nAccording to NPR, Noel is known for his focus on innovation and operational efficiency, qualities that will be critical in addressing the breach\u2019s immediate and long-term impacts. His leadership represents a fresh perspective, one that UnitedHealth hopes will steer the company toward greater accountability and resilience.\n\nTim Noel\u2019s Leadership Could Shape The Future Of UnitedHealth\n\nTim Noel\u2019s appointment as CEO comes at a critical juncture for UnitedHealth. His leadership will be tested as the company navigates the immediate challenges of the breach and works to implement lasting changes. For millions of Americans, UnitedHealth\u2019s response to this crisis isn\u2019t just a corporate matter\u2014it\u2019s personal. The data breach has exposed vulnerabilities that have real consequences for individuals and families, and it\u2019s clear that the company\u2019s actions must go beyond PR campaigns and superficial fixes.\n\nAs the healthcare industry continues to grapple with evolving digital threats, Noel\u2019s approach to leadership could set a precedent for how companies respond to crises of this magnitude. Whether UnitedHealth emerges as a leader in cybersecurity or becomes a cautionary tale will depend on how effectively it balances innovation, accountability, and customer trust.",

Either way, the data breach \u2013 which was confirmed to be ransomware \u2013 is the largest known breach at a HIPAA-regulated entity.\n\nThe previous record was set by Anthem in 2015 and affected 78.8 million individuals, according to the HIPAA Journal.\n\nThe breach had widespread effects. An April 2024 survey from the American Medical Association found more than three-quarters of physician practices experienced severe disruptions due to the cyberattack: 36% experienced suspension in claim payments, 32% were unable to submit claims, and 39% were unable to obtain electronic remittance advice.\n\nBecause of the claims issues, 80% of practices lost revenue from unpaid claims and 85% committed additional staff and time to complete revenue cycle tasks.\n\nIn May, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty confirmed to Congress that he made the decision to pay $22 million in bitcoin ransom to protect the health information of patients.\n\nUHG CFO John Rex said last April that the cyberattack was projected to cost between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in 2024.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nUnitedHealth Group's Optum bought Change for $13 billion two years ago.\n\nIn December the Nebraska Attorney General filed a lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group and its Change and Optum subsidiaries, claiming the companies violated state laws on consumer protection following the cyberattack.\n\nIn the complaint, Nebraska AG Mike Hilgers said the data breach and subsequent operational shutdown exposed the PHI of what his office believes to be \"at least hundreds of thousands of Nebraskans, if not over a million.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a number of systemic failures, including outdated and poorly segmented IT systems that failed to meet enterprise security standards; an inadequate response to the breach, including the failure to detect unauthorized access for over a week, allowing hackers to establish themselves unnoticed inside Change's systems and access PHI; and delays in notifying consumers of the breach, with affected Nebraskans only beginning to receive notifications nearly five months after the breach was discovered.\n\nJeff Lagasse is editor of Healthcare Finance News.\n\nEmail: jlagasse@himss.org\n\nHealthcare Finance News is a HIMSS Media publication.",

Around 190 million individuals are thought to have been affected.\n\nThe new estimate is almost double the previous figure of 100 million, according to a statement from UnitedHealth Group.\n\n\u201cChange Healthcare estimates that the total number of individuals impacted by the cyberattack is approximately 190 million,\u201d confirmed Tyler Mason, a spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe majority of those affected have already been notified individually or through substitute notices. The final number will be verified and reported to the Office for Civil Rights in due course.\u201d\n\nThe ransomware attack on Change Healthcare in early 2024 is thought to have been carried out by an affiliate of the ALPHV ransomware group, also known as BlackCat. This notorious organisation operates on a ransomware-as-a-service model, where affiliates deploy malicious software and share the profits with the operators.\n\nIn this instance, the affiliate reportedly extorted $22 million from Change Healthcare. However, instead of dividing the ransom as promised, ALPHV\u2019s core operators allegedly kept the entire sum before vanishing. The affiliate, left with gigabytes of sensitive data, later rebranded itself as RansomHub and emerged as a new and serious threat.\n\nThe rebranded group is said to have demanded additional payments, although it remains unclear if these were made.\n\nDespite the significant breach, Mason stated that there is no evidence to date of the stolen information being used maliciously. \u201cWe are not aware of any misuse of individuals\u2019 information as a result of this incident,\u201d he said, adding that no electronic medical records have surfaced during the analysis of the compromised data.\n\nBreaches of this nature often lead to phishing scams, business email compromises, and other forms of cybercrime.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe massive cyberattack on Change Healthcare last year may have compromised the data of about 190 million people \u2014 more than half the U.S. population, according to an update from its parent company UnitedHealth on Friday.\n\nThe new estimate of affected individuals far surpasses Change\u2019s previous tally. In October, the technology firm and claims processor said the ransomware attack had exposed information from 100 million Americans, making it the largest healthcare data breach ever reported to federal regulators.\n\nChange isn\u2019t aware of any misuse of exposed data as a result of the breach, and hasn\u2019t seen electronic medical record databases appear in its analysis of compromised information, a UnitedHealth spokesperson said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe vast majority of the 190 million affected individuals have already been notified, either through individual letters or through the substitute notice published on the company\u2019s website. Data exposed could include contact information, health insurance details, health information and billing and claims data, according to the notice.\n\nThe update comes weeks after UnitedHealth reported a significant financial hit from the Change cyberattack during an earnings call. The healthcare giant spent $3.1 billion responding to the attack in 2024, outstripping previous spending estimates.\n\nThe ransomware attack that hit Change in February last year set off weeks of disruptions for the healthcare sector. A group called AlphV, also known as Blackcat, claimed responsibility for the incident. UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty later confirmed the company paid a $22 million ransom in Bitcoin in an attempt to protect personal information after the attack.\n\nProviders reported a range of financial and operational challenges during the outage, which hamstrung their ability to receive reimbursement for services, check patients\u2019 insurance coverage and file prior authorization requests. Some practices worried they would fold if payments were held up for too long, leading both UnitedHealth and the CMS to set up financial assistance programs for providers after the attack.\n\nLawmakers also raised concerns about the attack\u2019s impact on the sector \u2014 and the potentially huge breach of Americans\u2019 health data. In May, Witty told lawmakers the attack may have compromised the data of one third of people in the U.S.\n\nChange\u2019s review of compromised data is now substantially complete, according to a UnitedHealth spokesperson. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the HHS\u2019 Office for Civil Rights at a later date.",

In October, this was largely confirmed when Change Healthcare reported a number of 100,000,000 affected individuals.\n\nBesides the enormous number of victims, the story behind this ransomware attack is also very complex, because of the cybercriminals involved and how the first group that received the ransom payment disappeared without paying their affiliates.\n\nThe ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group claimed the initial attack. The UnitedHealth Group reportedly paid $22 million to receive a decryptor and to prevent the attackers from publicly releasing the stolen data.\n\nBut shortly after the payment, ALPHV disappeared in an unconvincing exit scam designed to make it look as if the group\u2019s website had been seized by the FBI, forgetting to pay its affiliates in the process. A month later, newcomer ransomware group RansomHub listed Change Healthcare as a victim on its own website, claiming to have the data that ALPHV stole.\n\nAccording to BleepingComputer, the original attackers joined forces with RansomHub and never deleted the data. A few days later, the listing on the RansomHub leaks site disappeared, which usually means someone paid the ransom.\n\nStolen information\n\nThe data breach at Change Healthcare is the largest healthcare data breach in US history. Although Change Healthcare provided details about the types of medical and patient data that was stolen, it can\u2019t provide exact details for every individual. However, the exposed information may include:\n\nContact information: Names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and email addresses.\n\nHealth insurance information: Details about primary, secondary, or other health plans/policies, insurance companies, member/group ID numbers, and Medicaid-Medicare-government payor ID numbers.\n\nHealth information: Medical record numbers, providers, diagnoses, medicines, test results, images, and details of care and treatment.\n\nBilling, claims, and payment information: Claim numbers, account numbers, billing codes, payment card details, financial and banking information, payments made, and balances due.\n\nOther personal information: Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license or state ID numbers, and passport numbers.\n\nChange Healthcare added:\n\n\u201cThe information that may have been involved will not be the same for every impacted individual. To date, we have not yet seen full medical histories appear in the data review.\u201d\n\nProtecting yourself after a data breach\n\nThere are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the victim of a data breach.\n\nCheck the vendor\u2019s advice.

The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money \u2014 maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is UnitedHealth Group Inc (Symbol: UNH), which saw buying by Director Timothy Patrick Flynn.\n\nBack on January 17, Flynn invested $511,575.00 into 1,000 shares of UNH, for a cost per share of $511.57. In trading on Monday, shares were changing hands as low as $539.98 per share, which is 5.6% above Flynn's purchase price. UnitedHealth Group Inc shares are currently trading +2.10% on the day.

The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at UnitedHealth Group Inc, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.\n\nThe report stated, ''Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation.

However, as first reported by TechCrunch, UnitedHealth confirmed on Friday that the figure has nearly doubled to 190 million.\n\n\"Change Healthcare has determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million,\" UnitedHealth Group told TechCrunch.\n\n\"The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights at a later date.\"\n\nWhile UnitedHealth says that there are no indications that the threat actors have misused the stolen data, the sheer quantity of sensitive information stolen in the attack is massive.\n\nThis stolen data includes patients' health insurance information, medical records, billing and payment information, and sensitive personal information, such as phone numbers, addresses, and, in some cases, Social Security Numbers and government ID numbers.\n\nThe ransomware attack on UnitedHealth's subsidiary, Change Healthcare, is the largest healthcare data breach in US history.\n\nThe Change Healthcare ransomware attack\n\nIn February 2024, UnitedHealth subsidiary Change Healthcare suffered a massive ransomware attack, leading to widespread disruption to the United States healthcare system.\n\nThis disruption prevented doctors and pharmacies from filing claims and pharmacies from accepting discount prescription cards, causing patients to pay full price for medications.\n\nIt was later learned that the BlackCat ransomware gang, aka ALPHV, was behind the attack. The threat actors used stolen credentials to breach the company's Citrix remote access service, which did not have multi-factor authentication enabled.\n\nAfter breaching the network, the threat actors stole 6 TB of data and encrypted computers, causing the company to shut down IT systems and its online platforms for billing, claims, and prescription fulfillment.\n\nThe UnitedHealth Group later confirmed it paid a ransom to receive a decryptor and to prevent the threat actors from publicly releasing the stolen data. This ransom payment was allegedly $22 million, according to the BlackCat ransomware affiliate who conducted the attack.\n\nThis ransom payment was supposed to be split between the affiliate and the ransomware operators, but the BlackCat suddenly shut down in an exit scam, stealing the entire payment for themselves.\n\nALPHV affiliate claiming they were scammed by BlackCat\n\nsource: Dmitry Smilyanets\n\nThis is where it got worse for UnitedHealth, as the threat actor behind the attack stated that they did not delete the stolen data as promised.\n\nThe attacker then partnered with a new ransomware operation named RansomHub and began leaking some of the stolen data, demanding an additional payment for the data not to be released.\n\nA few days later, the Change Healthcare entry on RansomHub's data leak site mysteriously disappeared, indicating that United Health likely paid a second ransom demand.\n\nUnitedHealth said in April that the Change Healthcare ransomware attack caused $872 million in losses, which increased as part of the Q3 2024 earnings to an expected $2.45 billion for the nine months to September 30, 2024,",

Change Healthcare paid at least two ransoms to keep other info from being made public. According to the TechCrunch report, UnitedHealth had previously said around 100 million people were impacted by the breach.\n\nAs PYMNTS wrote last month, the attack was one of several high profile cybersecurity incidents last year, a list that also includes a breach at background check firm National Public Data that led to the stolen information of 2.9 billion people. There was also the Snowflake data breach which encompassed AT&T, Santander Bank, Advance Auto Parts, Ticketmaster parent company LiveNation and more than 160 of the world\u2019s largest companies.\n\n\u201cBut those attacks only scratched the surface of emerging enterprise vulnerabilities,\u201d that report said. \u201cAs we enter 2025, the lessons from these breaches are more relevant than ever for businesses navigating the digital frontier.\u201d\n\nIn other cybersecurity news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in security systems.\n\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that the number of chief operating officers (COOs) reporting that their companies have adopted AI-powered automated cybersecurity management systems tripled last year, reaching 55% in August 2024, up from about 17% last May.\n\nEach of the COOs surveyed for the research represents a company that generates more than $1 billion in revenue per year.",

For a time, the outage also snarled pharmacy counters, with some patients saying they struggled to fill prescriptions.\n\nEarlier this year, the federal government opened an investigation to determine if a breach of protected health information occurred and whether UnitedHealth Group and Change Healthcare were in compliance with federal privacy, security and breach notification rules.\n\nIn July, the company started sending letters to patients about the hack, saying information ranging from health conditions to Social Security numbers may have been accessed.\n\nUnitedHealth Group says it has repaired the affected systems at Change Healthcare.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission offers a range of advice for people affected by a data breach at IdentityTheft.gov/databreach.

This staggering figure is nearly double the previous estimate of 100 million people affected. The stolen data trove contains a wide range of personal and medical information.\n\nThe healthcare giant revealed the latest numbers in an email to TechCrunch on Friday evening.\n\n\"Change Healthcare has determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million,\" said Tyler Mason, a spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group. He added that the vast majority have already received individual notification or substitute notice about the breach.\n\nDespite the sheer scale of the compromised personal data, UnitedHealth maintains there is no evidence of any misuse of individuals' information resulting from the incident so far. The company also claims it has not discovered any of the stolen electronic medical record databases appearing online during its analysis.\n\nThe massive data breach, which occurred in February 2024, is now regarded as the largest healthcare-related cyberattack in US history. It caused widespread disruptions and outages across the nation's healthcare system for several months. The enormity eclipses the previous healthcare data breach record holder from 2015 involving Anthem Inc., which impacted around 78.8 million individuals.\n\nChange Healthcare, acquired by UnitedHealth in 2022, is one of the largest processors of medical claims and handlers of sensitive health data in the country. The stolen patient data includes names, dates of birth, contact details, government ID numbers such as Social Security numbers, medical diagnoses, test results, treatment plans, insurance information, and even financial data.\n\nInvestigators have attributed the attack to the notorious Russian cybercrime group ALPHV, also known as BlackCat. The hackers gained initial access using a stolen account credential that lacked multi-factor authentication security, according to UnitedHealth.\n\nThe ALPHV gang then deployed its powerful ransomware, encrypting Change Healthcare's data until ransoms were paid to prevent the information from being published online. However, even with the ransom being paid, some of the stolen data still ended up being leaked on the internet by the hackers.\n\nThe financial fallout has been severe. Profits for the company dropped by over a third in 2024, falling from around $22.3 billion in 2023 to approximately $14.4 billion last year. The projected total cost of recovery and remediation efforts is estimated to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion.\n\nFollowing the breach, the Office for Civil Rights within the US Department of Health and Human Services recommended that healthcare providers enhance security measures. This includes implementing multi-factor authentication, encrypting patient data, and conducting regular compliance checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThe incident further illustrates how the healthcare sector remains the primary target for bad actors.",

The healthcare company, which provides health insurance and other medical services to a substantially high number of Americans, now reports that the number of affected individuals exceeds 190 million, according to a report by Reuters. The hack mainly targeted UnitedHealth Group\u2019s tech arm, Change Healthcare, last February.\n\nThe attack hindered the firm\u2019s IT system, affecting its operations for up to a month. Under this cyberattack, personal information such as names, physical addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, and passport numbers, as well as medical and financial data of customers, was said to have been compromised.\n\nEven in June 2024, the company admitted that the hackers behind the cyberattack had likely accessed health insurance information and personal health details, including medical test results, images, and financial & banking information. In fact, the company began notifying impacted customers in July 2024, four months after the incident took place.\n\nBut the interesting thing is, in its statement, the company claims that it has \u201cnot seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis.\u201d\n\nIn October 2024, the US Health Department shared an update regarding the breach and revealed that the personal information of approximately 100 million people had been exposed due to the hack. However, according to the report, the company has now filed a final report with the US Department of Health and Human Services and confirmed the updated number, which is almost double the previous data.\n\nSpeaking of the hacking group behind the incident, the Russian \u2018AlphV,\u2019 also known as the \u2018BlackCat\u2019 ransomware group, claimed responsibility for the attack. They reportedly exploited a loophole in remote-access Citrix software to gain access to the company\u2019s systems. After that, as usual, they locked up the data to make ransom demands.\n\nAccording to the report, during the testimony in 2024 regarding the incident, CEO Andrew Witty admitted that Change Healthcare did not have multi-factor authentication in place when the attack took place.\n\nMeanwhile, the cyberattack has damaged UnitedHealth in both ways \u2013 in terms of reputation as well as financially. This is expected to cost the company between $2-$2.5 billion. Not only that, but the company has reportedly made two ransom payments to the responsible hacking group, with one Installment being around $22 million, according to reports.\n\nCyberattacks are not a rare phenomenon for US companies, as last month the US Treasury Department officially confirmed that it had suffered a significant cybersecurity breach in November 2024. In this breach, Chinese hackers accessed unclassified documents. In the same month, two of the biggest telecommunications giants \u2013 AT&T and Verizon \u2013 also suffered a cybersecurity breach from the Chinese-linked Salt Typhoon cyber espionage group.",

            "content": "The number of people impacted by last year\u2019s ransomware attack on Change Healthcare has increased to nearly 200 million.\n\nUnitedHealth, the company that owns Change Healthcare, provided an updated figure on Friday evening that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn a statement, a UnitedHealth spokesperson told Recorded Future News that the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the cyberattack is now \u201capproximately 190 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice,\u201d the company said, noting that the final number of those impacted will be confirmed and sent to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights \u201cat a later date.\u201d\n\nIn October, Change Healthcare, a healthcare technology company, updated filings with the federal government to warn that about 100 million people had information accessed.\n\nUnitedHealth did not respond to multiple questions about when the company first learned of the additional 90 million victims, how it determined the new number and what changed since the last update. HHS did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s CEO previously told Congress that about one-third of all Americans had information processed in some way by the company because it handles about 1 in 3 medical records and processes about half of all medical claims in the U.S.\n\nThe company admitted in June that the hackers behind the incident likely accessed health insurance information, extensive personal health information like test results and images, financial and banking information as well as personal data like Social Security numbers.\n\nBut after completing more than 90% of its review of the data accessed and stolen, UnitedHealth claimed it found \u201cno evidence\u201d that materials such as doctors\u2019 charts or full medical histories were exfiltrated.\n\nIn its statement on Friday, a UnitedHealth spokesperson said the company has \u201cnot seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis.\u201d\n\nThe company paid a $22 million ransom to the cybercrime gang behind the incident, but a dispute among them led to the data being posted on another group\u2019s leak site. Since the attack occurred, Change Healthcare and UnitedHealth have spent months going through the stolen documents to see who needed to be notified.\n\nHHS told Change Healthcare in May that it would have to file breach notification letters to all victims on behalf of the thousands of affected hospitals, doctor\u2019s offices, pharmacies and other facilities.\n\n\u201cThis ensures that the potentially millions of Americans, including the elderly, the disabled, those with limited English proficiency, those with limited access to technology, and more, will understand the impact of this breach on their private medical records and their health care,\u201d Melanie Fontes Rainer, director of HHS\u2019s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), said last year.\n\nWhile the company is still determining the full extent of the breach, so far it has confirmed that names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and email addresses were leaked to the hackers.\n\nUnitedHealth said the attackers also likely accessed some combination of:",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US officials dropped their appeal of a UnitedHealth Group Inc. lawsuit challenging the federal Medicare program\u2019s quality ratings, a potential boon for insurers protesting the rankings that drive billions of dollars in payments to private plans.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services withdrew its appeal in a filing in a Texas federal court Friday. The decision may signal that the Trump administration won\u2019t fight insurance companies arguing their ratings are too low, a critical issue in a pending lawsuit filed by Humana Inc. that could significantly impact its future profitability.\n\nThe move is an abrupt reversal of the agency\u2019s stance. Medicare had filed a notice of appeal on Jan. 21, the day after President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began.\n\nPending Lawsuits\n\nA federal judge in November sided with UnitedHealth, saying the US wrongly downgraded the insurance giant\u2019s quality rating. Several health insurers have sued the government over how the ratings, called stars, are calculated. None has more riding on the outcome than Humana, which focuses on private Medicare plans.\n\nIts lawsuit, pending in the Northern District of Texas, seeks to reverse a cut to its star ratings. Analysts have described the outcome of that litigation as a \u201cbinary\u201d event for the company because so much of its earnings are linked to Medicare payouts.\n\nThe ratings being contested will affect payments in 2026. Analysts from Leerink estimated in November that the lower star ratings would be a $1.8 billion headwind for the company in 2026.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Texas declined to comment on the reason for withdrawing the appeal. CMS declined to comment, citing the department-wide pause on communications.\n\nUnitedHealth had no immediate comment. The filing was first reported by Stat News.\n\n--With assistance from Ike Swetlitz and Madlin Mekelburg.\n\n(Updates with additional information starting in third paragraph)\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

            "content": "Insurance coverage denials have risen in recent years in the US, driven in part by automated algorithms powered by AI \u2013 and some recently launched artificial intelligence tools may fight back by generating automatic appeals.\n\nBut to see more lasting change, health experts say that the health insurance system needs greater reform to control high prices and ensure coverage.\n\nUnitedHealth, Humana and Cigna are facing class-action lawsuits alleging the insurers relied upon algorithms to deny lifesaving care.\n\nOne of the lawsuits alleges that Cigna denied more than 300,000 claims in a two-month period, which amounts to about 1.2 seconds for each physician-reviewed claim. Such a practice is aided by algorithms, the lawsuit said.\n\nIn 2020, UnitedHealth Group acquired naviHealth and its algorithm for predicting care, called nH Predict, which UnitedHealth uses and also contracts out to other insurers, including Humana. (A spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group denied that the algorithm is used to make coverage decisions; Humana did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe lawsuit against them alleged that nH Predict has a 90% error rate, meaning nine out of 10 denials are reversed upon appeal \u2013 but that vanishingly few patients (about 0.2%) appeal their denied claims, leading them to pay bills out of pocket or forgo necessary treatment.\n\nThat figure tracks with a survey by the non-profit KFF, which found less than 0.2% of people purchasing insurance through HealthCare.gov appeal in-network claims that are denied.\n\nWhen it comes to prior authorization, a practice in which doctors and patients must receive an insurance company\u2019s approval before starting care or medications, less than 10% of denied requests in Medicare Advantage plans (Medicare-approved plans from a private company) were appealed in 2022, according to another KFF survey.\n\nDoctor\u2019s offices now have entire departments devoted to processing and appealing prior authorization decisions.\n\nNearly half of US adults say they have unexpectedly received a medical bill or been charged a co-payment, according to a survey from the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nFour out of five said these delays caused worry and anxiety, and nearly half said their condition worsened because of delayed care. Most did not know they could appeal a denial.\n\nBut for those who do try to appeal, the process can be so labyrinthine, they are forced to give up.\n\nTwo of her three sons have severe food allergies, so Deirdre O\u2019Reilly was worried about sending one of them out of state to college. When he had a reaction, he went to the emergency room like usual.\n\nBut this time, the insurance company denied coverage for the entire visit \u2013 nearly $5,000, according to a denial letter reviewed by the Guardian. O\u2019Reilly tried to appeal four times, and each time, the insurer, BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont, gave her a different reason, she said.\n\n\u201cMy son didn\u2019t have a choice \u2013 he was going to die if he didn\u2019t go to the nearest emergency room,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\n\nShe should know; she\u2019s an intensive care physician at the University of Vermont. She has seen denials like these happen to her own patients, such as premature infants who have oxygen equipment denied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten out of control. It\u2019s changed a tremendous amount in the 20 years I\u2019ve been a physician,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that people have to go through this just to get healthcare covered \u2013 things that are basic needs.\u201d\n\nAnd many people don\u2019t have the same medical expertise and the time or resources for lengthy appeal processes.\n\n\u201cI was tenacious,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at some point, I could only fight so much.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from BlueShield Vermont said in a statement that she could not comment on an individual\u2019s health record, but denied the use of algorithms in managing care. \u201cMost\u201d prior authorization decisions were made by the insurer\u2019s team of doctors and nurses based on national guidelines, she said.\n\nVermont is one of several states that recently passed legislation to reduce the strain of prior authorizations.\n\nAutomated denials in particular have faced increased scrutiny by federal and state lawmakers.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I think there are constructive roles for improved algorithms to play.\u201d\n\nAI can help make sure forms are coded and formatted according to each insurer\u2019s specifications, she said \u2013 making sure the requests aren\u2019t kicked back for being incomplete. It could also be used by insurance companies to approve insurance requests more quickly.\n\nMost denials happen because of mistakes in filling out or filing the form, Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, said last week on an earnings call during which executives said UnitedHealthcare\u2019s revenues in 2024 neared $300bn, with the company expecting that figure to rise to $340bn in 2025.\n\nWitty estimated that 85% of denied claims could be avoided \u201cthrough technology in a more standardized approach across the industry\u201d.\n\nChanging to an industry standard, instead of each company having different forms and processes, is especially important, Witty said.\n\nBut having human oversight of automated processes is a needed change, experts said.\n\n\u201cThose algorithms aren\u2019t always getting it right, and so I think there\u2019s a fear that more of the human aspect is being pulled out of the system,\u201d said Mika Hamer, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Maryland School of Public Health.\n\nCalifornia recently enacted legislation to prohibit AI making coverage decisions and to require physician oversight.\n\nBut only addressing AI doesn\u2019t fix some of the issues underlying the decision to automate, Hamer said \u2013 including sky-high prices for medical care and medications.\n\n\u201cOne out of every $5 of the US GDP is spent on healthcare,\u201d said Hamer. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely massive system. It\u2019s going to take a massive overhaul.\u201d",

It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. It is the world\u2019s 7th largest company by revenue and the largest insurer by annual premiums. It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers. Regarding the environment, the company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 which is well ahead of the global target. The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights at a later date.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s spokesperson said the company was \u201cnot aware of any misuse of individuals\u2019 information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis.\u201d\n\nThe February 2024 cyberattack is the largest breach of medical data in U.S. history and caused months of outages across the U.S. healthcare system. Change Healthcare, a health tech giant and UnitedHealth subsidiary, is one of the largest handlers of health, medical data, and patient records; it\u2019s also one of the biggest processors of healthcare claims in the United States.\n\nThe data breach resulted in the theft of massive quantities of health and insurance-related information, some of which was published online by the hackers who claimed responsibility for the breach. Change Healthcare subsequently paid at least two ransoms to prevent further publication of the stolen files.\n\nUnitedHealth previously put the number of affected individuals at around 100 million people when the company filed its preliminary analysis with the Office for Civil Rights, the unit under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that investigates data breaches.\n\nIn its data breach notice, Change Healthcare said that the cybercriminals stole names and addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and government identity documents, which included Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, and passport numbers. The stolen health data also includes diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging, and care and treatment plans, as well as health insurance information. Change said the data also includes financial and banking information found in patient claims.\n\nThe breach was attributed to the ALPHV ransomware gang, a prolific Russian language cybercrime group. According to testimony by UnitedHealth Group\u2019s CEO Andrew Witty to lawmakers last year, the hackers broke into Change\u2019s systems using a stolen account credential, which was not protected with multi-factor authentication.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nUnitedHealth has selected company veteran Tim Noel to serve as CEO of its insurance business UnitedHealthcare, replacing former top executive Brian Thompson, who was killed last month in New York City.\n\nNoel has been with UnitedHealth for almost two decades, most recently as chief executive of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicare and retirement division.\n\nNoel steps into the role at a pivotal time for UnitedHealthcare, as the insurer grapples with public criticism and shrinking margins from offering Medicare and Medicaid coverage.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nNoel\u2019s appointment comes seven weeks after Thompson was killed outside of a hotel in Manhattan where UnitedHealth held its annual investor conference. Thompson had been with UnitedHealth since 2004 and led UnitedHealthcare since 2021.\n\nThe shocking shooting unleashed a torrent of anti-insurer sentiment online, with people celebrating Thompson\u2019s killing on social media and sharing stories of delayed or denied medical care. The public reaction raised concerns about executive safety, prompting top insurers to remove executive information from webpages and industry conferences to bolster security.\n\nIn comments following Thompson\u2019s killing, insurance executives have attempted to acknowledge the widespread discontent with the healthcare industry. During a conference call last week to discuss UnitedHealth\u2019s financial results for the fourth quarter, CEO Andrew Witty said the company will try to improve processes that cause member dissatisfaction, like claims processing and procedure approvals.\n\n\u201cWe recognize there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done,\u201d Witty said.\n\nMuch of that work will be led by Noel as the new head of UnitedHealthcare, which, with 50.7 million members, is the largest private insurer in the U.S.\n\nNoel \u201cbrings unparalleled experience to this role with a proven track record and strong commitment to improving how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners,\u201d a UnitedHealth spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nNoel has been with UnitedHealth since 2007. Before his promotion Thursday, he oversaw a segment of the business that includes UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nMA is a controversial privatized alternative to traditional Medicare coverage. Previously, MA was a source of considerable profit for insurers, but has become less lucrative over the past few years as seniors used more care and the Biden administration cracked down on overpayments.\n\nUnitedHealthcare is the largest MA insurer, with 7.8 million people in the plans.\n\nThe company has also struggled with falling profitability in its Medicaid plans. Millions of Americans were removed from the safety net program starting in 2023 during a process called unwinding, which those who remained skewing sicker and therefore more costly to insure. Payers have accused states of moving slowly to hike rates to cover the higher expense.\n\nUnitedHealth reported a record $400.3 billion in revenue last year. However, its net income of $14.4 billion was the least since 2019, amid insurance pressures and costs of recovering from a massive cyberattack on subsidiary Change Healthcare.",

Change announced last week that its review of the impacted data is \"substantially complete.\"\n\n\u201cHad Defendants employed basic, long-established, and recommended security tools, the Data Breach should have been easily thwarted,\u201d the lawsuit states. However, Change Healthcare\u2019s remote access portal \u201cdid not have multi-factor authentication.\u201d\n\nAs a result, hackers \u201chad virtually no roadblocks in gaining access to the large quantities of Personal Information,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is baseless and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously,\u201d a spokesperson for Optum said. A subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, Optum functions as the health services and innovation arm of the company.\n\nThe 365-page includes extensive summaries of the impact on each of the plaintiffs, with repeated instances of fraudulent activity, hours spent on the phone with credit agencies and a significant increase in spam emails and scam attempts.\n\nPlaintiffs come from all regions of the United States, including Hawaii and Alaska. Only one plaintiff is unnamed, a Chicago man who is HIV positive, and \u201cdeeply concerned about the release of this information against his consent and is particularly worried about the potential impact on his employment prospects and his relationships in his community,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nPlaintiffs are asking for compensatory and other damages, and for UnitedHealth to pay for a minimum of five years of credit-monitoring services for the entire class.\n\n\u201cBoth before and after the Data Breach, Defendants repeatedly put their interests above those of the impacted patients,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cHowever, Defendants owed duties to Plaintiffs and Class members to implement and maintain reasonable and adequate security measures to secure, protect, and safeguard their Personal Information against unauthorized access and disclosure.\u201d\n\nMassive data breach\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2024, an affiliate of the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware group gained access to the Change Healthcare network, and spent nine days inside the network stealing data before they used ransomware to encrypt files.\n\nChange paid a $22 million ransom in bitcoin to prevent the publication of the stolen data. The ransomware group, however, reneged on the deal with Change to destroy the stolen data files, and retained the stolen data. The personal, health, and financial information of an estimated 100 million individuals was stolen in the attack.\n\nAnother ransomware group, RansomHub, confirmed that it possessed four terabytes of stolen data from the Change data breach and posted screenshots of the data on its dark web ransomware site, the lawsuit says.\n\n\u201cThe hackers continue to attempt to extort Defendants out of additional ransom payments,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cNow that Defendants have recovered their own copies of the data allowing them to continue to monetize it, however, they appear less eager to pay any further ransom.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth had more than 152 million customers at the time of the Feb. 17-20 data breach, which means about 45% of Americans have been affected. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Change Healthcare, Optum Inc., and UnitedHealth Group, including one by the state of Nebraska.\n\nDuring a conference call earlier this month, UnitedHealth Group executives cited the ransomware attack as a costly drain on revenues. The total cost of the response is now predicted to be between $2.3 billion and $2.45 billion, The HIPPA Journal recently reported.\n\nThe 65 plaintiffs fault UnitedHealth for paying the ransom, saying it \u201cdid nothing\u201d to benefit affected victims.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 decision to pay a ransom runs counter to law enforcement\u2019s recommendations, as nothing requires the hackers to keep their word that they will destroy the data after payment\u2014and they often do not.\u201d\n\nShareholder lawsuit\n\nUnitedHealth is dealing with unhappy shareholders as well. The City of Hollywood Firefighters\u2019 Pension Fund is the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit claiming that UnitedHealth executives hid the notice of a Department of Justice investigation.\n\nOn Oct. 10, 2023, UnitedHealth received notice that the DOJ had launched a \u201cnon-public antitrust investigation into the company,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\n\u201cConcealing this material information from investors and the public, UnitedHealth chairman Stephen J. Hemsley and several other senior executives immediately took action \u2013 selling more than $100 million of their UnitedHealth stock at artificially inflated prices as the market and other investors remained unaware of the new federal antitrust investigation,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal exposed the investigation in a Feb. 27, 2024 article, the price of UnitedHealth stock declined over $27 per share, falling from $525.32 per share on Feb. 26, 2024 to $498.28 on Feb. 28, 2024, the lawsuit notes.\n\n\u00a9 Entire contents copyright 2025 by InsuranceNewsNet.com Inc.

It was not clear whether the move was part of a broader policy change by President Donald Trump's new administration.\n\nCMS declined to comment, citing a pause on public communications by health agencies ordered by the Trump administration. UnitedHealth did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit concerns UnitedHealth's Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately administered health insurance plans funded by the federal Medicare program for those age 65 and older and some Americans with disabilities.\n\nCMS assigns Medicare Advantage plans ratings of one to five stars to help consumers choose among plans. UnitedHealth said in its lawsuit that some of its Medicare Advantage plans lost half a star because of a single unsuccessful call placed by a CMS test caller seeking a foreign language interpreter.\n\nUnitedHealth said that CMS was arbitrary and capricious in docking the star ratings on the basis of a single call, and said that an error by the test caller was responsible for failing to connect with a representative.\n\nA Texas federal judge in November agreed and ordered CMS to recalculate the star rating.\n\nOther insurers, including Elevance, Centene and Humana, have also sued CMS over what they allege are unfair star ratings.\n\nCMS previously recalculated star ratings for Elevance and non-profit SCAN Health Plans' Medicare Advantage plans after losing court rulings.\n\nUnitedHealth Group shares were up about 0.6% at $532.86.\n\n(Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot)",

The company\u2019s annual deliveries contracted for the first time ever in 2024, its long-term growth story remains intact driven by its thriving Energy Generation & Storage segment, expansive Supercharger network and AI advancements. Energy deployments doubled in 2024 and the upward trajectory is set to continue, thanks to the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products. Progress in the autonomous vehicle domain, including plans to launch robotaxi services in 2025, position the company well for sustained growth. Despite potential rebate cuts under a Trump presidency, Tesla is well-positioned to thrive without subsidies, thanks to its cost efficiency and unmatched scale. Tesla\u2019s robust balance sheet, with a high liquidity buffer, supports continued innovation and expansion. As such, we are bullish on the stock.

A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. However, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. A debt-laden balance sheet induces an increase in interest expenses.

The company reported mixed fiscal Q2 2025 results, wherein earnings and revenues missed estimates. Revenues were driven by continued momentum from its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business, including from winning cloud-computing contracts from AI-focused startups. ORCL\u2019s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. ORCL\u2019s partnership with Amazon for Oracle Database@AWS and general availability of Oracle Database@Google bodes well. Oracle\u2019s Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence clientele. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy. The Zacks analyst expect fiscal 2025 net sales to grow 8.7% from fiscal 2024.

Thompson most recently resided in Maple Grove, Minnesota.\n\nFollowing a five-day manhunt, Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested in a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania after an employee called police. He was later charged with several counts of murder in New York.\n\nThe New York Police Department told CBS News that there are no indications that Mangione was a UnitedHealthcare customer.\n\nOfficials believe Mangione may have targeted the company because of its status as the largest health insurer in the United States.",

For the full year, the giant\u2019s insurance division, UnitedHealthcare, reported record revenue of $298.2 billion, the company announced last Thursday.\n\nThese staggering revenue totals actually fell below investor expectations. UnitedHealth Group shares, right after the announcement, slipped 6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, just outside that capitalist bastion, victims of our for-profit healthcare system \u2014 doctors and patients alike \u2014 were braving freezing temperatures to call out the suffering that engineered UnitedHealth\u2019s exorbitant earnings. One of those demonstrators, Jenn Coffey, has been battling complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a condition so incredibly painful that it\u2019s often called the \u201csuicide disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnitedHealthcare would rather leave me in torture than grant me the peace my infusions bring,\u201d says Coffey. \u201cI\u2019m asking for a life worth dignity. I\u2019m left begging for a life worth living.\u201d\n\nDespite Coffey\u2019s pleadings, UnitedHealth has denied her the prior authorization needed to have her critically important treatment adequately covered.\n\nAt last week\u2019s protests, several other speakers shared their deeply personal experiences with a healthcare system that far too often treats patients as disposable.\n\nDr. Toutou Moussa Diallo, a New York-based researcher and healthcare activist, detailed how insurance denials led to subpar treatment for a broken ankle that only made the initial injury more debilitating. Nephrologist Cheryl Kunis shared the story of a patient who died after UnitedHealthcare refused to cover a PET scan of a malignant neck tumor.\n\nThese experiences amount to much more than isolated one-off incidents. The outpouring of anger after last month\u2019s killing of UnitedHealthcare top exec Brian Thompson \u2014 anger not at the shooting but at the company Thompson represented \u2014 shows just how many Americans are currently suffering under our privatized healthcare system.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is a multinational, Minnetonka, Minnesota-based healthcare and insurance company. It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. It is the world\u2019s 7th largest company by revenue and the largest insurer by annual premiums. It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers. Regarding the environment, the company has committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 which is well ahead of the global target. The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

It is the result of 5 decades of mergers and acquisitions that began with the formation of Charter Med Inc in 1974. Charter Med Inc was a privately held medical services firm that was soon rebranded (1978) to United Healthcare Company. United Healthcare Company became the parent and holding company for the Physician\u2019s Health Plan of Minnesota, an early HMO.\n\nThe company has had several key phases, including the late 1980s when it entered the pharmacy services industry; the mid-1990s when it made some major acquisitions to consolidate a large portion of the US HMO market, and the \u201cmodern\u201d period in which it continues to pursue growth through acquisitions, expansion and deepening penetration. Among the more notable events are the inclusion of John Deere Healthcare and the restructuring of acquired assets into the Optum segment. Optum is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\u2019s technology-focused division and includes the staffed physical-care facilities located throughout the US.\n\nToday, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It operates in four segments providing healthcare and insurance products globally. The company\u2019s four segments are UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx.

It is ranked 11th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list and had a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion at the end of 2022. Total revenue in 2022 topped $320 billion.\n\nOn a segment basis, The UnitedHealthcare segment is the largest and comprises roughly 80% of the net business. It offers consumer-oriented health benefit plans for businesses and consumers and preventative and well-being services for people over 50. It also manages Medicaid plans, family health plans and dental plans among other services.\n\nThe OptumHealth segment is a consumer-oriented platform to access a care providers and services network. The OptumInsight segment provides technology, services and outsourcing to hospitals, physicians and organizations that provide health insurance and/or health plans. The OptumRx segment serves the pharmacy industry including the retail market, home delivery and specialty services. Optum users can connect to physicians, schedule appointments, and even fill their prescriptions.\n\nUnitedHealth Group has a long track record of dividend payments that dates back to 1990. The company also has a track record for increasing its dividend if not on a consistent annual basis. The company does not have a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is committed to sustainable operations for its consumers and the planet. To that end, the company has committed to efforts that help control healthcare costs, including telehealth and value-based arrangement with providers.

The company is also committed to health equity or the idea that healthcare opportunities (including employment) be fairly and equitably available to all.",

Scott, M.D.\n\nPresident, American Medical Association\n\n\u0093It\u0092s good news that UnitedHealth Group is finally looking for ways to simplify and accelerate their prior authorization process. But seven years after a consensus statement (PDF) in which the insurance industry agreed to key reforms to improve this onerous process\u0097and with the burden and outcomes only worsening\u0097patients, physicians and policymakers are looking for specifics and meaningful, impactful changes that will break down unnecessary roadblocks and keep medical decisions between patients and physicians.\n\n\u0093Improving the prior authorization process requires meaningful actions like significantly reducing the volume of requirements, using transparent and evidenced-based clinical criteria, ensuring that qualified physicians are the only ones making denials, and requiring that decisions are made within hours, not days or weeks. Moreover, these reforms must be made across all markets, including self-funded plans, and laws must be adhered to when they are in place. In survey after survey (PDF), physicians have said prior authorization barriers have led to life-threatening events for patients and mountains of paperwork that waste staff time and fuel a physician burnout crisis. Prior authorization programs are optional for plans, but accessing healthcare is not optional for patients. Health plans need to leave the medical decision-making up to physicians and their patients.\n\n\u0093While talking about forward progress on this issue is a positive step, it must be followed by substantive actions. A new year demands a new approach\u0097enough with promises that nibble around the edges of the problem and benefit few if any. Our patients deserve broad and meaningful prior authorization reforms, and we urge health insurers to get on board with immediate actions.\u0094\n\nThe American Medical Association is the physicians\u0092 powerful ally in patient care. As the only medical association that convenes 190+ state and specialty medical societies and other critical stakeholders, the AMA represents physicians with a unified voice to all key players in health care. The AMA leverages its strength by removing the obstacles that interfere with patient care, leading the charge to prevent chronic disease and confront public health crises and, driving the future of medicine to tackle the biggest challenges in health care.",

The motion, submitted on Thursday, responds to allegations brought by numerous provider organizations and the American Medical Association, according to FiercePharma. The case has been consolidated into multidistrict litigation that combines complaints from dozens of plaintiffs.\n\nThe providers allege that MultiPlan collaborated with major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, Elevance Health, Aetna, and Cigna, to implement out-of-network reimbursement rates based on a shared data methodology. This approach, they argue, undermines competition and effectively fixes prices. In their December filing, the plaintiffs labeled this arrangement the \u201cMultiPlan Cartel,\u201d asserting that it resulted in significant underpayments\u2014approximately $19 billion in 2020 and $6.4 billion in just the third quarter of 2024.\n\nPer FiercePharma, MultiPlan and the insurers countered these claims, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to establish the necessary elements of an antitrust case. They contended that their reimbursement system relies on publicly available data, not proprietary competitor data, and that similar lawsuits against MultiPlan have been dismissed in the past for insufficient evidence.\n\nRelated: DOJ and States File Suit to Block UnitedHealth\u2019s $3.3B Acquisition of Amedisys\n\nIn their motion, legal representatives for MultiPlan and the insurers emphasized that the plaintiffs lack antitrust standing and have not demonstrated the existence of a standalone product or specific antitrust conspiracy. They also noted that prior cases involving some of the same plaintiffs have not held up in court.\n\nThe provider plaintiffs and their legal team dismissed these arguments, stating the motion has no merit. \u201cMultiPlan conspired with major insurers to orchestrate a price-fixing cartel that has devastated healthcare access across America,\u201d the attorneys asserted in a statement. They highlighted the financial strain this alleged scheme has placed on healthcare providers, particularly those in rural areas, where nearly 30% of hospitals are at risk of closure.\n\nThe litigation, according to the plaintiffs, seeks to dismantle what they describe as a conspiracy that harms both healthcare providers and patients. They argue that restoring competition to the out-of-network payments market is essential to ensuring fair compensation for doctors and maintaining access to quality care for all Americans.\n\nSource: FiercePharma",

By addressing root causes of healthcare costs, particularly high prices for procedures, services, and prescriptions, UnitedHealth Group is advocating for collaboration across the system to ensure affordability.\n\nSandeep Dadlani, Chief Digital and Technology Officer of UnitedHealth Group, said digital engagement metrics reflect the company\u2019s shift to meet consumer preferences. The US-based UnitedHealth Group did not reveal its spending on digital transformation.\n\nUHC mobile app visits increased 66 percent year-over-year, with the app maintaining its position as the top healthcare app in major app stores. Consumer digital engagement across UnitedHealthcare rose by a third, while app registrations nearly doubled.\n\nUnitedHealth Group said phone call volumes from members decreased by 10 percent annually, as more consumers accessed services digitally. Optum Rx saw a 16 percent increase in digital engagement registrations, with 1.6 million new consumers onboarded at a third less cost than the prior year due to digital innovations.\n\nUnitedHealth Group continues to invest in AI and digital automation to eliminate administrative tasks and improve consumer experiences. Efforts include scaling solutions like clinical summaries for nurses, digitizing healthcare paperwork, automating claims processing, and enhancing provider and clinician documentation systems. By 2025, the company aims to fully implement these advancements for seamless healthcare interactions.\n\nOptum Insight revenues grew from $19 billion in 2024 to an anticipated $22 billion in 2025, with a $35 billion backlog driven by new products and a rebuilding customer clearinghouse business. These solutions are designed to improve consumer experiences, streamline payments and claims, and accelerate innovation in life sciences.\n\nOptum Insight revenues dropped 1 percent to $18.8 billion, reflecting the business disruption effects of the cyberattack, which were $867 million. Operating earnings were $3.1 billion and adjusted operating earnings, which exclude cyberattack direct response costs, were $4.4 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s revenues are projected to rise from nearly $300 billion in 2024 to $340 billion in 2025, driven by growth in both commercial and public sectors, serving an additional 1.9 million people.

Scott, M.D.\n\nPresident, American Medical Association\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news that UnitedHealth Group is finally looking for ways to simplify and accelerate their prior authorization process. But seven years after a consensus statement (PDF) in which the insurance industry agreed to key reforms to improve this onerous process\u2014and with the burden and outcomes only worsening\u2014patients, physicians and policymakers are looking for specifics and meaningful, impactful changes that will break down unnecessary roadblocks and keep medical decisions between patients and physicians.\n\n\u201cImproving the prior authorization process requires meaningful actions like significantly reducing the volume of requirements, using transparent and evidenced-based clinical criteria, ensuring that qualified physicians are the only ones making denials, and requiring that decisions are made within hours, not days or weeks. Moreover, these reforms must be made across all markets, including self-funded plans, and laws must be adhered to when they are in place. In survey after survey (PDF), physicians have said prior authorization barriers have led to life-threatening events for patients and mountains of paperwork that waste staff time and fuel a physician burnout crisis. Prior authorization programs are optional for plans, but accessing healthcare is not optional for patients. Health plans need to leave the medical decision-making up to physicians and their patients.\n\n\u201cWhile talking about forward progress on this issue is a positive step, it must be followed by substantive actions. A new year demands a new approach\u2014enough with promises that nibble around the edges of the problem and benefit few if any. Our patients deserve broad and meaningful prior authorization reforms, and we urge health insurers to get on board with immediate actions.\u201d",

It breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings but missed the same for revenues. UNH shares dropped nearly 6% on the day following the results.\n\n\n\nThis has put the ETFs having the largest allocation to this health insurance giant, like iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF IHF, Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV, iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF IYH, Vanguard Health Care ETF VHT and Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF FHLC, in focus.\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nEarnings in Focus\n\nEarnings per share came in at $6.81, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.71 and higher than the year-ago earnings of $6.16. Revenues grew 6.8% year over year to $100.8 billion but were shy of the estimated $102.2 billion. The revenue miss was due to weakness in its health insurance business (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).\n\n\n\nOptum revenues increased 9.4% to $65.1 billion. Optum Health served 4.7 million people in 2024 with value-based care and expects to grow to serve an additional 650,000 patients in 2025. Medical ratio (a measure of the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services) rose to 87.6%. Management forecast that the ratio will be in the range of 86%-87% for 2025.\n\n\n\nThe health insurer affirmed its 2025 revenues in the range of $450-$455 billion and earnings per share of $29.50-$30.00.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nLet\u2019s delve into each ETF below:\n\n\n\niShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF)\n\n\n\niShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment.

It charges 40 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.\n\n\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV)\n\n\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR Fund is the most popular healthcare ETF and follows the Health Care Select Sector Index. It holds 61 securities in its basket, with UnitedHealth taking the second spot at 9.7% of the assets. Pharma, healthcare equipment & supplies, healthcare providers & services, and biotechnology take the largest share at 30%, 22.8%, 21.1% and 15.4%, respectively, from a sector look.\n\n\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has AUM of $38.2 billion in its asset base and trades in a heavy volume of around 8 million shares.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUnitedHealth brought in a record $400.3 billion in revenue in 2024 despite a string of crises for the nation\u2019s largest healthcare company, including a massive cyberattack, heavy congressional and regulatory scrutiny and the shooting of its top insurance executive.\n\nHowever, UnitedHealth\u2019s annual net income plummeted to $14.4 billion \u2014 its smallest profit since 2019 \u2014 as the company spent billions to recover from the cyberattack on claims processing subsidiary Change Healthcare and made less from offering Medicare and Medicaid plans, according to financial results released Thursday morning.\n\nStill, when excluding the cyberattack costs (and other factors UnitedHealth believes aren\u2019t representative of its overall business performance in the year), the Minnesota healthcare behemoth reported adjusted profit of $25.7 billion \u2014 an all-time record.\n\nWithout Change and other factors, UnitedHealth reported record profit last year UnitedHealth\u2019s unadjusted and adjusted net income, 2014-2024\n\nIn a call with investors Thursday morning, executives acknowledged widespread discontent with the U.S. healthcare industry in their first public comments since UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was killed in December.\n\nThe crime, which appears to have been motivated by anger over health insurers delaying and denying medical care, set off a torrent of anti-insurer sentiment online \u2014 and calls from investors for UnitedHealth to reckon with its business practices.\n\nDuring the call, CEO Andrew Witty argued the firestorm was indicative of larger problems with the healthcare system \u2014 not just health insurers \u2014 and placed blame on hospitals for overbilling for care and on drugmakers for setting high list prices for medications.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, healthcare costs more in the U.S. because the price of a single procedure, visit or prescription is higher here than it is in other countries. The core fact is that price, more than utilization, drives system costs higher,\u201d Witty said.\n\nStill, the CEO pledged that UnitedHealth will work this year to improve the speed and accuracy of claims processing, reduce processes that can slow down procedure approvals and better communicate with its members.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the mission of the company, it\u2019s all about trying to improve the health system for everybody,\u201d Witty said. \u201cWe recognize there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done in that regard.\u201d\n\nOptum Rx pledges 100% rebate pass-through\n\nCriticism of UnitedHealth\u2019s business practices has also hit its pharmacy benefit manager, Optum Rx. The company is one of the so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d PBMs, along with Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts and CVS\u2019 Caremark, which jointly account for about 80% of U.S. prescriptions.\n\nLawmakers on the Hill have proposed a number of bills targeting how PBMs do business in a bid to lower drug prices. And earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 which is suing all three companies \u2014 released its latest report on the industry that accuses the Big Three of jacking up the prices of specialty drugs.\n\nAmid Washington\u2019s focus on PBM reform, Optum Rx plans to phase out all models that allow it to retain savings from negotiations with drugmakers over the next three years, Witty said.\n\nThe CEO noted that Optum Rx already passes through 98% of rebate discounts, but the remaining fraction it retains gives critics leverage to argue PBMs are profiteering from their middleman status in the drug supply chain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to fading out those remaining arrangements so that 100% of rebates will go to customers by 2028 at the latest,\u201d Witty said. \u201cThis will help make more transparent who is really responsible for drug pricing in this country: the drug companies themselves.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare\u2019s underwhelming results\n\nUnitedHealth has also been dealing with a more quotidian issue with offering health insurance: errors in predicting the cost of medical care its members used last year.\n\nThese problems dragged into the fourth quarter, with the company recording a medical loss ratio of 87.6%, well above analyst expectations.\n\nSpecifically, the Biden administration\u2019s changes to how health insurers code members\u2019 risk in Medicare Advantage have lowered reimbursement, even as seniors use more medical care than insurers planned.\n\nAnd in Medicaid, states\u2019 payment rates continued to land below the cost of caring for beneficiaries in the safety-net program in the fourth quarter, CFO John Rex said. Higher hospital coding intensity and specialty medication prescribing also drove up medical costs in the quarter.\n\nThe underwhelming results are a bad sign for the rest of the earnings season, which UnitedHealth kicks off each year. Other publicly traded insurers are likely to report similar expense pressures, causing stocks in Humana, CVS, Elevance, Centene and Cigna to dip in premarket trading Thursday.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s financial outlook for 2025 projects further increases in medical costs, with an expected MLR of 86.5% at the midpoint, up from the 85.5% lodged this year.\n\nHowever, executives stressed that UnitedHealthcare plans for 2025 are well-situated to absorb any continuing pressures.\n\nStates continue to increase their Medicaid rates. And MA enrollment during the signup period in the fall was strong, Rex said. That includes a tickup in seniors electing for more managed care options like HMOs, plan designs that limit coverage to specific providers, that result in more predictable spending for the insurer, according to the CFO.\n\n\u201cWe feel very good about how we priced into [2025]. We feel really, really good about how the mix is coming in terms of that growth. That\u2019s a huge difference from [2024],\u201d Witty said.\n\nUnitedHealthcare expects to add about 800,000 MA members this year.\n\nThe insurer closed 2024 with 50.7 million medical members overall.\n\nFinal Change bill: $3.1B\n\nIn one of the greatest hits to its bottom line last year, UnitedHealth\u2019s Change Healthcare was struck with a ransomware attack in February that breached the data of 100 million people and took its systems offline for months, causing a cascade of billing problems for providers nationwide.\n\nFinal cyberattack costs of $3.1 billion in 2024 blew past initial spending estimates. UnitedHealth initially expected $1.6 billion in costs, before revising the outlook to $2.9 billion in October.\n\nThe attack also reignited anticompetitive concerns about UnitedHealth\u2019s 2022 acquisition of Change. The $13 billion deal was opposed by regulators in the Department of Justice who argued it would give UnitedHealth access to vast amounts of data from its health insurance rivals and unprecedented market power in the claims management space. Still, a judge allowed the deal to go through.\n\nUnitedHealth reaffirmed its 2025 outlook following the fourth-quarter results, including revenues of $450 billion to $455 billion this year.",

            "content": "The CEO of UnitedHealth Group said Thursday that shortcomings of America\u2019s health care system must be addressed.\n\nOn the company\u2019s first earnings call since the fatal shooting of UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson, CEO Andrew Witty said that while the U.S. provides world-leading care in many respects, there are systemic flaws that are working to drive up health costs for people in the country.\n\n\u201cThe health system needs to function better,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201cvariety\u201d of state, federal and private sector structures and programs have created a \u201cconfusing,\u201d \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201ccostly\u201d health care landscape.\n\nWitty began the call expressing gratitude for the condolences received in the wake of Thompson\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cMany of you knew Brian personally,\u201d Witty said, referring to the investors on the call. \u201cYou knew how much he meant to all of us and how he devoted his time to help make the health system work better for all of the people we\u2019re privileged to serve.\u201d\n\nThe suspect charged in Thompson's killing, Luigi Mangione, is currently being held without bond in Brooklyn. He faces capital murder charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhile past UnitedHealth earnings calls have featured general remarks about the company\u2019s desire to deliver improved outcomes for its customers, Witty\u2019s comments Thursday acknowledged the broader debate about the state of U.S. health care that has emerged in the wake of Thompson\u2019s shooting.\n\nWitty\u2019s remarks came as United Health reported record 2024 revenues. Shortly before Thompson was killed, its stock price was at an all-time high.\n\nPrior to addressing the company\u2019s financial performance, Witty discussed some of the shortcomings of the profit-driven model of U.S. health care head on.\n\n\u201cParticipants in the system,\u201d he said, derive benefit from high health care costs. While lower prices and improved services can be good for consumers and patients, Witty said, they can \u201cthreaten revenue streams for organizations that depend on charging more for care.\u201d\n\nWitty did not discuss to what extent UnitedHealth itself was a beneficiary of such circumstances.\n\nWhen it comes to drug costs, for example, he said U.S. health care participants \u201cpay disproportionately more than people in other countries,\u201d citing the cost of the weight loss drug GLP, which he said in Europe costs approximately one-tenth its price in the U.S.\n\nWitty directly blamed drug companies for discrepancies like those, while stating that UnitedHealth\u2019s pharmacy-benefit managers (PBM), who help negotiate retail drug prices and who have come under increasing public pressure for their role in setting drug prices, continue to work to pass savings on to customers.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s improved PBM performance \u201cwill help make more transparent who is really responsible for drug pricing in this country: the drug companies themselves,\u201d Witty said, without elaborating.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, a representative for PhRMA, which represents drug companies, pushed back on Witty's assertion.\n\n\"Congress, the FTC, state attorneys general, and others who have looked at this issue have all come to the same conclusion that PBM abuses are driving up costs,\" Alex Schriver, PhRMA senior vice president of public affairs, said in an email.\n\n\"Investigations have exposed big insurer and PBM companies for charging thousands of different prices for the same medicines at the same time. The FTC just released a second report showing the same companies mark up medicines at their own pharmacies 10 times or more.\"\n\n\"These big health care conglomerates make billions in profit from controlling what medicines people get, the price they pay and what pharmacy they can use. That\u2019s why there\u2019s unprecedented bipartisan support for holding them accountable.\"\n\nFor the quarter, UnitedHealth reported worse-than-expected results, sending its shares down more than 4% Thursday.\n\n\u201cHealth care in every country is complex and the solutions are not simple, but you should expect this company to continue to work at it,\u201d Witty stated.\n\nCORRECTION (Jan. 16, 2025, 9 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated how much the weight loss drug GLP costs. It is one-tenth of its U.S. price in Europe, not one-tenth less.",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn its first financial results since its insurance unit CEO was fatally shot in New York City, UnitedHealth Group reported Thursday weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue, prompting its shares to fall in early morning trading despite quarterly profit beating projections.\n\nAndrew Witty, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s CEO, defended the company\u2019s commitment to its consumers following the murder of Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the company\u2019s health insurance division. The attack provoked a withering public outcry, slamming UnitedHealth and other insurers for denying and delaying crucial patient care in the quest for increased profits.\n\nWitty, who praised Thompson for striving to make the health system work better for people, cited the strengths of health care in the US, but also pointed out its flaws.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be less confusing, less complex and less costly,\u201d he said on the earnings call.\n\nWitty also cast blame on drug makers and hospitals for high health care costs, specifically pointing to pricey GLP-1 medications used for diabetes and weight loss. He noted that one of those anti-obesity drugs costs $900 in the US but is one-tenth of that price in Europe.\n\n\u201cUltimately, improving health care means addressing the root cause of health care costs,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamentally, health care costs more in the US because the price of a single procedure, visit or prescription is higher here than it is in other countries.\u201d\n\nRising medical costs continue to plague the company\u2019s UnitedHealthcare division, as policyholders utilize more health care.\n\nWitty also addressed consumers\u2019 vocal complaints about claims denials and delayed care.\n\nLess than one half of 1% of claims are ultimately rejected because they are deemed not to be safe or effective treatment options, he said.\n\nBut he acknowledged that other claims are \u201cheld up in the process,\u201d saying that the \u201coverwhelming majority of those claims which are held up are held up because they were either sent to the wrong company, they didn\u2019t have the right information on them, the patient didn\u2019t have the right benefits.\u201d\n\nTechnology and a standardized approach across the industry can improve the process, he noted. At several points during the earnings call, Witty and other executives pointed to the company\u2019s increasing use of artificial intelligence and other technology in an effort to enhance customer experiences and interactions.\n\nThe growing use of AI in health insurance decision making has come under criticism for leading to improper treatment denials.\n\nWitty also cited several challenges in 2024, including the Biden administration\u2019s Medicare rate cuts, reductions in Medicaid enrollment and a massive cyber attack that hit its Change Healthcare unit early last year.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s revenue grew nearly 7% to $100.8 billion for the fourth quarter from the same period a year prior, while its earnings inched up less than 2% to $5.5 billion. Adjusted quarterly earnings came in at $6.81 per share.\n\nAnalysts had expected quarterly earnings of $6.73 per share on $101.6 billion in earnings, according to FactSet.\n\nThe company affirmed its 2025 outlook.\n\nCalls for change\n\nThough the flurry of social media criticism has moderated in the weeks since the murder, the calls for change continued ahead of the company\u2019s earnings announcement.\n\nLuigi Mangione, 26, was arrested last month in connection with Thompson\u2019s killing and is in federal prison in New York City. He has pleaded not guilty to state murder and terror charges but has yet to enter a plea on federal murder charges.\n\nA group of institutional investors with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility last week filed a proxy proposal requesting that UnitedHealth Group\u2019s board draft a report on the public health costs and economic risks created by the company\u2019s practices that limit or delay access to care. The investors asked for an evaluation of how the practices affect patient outcomes, including how often denials of coverage or the need for authorization prior to treatment lead to delays or the forgoing of treatment with serious adverse effects.\n\n\u201cAs the tragic murder of UNH\u2019s Brian Thompson made evident, public outrage over the exorbitant costs and restricted access to healthcare has reached a dangerous level in our country,\u201d Timnit Ghermay, director of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, a center member, said in a statement. \u201cOur proposal suggests some introspection by UNH that will help the company and all its stakeholders thrive.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, a coalition of patients, doctors and advocates gathered outside the New York Stock Exchange to highlight the human impact of care denials by health insurers.\n\n\u201cEach year, private insurers like UnitedHealth deny care to millions, forcing individuals to face delayed treatments, financial ruin, and life-threatening uncertainty,\u201d organizer People\u2019s Action Institute said in an advisory. \u201cThis small, symbolic action on Wall Street is intentionally modest in scale but will send a powerful message, spotlighting the urgent need for reform.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare last month said that it \u201capproves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission,\u201d noting that \u201caround one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons.\u201d However, the company did not return requests for information on its denial rate for authorization requests prior to treatment.\n\nNot a perfect health system\n\nShortly after Thompson\u2019s murder, Witty said the US health system \u201cis not perfect\u201d and acknowledged that the coverage decisions \u201care not well understood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people\u2019s frustrations with it,\u201d Witty wrote in a guest essay in the New York Times last month. \u201cNo one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It\u2019s a patchwork built over decades.\u201d\n\nWitty also defended UnitedHealthcare, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.\n\n\u201cTogether with employers, governments and others who pay for care, we need to improve how we explain what insurance covers and how decisions are made,\u201d Witty wrote.\n\n\u201cBehind each decision lies a comprehensive and continually updated body of clinical evidence focused on achieving the best health outcomes and ensuring patient safety.\u201d",

            "content": "--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) reported full year and fourth quarter 2024 results reflecting diversified growth in serving people more extensively at Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\u201cThe people of UnitedHealth Group remain focused on making high-quality, affordable health care more available to more people while making the health system easier to navigate for patients and providers, positioning us well for growth in 2025,\u201d said Andrew Witty, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.\n\nUnitedHealth Group affirmed the 2025 performance outlook established in December 2024, including revenues of $450 billion to $455 billion, net earnings of $28.15 to $28.65 per share, adjusted net earnings of $29.50 to $30.00 per share and cash flow from operations of $32 billion to $33 billion.\n\nQuarterly and Annual Financial Performance (in billions, except percentages) Three Months Ended Year Ended Dec 31,\n\n2024 Dec 31,\n\n2024 (Adj) Dec 31,\n\n2023 Dec 31,\n\n2024 Dec 31,\n\n2024 (Adj) Dec 31,\n\n2023 Revenues $100.8 $100.8 $94.4 $400.3 $400.5 $371.6 Earnings from Operations $7.8 $8.3 $7.7 $32.3 $34.4 $32.4 Net Margin 5.5% 5.9% 5.8% 3.6% 6.1% 6.0% Expand\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s 2024 revenues grew $28.7 billion or 8% year-over-year to $400.3 billion, driven primarily by serving people more comprehensively across the enterprise. Full year 2024 earnings from operations were $32.3 billion. Adjusted earnings from operations of $34.4 billion exclude the cyberattack direct response costs and South American impacts.\n\nThe full year medical care ratio was 85.5% compared to 83.2% in 2023. The increase was primarily due to previously discussed items, including the revenue effects of CMS\u2019s Medicare funding reductions, member mix and timing of Medicaid redeterminations. Factors cited on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings call, including increased hospital coding intensity and specialty medication prescribing, continued at similar levels in the fourth quarter and are reflected in the company\u2019s 2025 outlook. Days claims payable of 47.0 compared to 47.4 in third quarter 2024 and 47.9 at year end 2023. The company did not have any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe full year 2024 operating cost ratio of 13.2% compared to 14.7% in 2023, reflecting gains from business portfolio refinement and strong improvement in operating efficiencies and consumer experiences. The business portfolio refinement, including strategic transactions, will enhance growth opportunities and contributed about 80 basis points, nearly half at Optum Health with the remainder split between UnitedHealthcare and Optum Insight.\n\nCash flows from operations for the full year were $24.2 billion, or 1.6 times net income. During 2024, the company returned over $16 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Return on equity of 23.7% in the fourth quarter, reflected the company\u2019s consistent, broad-based earnings and efficient capital structure.\n\nUnitedHealthcare provides health care benefits globally, serving individuals and employers, and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. UnitedHealthcare is dedicated to improving the value customers and consumers receive by improving health and wellness, enhancing the quality of care received, simplifying the health care experience and reducing the total cost of care.\n\nQuarterly and Annual Financial Performance (in billions, except percentages) Three Months Ended Year Ended Dec 31, 2024 Dec 31,\n\n2024 (Adj) Dec 31,\n\n2023 Dec 31,\n\n2024 Dec 31,\n\n2024 (Adj) Dec 31,\n\n2023 Revenues $74.1 $74.1 $70.8 $298.2 $298.4 $281.4 Earnings from Operations $3.0 $3.0 $3.1 $15.6 $16.2 $16.4 Operating Margin 4.0% 4.1% 4.4% 5.2% 5.4% 5.8% Expand\n\nUnitedHealthcare full year revenues of $298.2 billion increased $16.8 billion or 6% year-over-year. Operating earnings were $15.6 billion.\n\nThe number of consumers served with domestic commercial benefits grew by 2.4 million in 2024, reflecting strong customer response to the company\u2019s innovative offerings which enhance transparency and consumer choice. In 2025, one in four of our largest fee-based employer customers are offering such plans.\n\nThe number of people served by the company\u2019s offerings for seniors and people with complex needs grew to 9.4 million due to product designs tailored to meet the specific needs of individuals and families with limited economic resources and who are underserved.\n\nPeople served by the company\u2019s state-based community offerings moderated as expected to 7.4 million due to the now concluded Medicaid eligibility redeterminations process, partially offset by new and expanded customer relationships. UnitedHealthcare expanded with state customers including Michigan, Idaho, Nevada and Georgia in 2024, providing momentum the company expects will lead to a return to growth in people served in 2025.\n\nThe Optum health services businesses serve the global health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers. Using market-leading information, analytics and technology to yield clinical insights, Optum helps improve overall health system performance by optimizing care quality, reducing care costs and improving the consumer experience.\n\nQuarterly and Annual Financial Performance (in billions, except percentages) Three Months Ended Year Ended Dec 31,\n\n2024 Dec 31,\n\n2024 (Adj) Dec 31,\n\n2023 Dec 31,\n\n2024 Dec 31,\n\n2024 (Adj) Dec 31,\n\n2023 Revenues $65.1 $65.1 $59.5 $253.0 $253.0 $226.6 Earnings from Operations $4.8 $5.2 $4.6 $16.7 $18.2 $15.9 Operating Margin 7.4% 8.0% 7.7% 6.6% 7.2% 7.0% Expand\n\nOptum full year revenues of $253 billion grew $26.3 billion or 12% year-over-year, led by Optum Rx and Optum Health.

At the end of 2024, Optum Health served 4.7 million people with value-base care and expects to grow to serve an additional 650,000 patients in 2025.\n\nOptum Insight revenues were $18.8 billion, with the 1% year-over-year decline reflecting the business disruption effects of the cyberattack, which were $867 million. Operating earnings were $3.1 billion and adjusted operating earnings, which exclude cyberattack direct response costs, were $4.4 billion. The revenue backlog grew by $700 million over last year, largely due to new health system partnerships.\n\nOptum Rx revenues increased 15% in 2024 due to growth in new clients as well as expanded relationships with existing clients. Optum Rx continued to advance its comprehensive scope of pharmacy services offered, including specialty and community-based pharmacies. Adjusted scripts grew to 1.62 billion, compared to 1.54 billion last year.\n\nAbout UnitedHealth Group\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone through two distinct and complementary businesses.

Expand\n\nUNITEDHEALTH GROUP\n\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net margin and adjusted revenues are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments made to these measures are as follows:\n\n\n\nIntangible Amortization: Adjusted net earnings per share excludes intangible amortization from the relevant GAAP measure. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company\u2019s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion presents a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company\u2019s revenue generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.\n\n\n\nSouth American Impacts: Adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted net margin excludes the effects of various international transactions, including the loss on sale of our Brazilian operations that was completed on February 6, 2024, the loss on our remaining South American operations being classified as held for sale and certain other non-recurring matters impacting our South American operations. Adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted operating margin and adjusted revenues excludes the effects of certain non-recurring matters impacting our South American operations. As these matters are related to the Company's strategy to exit South America, the impact is not representative of the Company's underlying business performance and therefore management believes the exclusion presents a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period.\n\n\n\nDirect Response Costs - Cyberattack: Adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted operating margin and adjusted net margin excludes cyberattack direct response costs. Management believes the exclusion of costs incurred to investigate and remediate the attack, other direct and incremental costs incurred as a result of the cyberattack and incremental costs for accommodations to support care providers presents a more useful comparison of the Company's and its reportable segments' underlying business performance and trends from period to period.\n\n\n\nNote: See pages 4 and 5 for reconciliation of GAAP amounts to adjusted revenues, adjusted earnings from operations and adjusted operating margin.

            "content": "UnitedHealth posted a better-than-expected profit in the final quarter of 2024, but a nagging rise in medical costs and care utilization surprised Wall Street.\n\nShares of the health care giant slid Thursday after it released its first financial report since the brazen shooting of one of its executives outside a New York City hotel touched a national nerve and brought to the surface American frustration over health care access.\n\nUnitedHealth leaders opened a call with analysts Thursday by offering thanks for condolences the company has received since the Dec. 4 death of Brian Thompson, CEO of the company\u2019s UnitedHealthcare business.\n\n\u201cBrian helped build this company and forged deep, trusted relationships for over 20 years, and the positive impact he had on people will be felt for years to come,\u201d Chief Financial Officer John Rex said.\n\nIn the recently concluded fourth quarter, more than 87% of the premiums UnitedHealth collected went back out the door to cover medical costs. That was \u201cwell above\u201d what analysts expected, TD Cowen analyst Ryan Langston said in a research note.\n\nUnitedHealth said it was still dealing with an increase in prescriptions for expensive specialty drugs, rate cuts to its federally funded Medicare business and other cost pressures it detailed in previous quarters.\n\nThe company\u2019s enrollment in the state and federally funded Medicaid programs dropped by about 400,000 people. UnitedHealth leaders said rate updates from states to cover costs from those remaining have lagged.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s adjusted results, which exclude one-time items, totaled $6.81 per share in the quarter. The company\u2019s revenue climbed about 7% to $100.8 billion, which missed expectations.\n\nAnalysts expected earnings of $6.73 per share on $101.6 billion in revenue, according to the data firm FactSet.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. operates the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, UnitedHealthcare, which covers more than 49 million people in the United States. It also operates a large pharmacy benefit manager that runs prescription drug coverage and a growing business that delivers care and provides technical support.\n\nThe company\u2019s full-year profit sank 36% to $14.4 billion in 2024 after climbing every year for nearly a decade. The bottom line was hurt partly by costs tied to a massive cyberattack that hit its Change Healthcare business early in the year\n\nUnitedHealth, based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, surprised Wall Street early last year by reporting soaring medical costs in the final quarter of 2023. Weeks later, the company discovered the cyberattack, which disrupted business and added more than $2 billion in direct response costs.\n\nThen in early December, Thompson was fatally shot as he walked to the company\u2019s annual investor meeting in mid-town Manhattan. A 26-year-old suspect, Luigi Mangione, faces federal and state charges in connection with Thompson\u2019s death.\n\nThe shooting gave rise to an outpouring of grievances about insurance companies. A survey conducted a few weeks after the shooting found that most Americans believe health insurance profits or coverage denials bear some responsibility for Thompson\u2019s death.\n\nShares of UnitedHealth, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, sank after Thompson\u2019s shooting and fell about 4% on the year.\n\nThe stock had rallied so far in 2025 before falling nearly 5% to $517.76 Thursday morning. Shares of other other health care conglomerates like CVS Health and Cigna also were down.",

Sir Andrew Witty spoke to analysts as the firm reported mixed results, just weeks after the shooting of Brian Thompson brought attention to the industry. Some customers responded to the killing by sharing stories accusing the company of rejecting requests to pay for medical care. Sir Andrew said UnitedHealth had helped lower costs, blaming drug firms and health providers for high prices.\n\nBut Mr Witty also said the largely private health system in the US needed to be \"less confusing, less complex and less costly\", acknowledging frustrations with the process for reviewing requests to approve healthcare. \"Those are key areas for us to work at to improve,\" he said, adding that he saw \"much-heightened energy\" to address the concerns. He also said the company was committed to passing on 100% of the savings it wins during drug price negotiations to customers. It already passes on 98%, he said.",

The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) just proposed a 4.3% hike in Medicare Advantage (MA) payment rates for 2026. That's a game-changer for top-tier companies like CVS and UnitedHealth, setting them up to capture the maximum benefits. For CVS, expect a sharp drop in costs per member and a big bump in its MA medical loss ratio (MLR) for 2025, while UnitedHealth's powerhouse model continues to drive double-digit EPS growth.\n\nLet's talk numbers. CVS has a price target of $64, giving it plenty of room to run. Analysts are projecting a 680 basis points improvement in its MLR next year, thanks to streamlined supplemental benefits. For UnitedHealth, trading just below its five-year average P/E, its integrated business model isn't just about surviving; it's about thriving. Combine efficiency with resilience, and you've got a company ready to ride the wave of rising MA payments while maintaining a premium over its peers.\n\nSector-wide, the stakes are high. That proposed payment bump? It could pour an extra $21 billion into the Medicare Advantage space by 2026. CVS's dividend yield of 5.16% and operational agility make it a standout, and UnitedHealth's relentless innovation secures its long-term edge. For investors, this is more than a bet on growthit's a play on two market leaders positioned to dominate as the healthcare landscape evolves.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell announced the order from Suffolk Superior Court in a January 6 press release.\n\nThe three companies owned by UnitedHealth Group are HealthMarkets, Inc. and its subsidiaries, The Chesapeake Life Insurance Company, and HealthMarkets Insurance Agency, Inc. f/k/a Insphere Insurance Solutions, Inc.\n\nThe case dealt with allegations of cheating consumers and violating consumer protection laws, mainly during the years leading up to 2019, when UnitedHealth Group purchased Texas-based HealthMarkets Inc., Christopher Snowbeck of the Minnesota Star Tribune wrote on January 13.\n\n\u201cFor years, the defendants preyed on financially vulnerable individuals, deceiving them into buying products they didn\u2019t need or couldn\u2019t afford. This order holds the companies accountable and will provide meaningful restitution to consumers across the Commonwealth,\u201d said AG Campbell in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe AG\u2019s office filed a complaint against the three companies in December 2020, when it was headed by Maura Healey, that alleged the companies were violating Massachusetts consumer protection law by misleading customers into buying \u2018unnecessary health insurance products,\u201d Madeleine Aitken reported for Boston.com on January 7. \u201cHealey alleged that they cheated more than 15,000 Massachusetts residents out of more than $43.5 million since 2011. The Superior Court found all three defendants liable in April 2022.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth Group is appealing against the ruling. \u201cWe disagree with the Massachusetts court\u2019s latest ruling in the litigation involving the HealthMarkets companies,\u201d a UHG spokesperson said in a statement acquired by Boston.com. \u201cThe fundamental errors in this ruling compound those already made by the trial court earlier in this case and have resulted in a decision that is clearly unsupported by the evidence and contrary to established Massachusetts law.\u201d",

The data breach also became the largest known theft of medical data in U.S. history. Change Healthcare paid the hackers a ransom with the aim of preventing them from publishing any more of the stolen data, and in exchange, obtained a copy of the stolen data to begin notifying people whose information was taken.\n\nIn an update to its data breach notice on its website on Tuesday, Change Healthcare said it has \u201cnotified its impacted customers\u201d for whom the company has a postal address on file. The healthcare giant said it \u201cmay not have sufficient addresses for all potentially impacted individuals,\u201d and that the website notice was to \u201cprovide customers and individuals with information about the criminal cyberattack.\u201d\n\nBut if you search the web for the Change Healthcare data breach notice, you\u2019re unlikely to find the web page in search engine results.\n\nTechCrunch\u2019s review of the breach notice\u2019s web page source code reveals Change Healthcare included hidden \u201cnoindex\u201d code on the notice, which tells search engines to ignore the web page, making it more difficult for anyone searching the web for the notice to find it in search results. Change Healthcare had been including the \u201cnoindex\u201d code on its data breach notice since at least November 20, 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Change Healthcare hid the page from search engines. UnitedHealth spokesperson Tyler Mason did not comment on the reason why Change Healthcare included the code to hide the data breach notice. When asked, the spokesperson was unable to provide a specific number of individuals that Change Healthcare had notified of the breach beyond the estimated 100 million number shared with the U.S. government\u2019s health department in October 2024.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights, which oversees federal investigations of data breaches involving protected health information, did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nChange Healthcare has been criticized for being slow to notify affected individuals of the breach \u2014 the company only started to do so four months after it had received a copy of the stolen files. The delay in public disclosure prompted several U.S. states, including California, Massachusetts, Nebraska and New Hampshire, to intervene by notifying residents to stay alert to identity theft and fraud following the data breach.\n\nIn December 2024, Nebraska brought legal action against Change Healthcare for a string of security failings that led to the breach. The state\u2019s attorney general, Mike Hilgers, said Change Healthcare\u2019s lack of adequate notice to affected individuals left the state\u2019s citizens \u201cmore vulnerable to exploitation of the sensitive personal financial, health, and identifying information.\u201d\n\nCorrected link to California\u2019s notice in eighth paragraph.",

The company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in nine of the last 10 quarters.\n\nRead Also: UnitedHealth: The \u2018Number One Company On Sale\u2019 Ahead Of Q4 Earnings Report\n\nKey Items to Watch: Thursday's earnings report marks the first quarterly report from UnitedHealth since the company lost Thompson.\n\nThompson, who was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot and killed on Dec. 4 in New York City. Luigi Mangione was arrested for the murder and is facing state and federal charges that include first degree murder. Mangione faces potential sentences of life in prison without parole and the possibility of the death penalty if found guilty.\n\nAnalysts and investors may be ready to hear if UnitedHealth will address the challenges of replacing Thompson and moving forward after his passing. Sources told Bloomberg the company is not ready to immediately replace Thompson.\n\nUnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty recently reportedly told executives the company will hit financial records in the current fiscal year, which could put the company and stock back in the spotlight a month after Thompson's death.\n\nThe company's revenue through the first nine months is $299 billion, a company record, and up from $277 billion through the first nine months of 2023.\n\nHealth insurance companies like UnitedHealth have come under increased attention and pressure after Thompson's death. A notebook found on Mangione at the time of his arrest mentioned how insurance companies were focused on profits over the public's health.\n\nAn entry in the notebook dated Aug. 15 said: \"The details are finally coming together.\" The entry said procrastination had allowed Mangione to learn more about the company he was targeting; the name of the company was redacted.\n\n\"The target is insurance\u2026it checks every box,\" was also written in the notebook alleged to belong to Mangione, according to the federal complaint against him.\n\nDespite being on trial for murder, Mangione has gained a level of public support, with Thompson's death becoming a rallying cry for critics of the health insurance industry, often accused of denying medical claims.\n\nAlong with navigating the fallout from Thompson's death and the increased attention on insurance claims, UnitedHealth has found itself a target of incoming President Donald Trump, who recently spoke out about pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nTrump said he would \"knock out\" PBMs from the industry, referring to them as drug middlemen, a role they are commonly associated with.\n\n\"You know the middleman, right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies, and they don't do anything except they're a middleman. We're going to knock out the middleman,\" Trump said.\n\nUnitedHealth is also facing bipartisan pressure from Congress to push for the breakup of health care conglomerates over PBM practices.\n\nThe insurance company also faces scrutiny from the Department of Justice, which has blocked United's $3.3 billion deal to acquire Amedisys Inc AMED.\n\nAlong with any commentary on how the new White House administration and public pressure could impact the company's future growth and operations, investors and analysts may be looking for an update on guidance.\n\nUnitedHealth shared 2025 revenue guidance of $450 billion to $455 billion and earnings per share guidance of $28.15 to $28.65 ahead of Thompson's death in December.\n\nUNH, DIA Price Action: UnitedHealth stock trades at $544.11 versus a 52-week trading range of $436.38 to $630.73. UnitedHealth stock is up 4.8% over the last year, but has fallen around 11% since Thompson's death.\n\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA and other ETFs that track the Dow Jones Industrial Average will also be in the spotlight Thursday after UnitedHealth's report. United is the second largest component of the Dow Jones Index due to its price-weighted methodology.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

They were in severe pain and hoped Stockin's treatment would help them. While many questioned their experiences, they often dismissed them because of Stockin's rank and expertise.\n\nOne Navy officer who was being treated for shoulder pain said he pushed back when Stockin asked him to remove his boxers, but ultimately complied.\n\n\"It's embarrassing to discuss. You don't want to be viewed as someone who has been sexually touched inappropriately,\" the officer said.\n\nStockin admitted to asking patients to take off their underwear when it was medically unnecessary to then look at and grope their genitals for his own sexual gratification, the article stated. He has pleaded guilty to 36 counts of abusive sexual contact and 5 counts of indecent viewing, and faces up to almost 14 years in prison.\n\nUnitedHealth Doctors Questioned\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is interviewing at least two former UnitedHealth Group physicians, two sources told STAT.\n\nBoth doctors had been interviewed for STAT's series on UnitedHealth, and they described how patient care deteriorated after being acquired by Optum, a subsidiary of the healthcare giant. They also said they were encouraged to upcode Medicare Advantage patients under the new ownership.\n\n\"We were not truly caring for patients anymore,\" Susan Baumgaertel, MD, who was recently contacted by an attorney from the DOJ's antitrust division, told STAT. \"We were just micromanaging their care to bring in money. It just felt so unconscionable.\"\n\nThe DOJ is investigating UnitedHealth's market power as well as the relationship between its insurance and provider subsidiaries, though it's unknown if the physician interviews are part of that investigation. The company has been under particular scrutiny after the murder of its insurance business CEO Brian Thompson last month.\n\nAccused Gender-Affirming Care Doc Speaks Out\n\nPediatric endocrinologist Hector Granados, MD, first heard that he was being sued by the state's Attorney General from a friend, El Paso Matters reported.\n\nGranados, one of three doctors being sued by the state attorney general for allegedly providing gender-affirming care to minors despite a state ban, denied the allegations against him.\n\n\"I was always respectful of the law and I will continue to be because we follow what it specifically mandates,\" Granados told El Paso Matters. \"You're not able to provide transgender care to minors. We stopped.\"\n\nGranados told the outlet that he even stopped providing gender-affirming care services early -- in May 2023 -- as soon as the Texas bill banning that care passed. He said he didn't want to risk getting his medical license revoked.\n\nGranados is one of only two pediatric endocrinologists in El Paso County. The other one is his former resident who later joined Granados' private practice. The Attorney General's lawsuit calls Granados a \"radical gender activist.\"\n\nPatients and families under his care, mostly for conditions like type 1 diabetes, are worried about the lawsuit and potentially having to travel further for care. Beyond Granados' practice, the next closest pediatric endocrinologists are across the border in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, or a 4-hour drive to Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nRachael Robertson is a writer on the MedPage Today enterprise and investigative team, also covering OB/GYN news.

Rowe Price highlighted that since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns for US stocks. From 1980 to 2019, a period marked by a significant decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the returns from the broader market. The report further mentioned that dividends become especially valuable in a low-interest-rate environment, offering a steady cash flow when other fixed-income options are less attractive. Once companies start paying dividends, they rarely stop, and most increase their payouts over time. Paying dividends can make a stock more appealing to investors, potentially boosting its value. Over the last decade, dividends for the benchmark index have grown annually, with an average compound growth rate of just over 7%. In strong markets, dividends have enhanced total returns, while in years with low or negative returns, such as 2020 and 2022, dividends played a larger role in total returns, helping to bolster portfolio resilience.\n\nNo matter how the market trends, investors tend to gravitate towards safe stocks that offer stability, particularly during challenging times. Among these secure investment choices, dividend stocks are especially favored. These stocks are typically issued by companies with a reliable history of consistent dividend payments, often from well-established sectors such as utilities, consumer goods, or healthcare.\n\nThe year 2024 was exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market climbing over 23% and the tech-focused NASDAQ gaining 29%. These impressive results were driven by the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group of stocks, which rose nearly 67%, alongside several other large-cap stocks. It marked the second consecutive year of over 20% gains for the broader market, a feat not seen since the late 1990s. Analysts and investors are optimistic about the market\u2019s future, as 2024 demonstrated remarkable strength, suggesting the positive trend could continue. However, despite the current upbeat outlook, investor sentiment could shift quickly due to factors such as global tensions, economic developments, or unforeseen events.\n\nWe recently published a list of 12 Best Safe Dividend Stocks for 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best safe dividend stocks for 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRegarding the safety of dividend stocks, analysts recommend that investors prioritize dividend growth rather than chasing yield traps. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar\u2019s Index team, stressed the importance of focusing on dividend growth, highlighting that it is a distinct strategy from high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth reflects a company\u2019s strong competitive position and positive future prospects. A dividend growth portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector distribution and growth versus value characteristics, such as price-to-earnings ratios. While it has a value-oriented approach, it is more balanced and core-focused compared to a high-dividend portfolio.\n\nCompanies with a history of consistently raising their dividends have typically outperformed those that don\u2019t pay dividends, all while experiencing less volatility. While dividends are not guaranteed and can fluctuate, especially in the current environment, they have played a substantial role in enhancing overall equity returns over the years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 to find stocks with sustainable payout ratios popular among hedge funds. Our focus was on companies that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. From this initial selection, we narrowed down the list to include only those companies with a 5-year average payout ratio below 60%, indicating a robust cash position. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\n5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 33.15%\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a Minnesota-based health insurance company. It boasts a solid dividend track record. It began distributing annual dividends in 1990 and transitioned to quarterly payments in 2010. Since that shift, the company has consistently increased its dividend each year, earning it a spot as one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Its quarterly dividend comes in at $2.10 per share for a dividend yield of 1.55%, as of January 13.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) has surged by over 4% in the past 12 months. In the third quarter of 2024, the company delivered strong earnings, with revenue reaching $100.8 billion, a 9.16% increase compared to the same period last year. Its domestic commercial services saw significant growth, gaining 2.4 million new customers this year. For the full year 2024, net earnings are projected to be between $15.50 and $15.75 per share, taking into account the sale of its South American operations earlier in the year and the impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.\n\nPGIM Jennison Health Sciences Fund highlighted UNH in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is the largest health care services company in the U.S. The company offers healthcare benefits to Americans who receive insurance from employers or government-based programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Half of the company is represented from non-benefits businesses under the Optum umbrella. This includes a technology business that helps hospitals, pharma companies, and other payors. It also includes a fast-growing provider business where Optum owns surgery centers and urgent care centers. The company\u2019s primary care business continues to grow and it\u2019s participating in the emerging trend of primary care taking on risk and acting like an insurance company. Finally, UnitedHealth owns a drug benefits manager. The company continues to have high quality and well-positioned businesses. In the first half of \u201924, UnitedHealth has beat earnings expectations and confirmed full year financial guidance. While medical costs have pressured results, the company has cut a lot of spending to support earnings. We have also seen volatility in the stock related to political dynamics; a view that Republicans are better for this group helped support the stock in June and July and a moderation in policy views from the democratic nominee also helped support the stock. Future catalysts for the company and the stock include potentially stabilizing cost trend, a calmer political environment, and visibility into the company\u2019s long-term earnings growth targets.\u201d\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024, 112 hedge funds owned stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared with 114 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are valued at over $15 billion in total.\n\nOverall, UNH ranks 3rd on our list of best safe dividend stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for UNH to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

In some cases, the FTC said that drugs dispensed at the companies affiliated pharmacies were marked up \u201chundreds and thousands of percent.\u201d The FTC reported that a disproportionate share of specialty drugs marked up more than $1,000 per prescription were done so by PBMs operated by CVS, Cigna, and UnitedHealth, compared to unaffiliated pharmacies.

The report demonstrates how pharmacy benefit managers influence every aspect of the pharmaceutical supply chain, an FTC official said at a press briefing on the report Tuesday.\n\nThe report comes as the FTC is preparing to file a lawsuit alleging the three companies failed to fully comply with the agency\u2019s subpoenas, according to people familiar with the plans. The suit, to be filed in federal court, seeks an order compelling the companies to turn over additional information about their business practices, according to the people, who spoke anonymously to discuss the complaint.\n\nRead More: Drug Middlemen Pay Their Own Pharmacies More, FTC Says\n\nCVS said it has complied with the FTC\u2019s demands by providing more than 2 million documents and 7 terabytes of data. A company spokesman said the lawsuit appeared to be linked to CVS\u2019 attempt to have commissioners of the FTC removed from a related case about insulin costs. CVS said it was \u201cmisleading\u201d for the agency to draw conclusions based on \u201coutliers\u201d without evaluating broader drug spending patterns.\n\nCigna\u2019s Express Scripts called the report \u201canother set of misleading conclusions based on a subset of medications that represent less than 2% of what our health plans spend on medications in a year\u201d and said the FTC had failed to address the underlying causes of rising drug prices.\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s Optum unit said the company is lowering the cost of specialty medications and helped patients save $1.3 billion in 2024, with a typical out-of-pocket payment of $5.\n\nTwo-Year Probe\n\nThe interim report, the product of a more than two-year inquiry by the antitrust and consumer protection agency, is its second looking at pharmacy benefit managers \u2014 the middlemen that negotiate drug prices between manufacturers, pharmacies and insurers.\n\nAn interim report released last summer found that between 2020 and 2022, similar conduct related to two cancer drugs led to $1.6 billion in excess revenue for the pharmacies that share owners with the three largest PBMs. The agency hasn\u2019t issued a final report because it says the companies haven\u2019t turned over all the information it has requested.\n\nPBMs say they lower costs for their clients \u2014 employers and health plans \u2014 by negotiating with drugmakers that otherwise would have no check on the prices they could charge. The industry criticized the FTC\u2019s earlier report, too, saying it cherry-picked examples, and commissioned its own analysis to dispute the agency\u2019s claims.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report focuses on specialty drugs, an ill-defined category that describes costly drugs for complex conditions that sometimes require special handling. Specialty pharmacies owned by the three companies account for nearly 70% of all US specialty drug revenue, according to the FTC. Consolidating with health insurers, pharmacies and other medical businesses lets them favor affiliated businesses under their own corporate parents, the agency said.\n\nDozens of Drugs\n\nThe FTC analyzed 51 specialty generic drugs and found that the companies often marked up prescriptions for them by more than $1,000 compared with the national average acquisition cost. Those inflated prices help drive income at their parent health care companies, with the drugs accounting for 12% of the aggregated operating income of their PBM and pharmacy businesses in 2021, according to the report. Plan sponsors, such as employers and unions, paid $4.8 billion for specialty generic drugs in 2021, while patients paid $297 million, the FTC found.\n\nThe antitrust enforcer also said the conduct featured a form of \u201csteering,\u201d under which it included \u201cpractices that may nudge patients toward making particular pharmacy dispensing choices, in addition to practices that more directly force patient choices.\u201d\n\nThe study is being conducted under the FTC\u2019s so-called 6(b) authority that allows it to issue subpoenas to conduct market studies. These efforts are separate from the agency\u2019s investigative authority, but the reports can be used to support the agency\u2019s own rulemaking as well as possible legislation.\n\nLast year the FTC filed a lawsuit in its in-house court against units of the three companies, accusing them of engaging in illegal rebate programs that drove up the price of insulin.\n\nPressure on PBMs\n\nCongress has weighed legislation to crack down on some PBM business practices and force the companies to be more transparent \u2014 though a PBM reform initially included in a spending package at the end of last year was stripped from the bill at the last minute.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said in December that his administration would \u201cknock out the middleman\u201d in drug purchasing, and his health agencies tried to limit PBMs\u2019 use of drug rebates during his first term. It\u2019s unclear what policies the incoming administration will pursue on PBMs.\n\nFollowing the release of the first interim study, Cigna sued the FTC for defamation, calling the report \u201cunfair, biased, erroneous and defamatory.\u201d All three companies have also sued over the FTC\u2019s insulin case , arguing the agency\u2019s structure is unconstitutional.\n\nThe agency disputes the allegations. In a motion to dismiss Cigna\u2019s defamation suit, it said its interim findings \u201cdid not purport to have legal effect or impose legal obligations\u201d and didn\u2019t force any PBM to take any action.\n\n(Updates with additional company responses starting in fourth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Josh Sisco .\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story:\n\nLeah Nylen in Washington at lnylen2@bloomberg.net;\n\nJohn Tozzi in New York at jtozzi2@bloomberg.net;\n\nIke Swetlitz in Boston at iswetlitz@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story:\n\nSara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net\n\nPeter Jeffrey, Steve Stroth\n\n\u00a9 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

            "content": "At this very moment Luigi Mangione, who is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO last month, is sitting in a federal jail cell in Brooklyn. He\u2019s got a barrage of court appearances scheduled and, once he has wound his way through the criminal justice system, he could be behind bars for the rest of his life.\n\nWhich, of course, is as it should be. While there are a lot of reasons that many people find the 26-year-old alleged assassin sympathetic, you can\u2019t just gun a CEO down outside a hotel in Manhattan and face no consequences for it. And Mangione, who is, by all accounts, an extremely smart guy with an Ivy League education, should really have known better. He should have known that if he wanted to murder someone \u2013 and get away with it \u2013 there were far more socially acceptable ways of doing so.\n\nMangione could, for example, have got a well-paid job as a management consultant and helped supercharge the country\u2019s opioid epidemic; chances are he would have faced little more than a slap on the wrist. He could have gone to Gaza and shot some Palestinian children in the head \u2013 in which case, not only would he probably face no consequences whatsoever, US lawmakers would probably go out of their way to shield him from accountability. And, of course, Mangione could have gone into the health insurance industry himself, and routinely denied life-saving care to desperate people in order to boost profits. That type of violence is perfectly fine.\n\nMangione is now a household name around the globe: there\u2019s pro-Luigi graffiti everywhere from Chicago to London to Rome. According to one recent poll, 48% of college students in the US say they view the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, as totally or somewhat justified. In a more functional world, the outpouring of support for Mangione would have given the folk at UnitedHealthcare (part of UnitedHealth Group and the US\u2019s largest private health insurer based on revenue) pause for thought. On another timeline the endless horror stories shared on social media about how health insurance companies had denied coverage and ruined people\u2019s lives might have pushed the industry to change their business practices. But we live in hell, so none of that happened, did it?\n\nInstead, lawmakers (who get extremely good health insurance thanks to US taxpayers) have made it clear to their corporate overlords that their No 1 priority is ensuring the safety of their donor base. Mangione hasn\u2019t just been charged with murder; he\u2019s been charged with terrorism. Last month New York\u2019s Governor Kathy Hochul made headlines for reportedly considering a special hotline for CEOs to report safety threats. Are you an obscenely rich CEO worried the proletariat may rise against you? Just call 1-800-SAVEOURCEOS and we\u2019ll dispatch 24-hour-security! We\u2019ve de-funded the libraries to pay for it.\n\nMeanwhile, insurers seem to have gone into full-on villain mode; just when you think you can\u2019t hear anything worse about the insurance industry, a new horror story comes out. There\u2019s been an uptick in stories about insurers limiting coverage of prosthetic limbs and questioning their medical necessity, for example. Mr Beast, an influencer with 343 million subscribers on YouTube, recently railed against the healthcare industry in a new video where he helped 2,000 amputees walk again. \u201cMany lived in America and it feels so disgusting that in a country with this much wealth, a fucken YouTuber is their only option to get a prosthetic leg,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe need to fix this.\u201d\n\nAnd last week a plastic surgeon called Dr Elisabeth Potter \u2013 a specialist in reconstructive surgery for breast cancer patients who have had mastectomies \u2013 went viral on TikTok for claiming she had to step out of an operation (where another surgeon was also present) because a health insurance representative demanded proof it was necessary. According to Potter, her patient was under anesthesia when she got an urgent phone call from UnitedHealthcare while in the operating room.\n\n\u201cSo I scrubbed out of my case and I called UnitedHealthcare, and the gentleman said he needed some information about her,\u201d said Potter. \u201cWanted to know her diagnosis and whether her inpatient stay should be justified.\u201d\n\nPotter reportedly explained to the insurance representative that her patient had breast cancer \u2013 something he apparently didn\u2019t know because someone else in a \u201cdifferent department\u201d had that information. This is why health insurance executives get paid so much money, you see. They structure their companies in complicated ways that mean you have to go through at least 50 different people in different departments to try and sort out a claim; in the end, a certain percentage of people just give up because the process is so laborious. That said, actually going through real life customer service representatives is becoming less common. UnitedHealth Group has been under the spotlight for how it uses AI to aggressively deny claims. A lawsuit filed last November claims UnitedHealth illegally denied \u201celderly patients care owed to them under Medicare advantage plans\u201d by deploying an AI model known by the company to have a 90% error rate.\n\nTo be clear: it is difficult to completely validate Potter\u2019s story because of laws that protect patients\u2019 health information. UnitedHealthcare, for their part, seem to reject the doctor\u2019s account of events and have insinuated that Potter was being unprofessional. A spokesperson from the company told me: \u201cThere are no insurance-related circumstances that would require a physician to step out of surgery \u2026 We did not ask, nor would ever expect, a physician to interrupt patient care to answer a call and we will be following up with the provider and hospital to understand why these unorthodox actions were taken.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the virality of the story is yet another reminder of just how frustrated everyone \u2013 from doctors to patients \u2013 is with the profit-driven health insurance industry in the US. Yet, despite this palpable anger there seems to be no appetite by those at the top to change the system. Indeed, it looks likely that Donald Trump\u2019s administration will shrink Medicaid (a government system which helps low-income people access healthcare at a reduced cost or for free) and insurance companies will up their use of AI to deny coverage. Mangione should absolutely be facing consequences for what he is alleged to have done \u2013 but there should also be more legal consequences for those pushing predatory health insurance practices. Killing people with paperwork instead of a gun doesn\u2019t make you any less of a murderer.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nShareholders are asking UnitedHealth to analyze the impact of healthcare delays and denials on public health and the company itself, one month after the healthcare conglomerate\u2019s top insurance executive was shot and killed in Manhattan.\n\nOn Wednesday, a faith-based group of investors requested UnitedHealth prepare a report looking into how its practices \u201cimpact access to healthcare and patient outcomes, including analyses of how often prior authorization requirements or denials of coverage lead to delay or abandonment of medical treatment and serious adverse events for patients,\u201d according to the proposal.\n\nrequested UnitedHealth prepare a report looking into how its practices \u201cimpact access to healthcare and patient outcomes, including analyses of how often prior authorization requirements or denials of coverage lead to delay or abandonment of medical treatment and serious adverse events for patients,\u201d according to the proposal. UnitedHealth will respond to the proposal for its 2025 proxy statement when that document is filed, according to a spokesperson. That document is usually filed in April.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nUnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down in December in a shocking crime that appears to have been motivated by anger about health insurers profiting from curbing medical care.\n\nAs the largest private insurer in the U.S., UnitedHealthcare long been under the microscope on that issue. However, simmering resentment against payers intensified last year amid reports that insurers were using algorithms to decide whether medical care should be covered.\n\nIn October, a Senate committee released a report slamming Medicare Advantage insurers, including UnitedHealthcare, for using algorithms to sharply increase the rate of claims denials between 2019 and 2022. UnitedHealthcare has also been sued over its alleged use of the technology to deny claims.\n\nNow, shareholders affiliated with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a nonprofit coalition of more than 300 investor groups, want answers as to how those tactics could be affecting UnitedHealth\u2019s brand \u2014 and the world at large.\n\nImproper care denials and utilization management practices like prior authorization could be impairing the value of shareholders\u2019 portfolios, while dragging down the broader economy through worsening health outcomes and consumer finances, according to the proposal.\n\n\u201c[UnitedHealth] has been in the media and legislative spotlight for some time given its market dominance, aggressive marketing of Medicare Advantage and questionable use of AI algorithms to deny care to patients,\u201d stated Timnit Ghermay, a representative of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, a Quebec-based group that led the filing. \u201cAs the tragic murder of UNH\u2019s Brian Thompson made evident, public outrage over the exorbitant costs and restricted access to healthcare has reached a dangerous level in our country.\u201d\n\nLuigi Mangione, who has been charged with Thompson\u2019s murder, pleaded not guilty in a New York court last month.",

            "content": "These platforms allow individuals to access healthcare from the comfort of their homes, enhancing customer appeal and providing a stable revenue stream for industry players. However, the substantial investments required for these technological advancements can place pressure on health insurers' profit margins.\n\nIncreasing Costs of Technology Adoption: The adoption of telehealth services continues to significantly expand in alignment with the increasing digitization within the healthcare sector. The convenience and cost-effectiveness of these services suggest that their demand will remain robust in the future. To keep pace with the ongoing digital transformation, HMOs are increasingly investing in technology to develop telehealth platforms.\n\nServices are generally offered by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.\n\nThe Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers\u2019 basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance.\n\nAdditionally, the persistent shortage of medical personnel across the United States remains a significant challenge. Despite these hurdles, companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc. , Humana Inc. and Centene Corp. appear well-placed to counter industry headwinds.\n\nThe U.S. health insurance industry, referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (\u201cHMO\u201d), is poised to benefit from an expanding customer base, ensuring a steady stream of premium income for its participants. Anticipated interest rate cuts in 2025 are likely to revive merger and acquisition (M&A) activity within the sector. While investments in technology aim to enhance operational efficiency, they often lead to increased costs for industry players.\n\nStory Continues\n\nShortage of Healthcare Professionals: The nationwide shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals continues to challenge the efficient operations of hospitals, which face rising patient volumes. Factors such as the aging nursing workforce, high levels of burnout and unequal workforce distribution contribute to this staffing crisis.\n\nHMOs partner with hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers to offer discounted care to their members. The quality and effectiveness of these services are critical to renewing health plans with customers. A reduced nursing workforce can hinder hospitals' ability to provide high-quality care, indirectly impacting the customer retention abilities of HMOs.\n\nMembership Growth: HMO participants offer cost-effective health plans, often enhancing them with attractive features to draw in new members and retain existing ones. These well-designed plans frequently secure federal or state contracts, driving membership growth. As membership expands, insurers benefit from increased premiums, which represent a significant portion of their revenue.\n\nThe aging U.S. population continues to drive demand for Medicare plans tailored to individuals aged 65 and above. However, persistent inflationary pressures could challenge some customers' ability to make uninterrupted premium payments, potentially impacting growth.\n\nStrategic Focus on Mergers and Acquisitions: In addition to technological investments, HMOs frequently pursue M&As to enhance capabilities, expand into new markets, deepen their presence in existing ones, grow their customer base, and strengthen their national footprint. These strategies also provide critical diversification benefits, helping companies maintain a competitive edge.\n\nWith anticipated interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve in 2025, borrowing costs are expected to decline, making it more feasible for industry players to secure loans for M&A activities without depleting cash reserves. J.P. Morgan remains optimistic about M&A activity in 2025.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish Outlook\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #227, which places it in the bottom 9% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nOur research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry\u2019s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.\n\nDespite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it is worth looking at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500, Sector\n\nThe Zacks Medical-HMO industry has declined 7.4% in the past year against the Zacks S&P 500 composite\u2019s 25% growth. The Zacks Medical sector fell 6.7% in the same time frame.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 14.8X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 22.13X and the sector\u2019s 20.34X.\n\nIn the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.57X and as low as 13.07X, the median being 16.2X.\n\n3 Stocks to Watch\n\nWe present three stocks from the space with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Considering the current industry scenario, it might be prudent for investors to retain these stocks in their portfolios, as these are well-placed to generate growth in the long haul.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nUnitedHealth Group: Headquartered in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group benefits from strong performances by its UnitedHealthcare and Optum divisions. The UnitedHealthcare unit offers affordable Medicare and Medicaid plans while Optum drives growth through acquisitions and the use of advanced technology, leading health analytics, innovative care delivery, and data-driven population health strategies. Significant investments in telehealth services have enabled UnitedHealth Group to provide effective virtual healthcare solutions. Additionally, its solid financial position supports an active M&A strategy.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group\u2019s 2025 earnings is pegged at $29.79 per share, indicating a 8% rise from the 2024 estimate. UNH\u2019s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 2.84%.\n\nHumana: Based in Kentucky, Humana has sustained its growth driven by increasing premiums in its Medicaid and Medicare segments. The strong performance of these plans has resulted in multiple contract awards and renewed agreements with federal and state agencies. Through its CenterWell brand, Humana remains committed to serve the nation\u2019s elderly population.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humana\u2019s 2025 earnings is pegged at $16.68 per share, indicating a 3.3% rise from the 2024 estimate. HUM\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark once, the average being 0.17%.\n\nCentene: This Missouri-based company benefits on the back of a strong customer base in its Medicaid and Medicare businesses, which, in turn, boosts premiums. The strength of these businesses has given several contract wins to CNC. Management anticipates premium and service revenues within $154-$156 billion for 2025. It pursues mergers and acquisitions to enhance its capabilities.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene\u2019s 2025 earnings is pegged at $7.04 per share, indicating a 3.3% rise from the 2024 estimate. CNC\u2019s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark once, the average beat being 7.13%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings is currently pegged at $6.72 per shareon revenues of $102.25 billion.\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings estimates have been revised downward by a penny over the past seven days. However, the bottom-line projection indicates an increase of 9.1% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year growth of 8.3%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth\u2019s revenues is pegged at $401.73 billion, implying a rise of 8.1% year over year. Also, the consensus mark for current-year earnings per share is pegged at $27.60, implying a jump of around 9.9% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nUnitedHealthhas a robust history of surpassing earnings estimates, beating the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 2.8%. This is depicted in the figure below.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Quote\n\nQ4 Earnings Whispers for UNH\n\nHowever, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, but that\u2019s not the case here.\n\nUNH has an Earnings ESP of -0.03% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nWhat\u2019s Shaping UNH\u2019s Q4 Results?\n\nUnitedHealth's fourth-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from higher premiums, driven by the expansion of its commercial membership base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premium revenues for the fourth quarter indicates nearly 7% year-over-year growth, whereas our model estimate suggests a 7.8% increase. Higher contributions from both Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare divisions are expected to have supported premium growth.\n\nUNH's fourth-quarter top-line performance is expected to have been enhanced by a rise in service revenues from the Optum brand. The consensus estimate implies a 7.5% jump in service revenues. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for product revenues indicates a more than 15% increase.\n\nValue-based care expansion in Optum Health, new client wins at Optum Rx and enhanced technology-enabled offerings are major tailwinds for the company\u2019s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Optum business segment suggests a 17% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from UnitedHealthcare indicates only 2.1% year-over-year growth. These are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, Optum survived a blow from a cyber-attack on its Change Healthcare business in the first quarter. The company expects to incur direct response costs in the range of $2.15 per share for 2024, along with a business disruption impact of 75 cents. These are expected to have partially affected its profit growth levels in the fourth quarter.\n\nNow, let\u2019s focus on memberships in selected programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare\u2019s total domestic commercial customers suggests 4.7% year-over-year growth, whereas our estimate implies a 4.5% gain. The consensus mark for Medicare Advantage members indicates a 3% year-over-year rise.\n\nHowever, the consensus estimate for Medicaid memberships implies a 4.6% decline from the year-ago level, while our model estimate suggests a 4.9% slip. Also, the consensus mark for international memberships indicates a nearly 79% year-over-year plunge. These are likely to have pulled total memberships down from the year-ago period. Both the consensus estimate and our model estimate imply a more than 4% fall year over year.\n\nRising medical costs, as seniors continue resuming elective procedures, are expected to have elevated UnitedHealth\u2019s overall expenses in the quarter. The expected growth in healthcare utilization, especially in the Medicare Advantage space, might have affected margins, making an earnings beat uncertain this time around. Our model estimate for total operating costs indicates a 7.8% increase from the prior-year period.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH\u2019s medical care ratio is pegged at 86.08%, up from 85% in the year-ago quarter. Our estimates for medical costs and costs of products soldindicate 7.2% and 12.6% year-over-year increases, respectively.\n\nUNH\u2019s Price Performance & Valuation\n\nUnitedHealth's stock has declined 3.5% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s fall of 8.2%. Its peers like Humana Inc. HUM and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH have plunged 40.9% and 25.4%, respectively, during this time. All these stocks have lagged the S&P 500 significantly, which has rallied 23.1% during the same period.\n\nUNH One-Year Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value UnitedHealth offers investors at current levels.\n\nThe company\u2019s valuation looks somewhat stretched compared with the industry average. Currently, UNH is trading at 17.40X forward 12 months earnings, below its five-year median of 19.19X but above the industry\u2019s average of 14.67X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow Should You Play UNH Pre-Q4 Earnings?\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s diversified portfolio and strategic growth initiatives in home healthcare, commercial business and AI-driven analytics offer strong long-term growth potential. Its estimated earnings growth rate of 12.3% for the next five years shows promise. With an estimated 12.3% annual earnings growth over the next five years, the company remains a solid prospect for patient investors. Its robust cash flow supports shareholder-friendly policies like dividends and share buybacks, reflecting its operational resilience.\n\nHowever, near-term challenges could weigh on the stock. Recent cyber-attacks and regulatory investigations have created headwinds alongside margin pressures from lower-than-expected Medicare rates and rising medical costs. A tragic incident involving an executive\u2019s murder also triggered a social media backlash, amplifying scrutiny of the healthcare system. Declining global membership and an increasing medical care ratio add to the concerns.\n\nFor now, current shareholders might consider holding their positions, while potential investors should wait for a more favorable entry point. The regulatory landscape under President-elect Donald Trump adds further uncertainty, particularly around plans to reform pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which could adversely impact UnitedHealth\u2019s OptumRx business. Investors should keep a close watch on upcoming earnings and regulatory developments to assess their implications for UnitedHealth\u2019s performance and long-term prospects.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

Besides UNH, up 4.9%, CVS Health (CVS) rose 6.6%, and Humana (HUM) surged 7.3%.\n\nUnitedHealth Group is the second-largest holding in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which rose 0.6% on Monday despite the NASDAQ slumping 0.8%.\n\nUnitedHealth Group stock news\n\nUNH stock is finally returning to form after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Johnson was gunned down outside an investor meeting in Midtown Manhattan on December 4, leading to a weeklong manhunt that brought light to UnitedHealth\u2019s record of denying health claims and general unpopularity with the public.\n\nThe negative headlines led a group of investors from the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) to ask the UnitedHealth board last week to devise a report on the insurer\u2019s business practices in regard to denying or limiting claims. The ICCR represents $4 trillion in assets under management from its 300 institutional investors.\n\nLast Friday\u2019s announcement from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that it would raise Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates by 4.33% was then greatly welcomed by melancholy shareholders.\n\nThe CMS predicts that its payments to Medicare Advantage plans will rise by $21 billion in 2026 compared with this year due to the change, and the agency said it will seek public comment through February 10. By that time, the Trump administration will have assumed office.\n\nOn December 12, Trump chose celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz as the administrator of the CMS. In his announcement, President-elect Trump said that \u201c[Oz] will also cut waste and fraud within our country's most expensive government agency, which is a third of our nation's healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire national budget.\"\n\nThe Biden administration may be attempting to side-step the incoming administration\u2019s focus on cutting healthcare spending with the new announcement. Reversing this policy may prove unpopular with the American public, especially since Medicare Advantage plans have become quite popular.\n\nUnitedHealth managed 29% of all Medicare Advantage plans in 2024, while Humana managed 18% and CVS managed 12%.\n\nUnitedHealth stock forecast\n\nUnitedHealth stock is back up above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) for the first time since December 11, more than a month ago. That's a good sign as it means the present downtrend may be nearing its end.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is well below the zero threshold, but its bullish crossover is becoming more pronounced. This is a sign that the comeback rally has legs. Between December 4 and December 17, when shares found support near $476, UNH stock corrected more than 20%. Now UNH stock has recovered nearly half that ground lost.\n\nThe 50-day SMA comes next near $557 before the 100-day near $570. UNH shares may consolidate at either of these levels before making a run back to the $600s. Long-term support remains in the $465 to $480 region.",

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Chad Davis (CC BY 2.0) Police outside the corporate headquarters of UnitedHealthcare in Minnetonka, Minnesota, December 2024.\n\nMy mother was excited\u2014a UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage representative was offering her a new Medicare plan that includes dental coverage, which her standard Medicare plan did not.\n\nMedicare Advantage plans are funded by the government and administered privately, and often include benefits that traditional Medicare does not. Rather than pay seniors\u2019 medical expenses as they come up, Medicare Advantage insurers receive a lump sum for each senior they enroll.\n\nMore than half of all those eligible for Medicare are now enrolled in Medicare Advantage rather than traditional Medicare. For younger, healthier seniors, Medical Advantage plans are often less expensive.\n\nMy amiable mother knew nothing of the distinction between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare. She was just glad to be able to chat with the nice person on the phone, excited about the benefits the new plan would provide.\n\nThough I had power of attorney for my mother\u2019s health care, I didn\u2019t learn about the change until weeks later. That\u2019s when I got a panicked midday phone call because one of her doctors couldn\u2019t see her anymore. My mother, a forgetful ninety-one-year-old widow, hadn\u2019t informed me of the change.\n\nSurprised, I called the federal Medicare office to get my mother\u2019s Medicare Advantage enrollment reversed. The person there told me I had missed the open enrollment period, and thus couldn\u2019t switch her back until the next one opened in nine months. UnitedHealthcare (UHC) had mailed her information on her enrollment but I hadn\u2019t seen it. Later, I found it in a pile of my mother\u2019s old newspapers.\n\nExercising what I thought was within my power of attorney, I asked Medicare to put a lock on my mother\u2019s account so she could not again be switched without authorization from me. They told me this is not permitted. As a result, this insurance switch happened two years in a row.\n\nI\u2019d call one Medicare representative after another, pleading, demanding, \u201cWhy can't you stop this!?\u201d I\u2019m embarrassed to admit how astonished I was that Medicare was allowing private companies to mislead vulnerable seniors. (I emailed UnitedHealth Care to explain the thrust of my story and invited it to provide a comment, which it did not do.)\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019d attempt to get my mother, a cancer survivor with a heart problem and a pacemaker, the health care she needed. She had a small corps of doctors with whom she had worked for years and often decades, and it was important that she see them, as opposed to new doctors who knew nothing about her complicated medical history. I quickly learned that this was impossible\u2014she could only see doctors on UHC\u2019s list of providers.\n\nWe had been happy with the physical therapist that Medicare provided; a young gentleman named Adam came to her unit twice a week, got her out of her wheelchair, and guided her as she practiced walking with her walker. Every couple weeks I exchanged text messages with him and he would report my mother\u2019s progress.\n\nOnce my mother signed up with Medicare Advantage, Adam\u2019s visits were abruptly terminated because he wasn\u2019t on UHC\u2019s provider list. I called those who were, but none would treat her unless we came to them for each visit, which was very difficult for my mother to do.\n\nAfter many weeks of battling over this, I brought Adam back by paying him in cash. That helped my mother, but she never got back to the modest level of functionality she had had before her enrollment with UHC.\n\nThere were other difficulties. It was often hard to get whomever I was dealing with to allow me to represent my mother fully. Sometimes I needed to have my mother next to me so we could be on the phone together. Given my schedule and her confusion and distress, this was not easy.\n\nMoreover, navigating such issues involves a lot of phone tag, and at my job it is very difficult to accept or make phone calls during the day. In the American health care system\u2019s coverage denials, appeals, and myriad other limitations, there is an implicit devaluing of the senior\u2019s adult children\u2019s time. In the majority of households, this time-grinding burden falls on women.\n\nI often explained the situation to my mother and begged her not to agree to any Medicare change over the phone. She would apologize and promise not to, but would forget and sign up again.\n\nOne year, in the weeks leading up to and during the open enrollment period, I was so desperate to keep my mother out of Medicare Advantage I even considered disabling her phone.\n\nSimilar situations are happening all over the country. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has flagged the beginning of open enrollment in the fall as \u201cthe start of a marketing barrage as marketing middlemen look to collect seniors\u2019 information in order to bombard them with direct mail, emails, and phone calls to get them to enroll.\u201d\n\nA Commonwealth Fund survey found that during the open enrollment period for 2023, for example, a third of seniors received seven or more phone calls weekly from Medicare Advantage marketers.\n\nThe Medical Advantage salespeople are clever\u2014a couple of my mother\u2019s friends told me that they would get calls from one company or another every fall who would tell them that their Medicare was \u201cexpiring\u201d at the end of the year and ask them if they wanted to \u201crenew\u201d it. When the senior \u201crenewed\u201d it, it would be for that company\u2019s Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nBrandon Novick of the Center for Economic and Policy Research explains that Medicare Advantage companies bombard seniors with ads but don\u2019t disclose the serious drawbacks, such as eliminating enrollees\u2019 ability to choose their own doctors and \u201cdangerous delays and denials of necessary care.\u201d The salesmen calling seniors don\u2019t explain these things either. Novick calls Medical Advantage a \u201cscam.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare, in particular, is known for its high denial rates. In fact, according to a Forbes article from December, recent data shows that \u201cthe insurer refused an estimated one-third of claims submitted . . . a rate nearly double the industry average.\u201d\n\nDr. Craig Albanese, the CEO of Duke Health, told Becker\u2019s Hospital Review that UHC \u201cdenies payment for care 40 percent more than other national insurance carriers we contract with\u201d and that Duke employs 236 full-time workers to appeal all denials from payers.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported last November, the difficulties that Medicare Advantage customers are experiencing in getting their care covered is prompting an exodus of customers, especially those with the greatest health care needs. The paper\u2019s analysis found that Medicare Advantage insurers \u201cactively manage the care, including requiring patients to get approval for certain services and limiting which hospitals and doctors patients can use.\u201d\n\nMany doctors are denouncing the Medicare Advantage programs entrapping their patients. In a recent Journal of the American Medical Association article, the authors\u2014three medical doctors\u2014accuse the programs of cherry-picking and lemon-dropping. That is, they work to avoid accepting customers with greater needs and chasing away those who become too expensive.\n\nThe authors are skeptical about fixing the program, saying the \u201cfailure of past efforts to rein in\u201d Medicare Advantage providers \u201cdoes not bode well for incremental reforms.\u201d Instead, they say, \u201cthe time has come to declare [Medicare Advantage] a failed experiment and abolish it,\u201d while taking steps to improve the government\u2019s Medicare program.\n\nI hope such changes come. For years, I approached every fall with apprehension over how my mother might get ensnared, and what this could mean for her health and perhaps even her survival. My mother\u2019s bad experience with Medical Advantage plans in general and UnitedHealthcare in particular ended when she died in January 2022, at age ninety-three, her last years on earth marred by a profit-hungry industry\u2019s pernicious deception.",

            "content": "To Iowans like Brian Thompson, reputation matters; UnitedHealth must improve its | Opinion Now is the time for UnitedHealth to embrace greater accountability by supporting the expansion of consumer remedies.\n\nI shared a personal and professional connection with UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. We grew up in the same rural Iowa community, graduating from South Hamilton High School six years apart. Our careers carried us to opposite ends of the same spectrum. While Thompson climbed through UnitedHealth\u2019s corporate ranks, I built a law practice helping insurance consumers fight claim denials against industry giants like UnitedHealth.\n\nThompson\u2019s shocking and tragic assassination should have been universally condemned, but it wasn\u2019t. Reactions of laughter and indifference spread across social media, revealing widespread frustration directed at UnitedHealthcare and the entire U.S. health insurance industry. Days later, Brian\u2019s boss \u2014 UnitedHealth Group\u2019s CEO, Sir Andrew Witty \u2014 issued a remarkably tone-deaf response. Sir Witty accepted no responsibility for UnitedHealth\u2019s terrible reputation, though it is a direct consequence of bad behavior that occurred on his watch.\n\nRecent history provides many examples. In 2019, the year he became CEO, a Miami federal judge called UnitedHealth \"immoral and barbaric\" for denying proton beam therapy to treat Richard Cole's prostate cancer. Within the past year, a series of reports from ProPublica detailed UnitedHeath\u2019s concerted efforts to deny coverage for college student Christopher McNaughton's expensive ulcerative colitis treatment, Sharelle Menard\u2019s autistic son\u2019s behavioral therapy, and 15-year-old Emily Dwyer's anorexia treatment. And in October, a Senate committee concluded that UnitedHealth used prior authorization denials to deny Medicare Advantage patients access to post-acute care facilities.\n\nMore: I'm from Brian Thompson's hometown. The celebration of his killing is damning. | Opinion\n\nThe American consumer is not stupid. They have seen UnitedHealth elevating profits over care too many times. Why should they believe UnitedHealth will work to improve their health care experience?\n\nI was not surprised to learn that Thompson raised concerns about UnitedHealth\u2019s lack of consumer confidence and wanted to improve it. Reputation and trust are prized in Iowa\u2019s rural communities, where families are well known to each other across generations and small town pride is worn on every sleeve. Now UnitedHealth has an opportunity to bring about Thompson's vision for positive change if it focuses on his heartland values, starting with accountability.\n\nHealth insurers are often insulated from liability by a federal law known as ERISA. If you get health insurance through your employer, like over 60% of Americans under age 65, then ERISA likely restricts your right to be fairly compensated for your insurer\u2019s wrongful coverage denial. There are no jury trials. You cannot get pain and suffering damages. The insurer could be required to pay your attorneys\u2019 fees, but such awards are discretionary and too infrequent, making it difficult to find representation.\n\nCourts know that ERISA is unfair to consumers, but they are powerless to help. Thirty-five years ago, Florence Corcoran's doctor recommended hospitalization in the late stage of pregnancy because her fetus was at risk. UnitedHealth denied coverage, and Mrs. Corcoran\u2019s fetus died two weeks later. The Corcorans tried to bring an action against UnitedHealth for the wrongful death of their child and they lost. The court explained that ERISA provided the Corcorans with no remedy for UnitedHealth\u2019s mistake, urging Congress to change the law.\n\nCongress tried, in 1999, and Sen. Ted Kennedy\u2019s words from that debate still ring true: \"If a doctor fails to treat a patient with cancer correctly and if the patient dies, you can sue the doctor for malpractice. But if a managed care company decides to pinch pennies and overrule the doctor's recommendations on treating the patient and the patient dies, the insurance company is immune from responsibility. No other industry in America enjoys this immunity from the consequences of its actions.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, the long-serving Iowa Republican, was not persuaded, and the measure failed. Members of Congress had no personal stake in the outcome, of course, because their government health insurance was exempt from ERISA.\n\nNow is the time for UnitedHealth to embrace greater accountability by supporting the expansion of consumer remedies. Demonstrate a commitment to fair claims handling practices that consumers can respect. Send the message that UnitedHealth will not deny claims unless it is proud to stand up and defend that decision in a courtroom. Compete and win in the free market by developing the most effective claims organization, outmatching competitors held back by poor judgment and substantial verdicts.\n\nSir Witty\u2019s essay celebrated Brian Thompson for always considering how he could best serve his hometown of Jewell, Iowa. If Sir Witty doubts that Jewell residents want and deserve greater accountability from their health insurers, then I suggest he pay a visit. I\u2019ll be happy to meet him there and we can find out together.\n\nBen Hassebrock is a shareholder with Ver Ploeg & Marino, a Miami-based law firm representing policyholders with insurance coverage and bad faith disputes.

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Health insurance companies selling private Medicare Advantage plans in the US would see a greater increase in payments in 2026 than in the current year if a proposal released Friday is adopted by the incoming Trump administration.\n\nMedicare Advantage plan payments would rise 4.3% on average, the government said, bolstering revenue for companies including UnitedHealth Group Inc., Humana Inc., and CVS Health Corp. Excluding expected changes in patient risk scores, which increase revenues, payments would increase by 2.2%.\n\nShares of all three companies jumped on the news in trading after New York markets closed. Humana gained 7%, UnitedHealth was up 3.9% and CVS increased 2.7%.\n\nThe proposed increase from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be the largest since 2023. In the past two years, insurers have complained that rates were too meager to cover rising medical costs, and the payment policies have squeezed earnings and weighed on stock prices.\n\nIn recent years, the Biden administration has attempted to constrain payments to Medicare Advantage plans, which lawmakers, watchdogs, and whistleblowers have accused of wasting tax dollars. The rate change for 2025, finalized in April, amounted to a slight cut after excluding changes to risk scores, the measures of patient illness that influence payments.\n\nThe positive update may be welcomed by the industry, and the incoming Trump administration could make the policy more favorable. If today\u2019s proposal is adopted, it would result in an additional $21 billion in payments in 2026 over expected payments in 2025.\n\n\u201cWhile rates in recent years have been considered insufficient\u201d by Medicare insurers, \u201cthere is some optimism that rates could improve under a Trump CMS,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a research note before the proposal Friday.\n\nCMS plans to finish phasing in changes to certain risk coding policies, first proposed in 2023, that insurers opposed. Despite outcry from the industry that changes would destabilize the market, Medicare officials said in a news release that the market remained robust.\n\nThe US is expected to spend $9.2 trillion over the next decade on payments to private Medicare plans, according to CMS. Health care conglomerates UnitedHealth, Humana and CVS sold more than half of the Medicare Advantage plans in 2024, according to KFF, the health policy group.\n\nMedicare Advantage covered more than half of Medicare beneficiaries and cost $455 billion in 2023, not including Part D drug plan payments, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a nonpartisan adviser to Congress.\n\n$83 Billion\n\nThe group said that the US would pay $83 billion more to cover people in Medicare Advantage plans in 2024 than if those people were on traditional Medicare. That\u2019s due to the way that plans select members and record patient illnesses, as well as other aspects of the program that result in higher payments.\n\nThe Medicare Advantage rate proposal is usually released in late January or early February, before a final notice due in April.\n\nDemocratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Lloyd Doggett had asked Biden officials to release the rule quickly, saying that Medicare Advantage plans are overcharging the government by claiming patients are sicker than they actually are, which brings them more funds.\n\nThere is precedent for an outgoing administration to put forward its Medicare Advantage rate proposal in the final days of office. In 2021, the first Trump administration issued its plan on Jan. 15, less than a week before President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration.\n\n(Updates with share moves in third paragraph.)\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

The final rate announcement will be published on or before April 7, 2025.Under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, annual out-of-pocket drug costs will be capped at $2,100 in 2026 for people with Medicare prescription drug plans, known as Part D, the government also said. That is an increase from 2025's $2,000 cap. (Reporting by Puyaan Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Caroline Humer and Devika Syamnath)",

            "content": "These wildly successful companies are poised to keep your dividend portfolio healthy in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThere might not be a better place to find winning stocks that can slowly make you wealthy over decades than the healthcare industry. It's an evergreen, multitrillion-dollar market that promotes growth and innovation because better healthcare saves lives.\n\nIf you want to know which healthcare companies to choose to invest in, the answer is easy: Look for those that keep raising dividends. It's not a sure thing, but it's an excellent litmus test because a company must continually innovate, grow, and manage itself well to afford to give more cash to its shareholders every year.\n\nThese three companies are healthcare leaders. They treat their shareholders well and offer promising growth prospects at attractive valuations. Consider buying them in 2025 to boost your dividend portfolio.\n\n1. Medtronic\n\nYou won't explore the healthcare field for long before encountering Medtronic (MDT 0.80%). The company develops numerous products, devices, and treatment technologies for dozens of conditions. Its product portfolio ranges from cardiovascular pacemaker devices to glucose monitoring systems for people with diabetes. It's a remarkably diverse and consistent business since people need care and treatment around the clock. Since the 1980s, Medtronic's sales haven't dipped more than 10% in a trailing-12-month period.\n\nThat has made it a stellar dividend stock. Medtronic isn't quite a Dividend King yet, but it soon will be. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 47 consecutive years. You can't fake or borrow your way to decades of dividend increases. Medtronic's payout ratio is still just 65% of cash flow, so you can trust that the dividend is secure and will likely keep increasing.\n\nMedtronic isn't growing very fast, but it's positioned well for the future. The company has grown its organic revenue at a mid-single-digit rate for the past eight quarters, and analysts estimate the business will grow earnings by about 6% annually over the long term. Lastly, the stock is priced appropriately for its growth at a forward P/E ratio under 15. The stock's 3.5% dividend yield could push annualized total investment returns to 9% to 10%.\n\n2. UnitedHealth Group\n\nInsurance and healthcare services giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.48%) is a key cog in America's healthcare system. It has grown into one of the world's largest corporations, generating over $389 billion in annual revenue. Its massive size enables it to offer more for less than its competitors, so it continues gobbling up patients' dollars in a system that spent $4.9 trillion in 2023 alone. The company operates two primary segments: UnitedHealthcare (insurance) and Optum (care services and technologies).\n\nThe company's seemingly endless growth has fueled 15 consecutive annual dividend increases, averaging 15% per increase for the past five years. Its 1.6% dividend yield isn't enormous but sustained double-digit growth creates significant income over time. Additionally, the dividend consumes only 56% of the company's cash flow. Since analysts estimate UnitedHealth will grow earnings by 15% annually over the long term, investors should reasonably expect more sizable dividend increases and share price gains.\n\nUnitedHealth's stock declined after the insurance segment's CEO was killed in early December, igniting controversy around health insurance in the United States. Lawmakers have since introduced potential legislation to reel back the power that companies like UnitedHealth have in the industry, though it may not pass into law. The stock's recent slide has brought UnitedHealth's valuation down to a forward P/E of 17, a bargain valuation that helps compensate for the company's political risks.\n\n3. AbbVie\n\nPharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV 0.10%) has remained a stalwart in healthcare due to its ability to innovate and find new growth opportunities. Although it was once part of Abbott Labs, AbbVie has thrived independently since its 2013 split. Today, AbbVie's drug portfolio includes immunology, oncology, cosmetics, neuroscience, and eye care treatments. The company has pivoted masterfully after losing patent protection for Humira, its former top-selling product, in 2023.\n\nFew stocks offer a high dividend yield and strong growth, but AbbVie does. The company is also a Dividend King if you count its years with Abbott Labs, which is another impressive feat. AbbVie's stock currently yields 3.4%, and the company has raised its dividend by an average of 8% annually over the past five years. Those increases have gotten smaller these past few years, but that could change if growth ramps back up. The stock's dividend payout ratio is still manageable at 70% of cash flow.\n\nAbbVie's stock has tumbled after its promising schizophrenia drug, the centerpiece of an $8.7 billion acquisition, failed to meet its primary endpoint in phase 2 trials. It was considered a future blockbuster for AbbVie. However, analysts still expect nearly 9% annualized earnings growth over the long term. That's enough growth to make AbbVie an easy buy at its current forward P/E ratio of less than 15.",

This year\u2019s list includes a Texas medical school involved in unauthorized body part sales, a massive catheter billing fraud, an oncologist accused of providing unnecessary cancer treatments, and a dominant health insurance monopoly.\n\nHosted by the Lown Institute, a Massachusetts-based think tank committed to advocating for a just and compassionate healthcare system, the Shkreli Awards are now in their eighth iteration. A panel of 20 expert judges, including doctors, professors, and activists, selected this year\u2019s most flagrant violators.\n\nThis year\u2019s recipients include:\n\n10: Reports have surfaced that the University of North Texas Health Science Center handled and distributed body parts from deceased individuals without proper consent. These parts were provided not only to medical students but also to large corporations such as Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson.\n\n9: Procedures to correct baby tongue-ties are being aggressively promoted as a solution for a range of issues from breastfeeding problems to sleep disturbances and even constipation, despite a lack of solid evidence supporting the effectiveness of these procedures.\n\n8: Zynex Medical has come under scrutiny for questionable billing practices involving their nerve stimulation devices designed for pain relief.\n\n7: Insurance heavyweight Cigna was criticized for charging a family close to $100,000 for a medevac flight for an infant.\n\n6: A group of seven suppliers has been implicated in a multibillion-dollar scam overbilling Medicare for urinary catheters, affecting hundreds of thousands of patients.\n\n5: Allegations have been made against Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces, New Mexico for denying cancer treatments to insured patients or demanding payment upfront.\n\n4: Dr. Thomas C. Weiner, a Montana-based oncologist, reportedly subjected a patient to unnecessary cancer treatments for over a decade, used excessively high doses of barbiturates on terminally ill patients, and prescribed opioids inappropriately. Weiner has denied these allegations.\n\n3: Pharmaceutical giant Amgen is accused of promoting a 960-milligram dose of its potent cancer medication Lumakras, despite a smaller 240mg dose being nearly as effective with significantly less toxicity, and costing $180,000 less per patient each year.\n\n2: UnitedHealth is alleged to have manipulated its extensive network of physicians to maximize profits by pressuring doctors to minimize patient interaction times and employ aggressive medical coding strategies to exaggerate patient illnesses for higher federal reimbursements.\n\n1: Dr. Ralph de la Torre, CEO of Steward Health Care, has been accused of creating a severe healthcare crisis by prioritizing private equity gains over patient care, involving debt and leaseback strategies that led to hospital closures, layoffs, and community neglect while reportedly earning over $250 million as the organization floundered.\n\n\u201cThese examples underscore the desperate need for reform in the healthcare industry,\u201d stated Dr. Vikas Saini, president of the Lown Institute, during the award ceremony as reported by The Guardian.\n\nDr. Saini further emphasized, \u201cHighlighting these cases annually reminds us that these issues are not new. We aim to shed light on the necessary changes through these stories.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of the Shkreli Awards came shortly after the shocking murder of Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealth subsidiary UnitedHealthcare, an event that ignited national conversations about greed within the for-profit healthcare system after the alleged assailant, Luigi Mangione, who pleaded not guilty, criticized the industry\u2019s greed in a widely discussed manifesto.\n\nSimilar Posts\n\nRate this post",

            "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider UnitedHealth Group (UNH). This company, which is in the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nThis largest U.S. health insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2.05%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, UnitedHealth came out with earnings of $7.15 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.02 per share, representing a surprise of 1.85%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $6.65 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.80 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.26%.\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for UnitedHealth lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nUnitedHealth currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.55%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 16, 2025.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

Both companies argued in a joint filing that the DOJ has failed to show how the $3.3 billion merger would diminish competition in the market.\n\nIn a legal motion submitted Jan. 8, Amedisys and UnitedHealth said the DOJ had failed to specify which regions of the U.S. would suffer as a result of the merger. While the agency cites hundreds of local home-care markets, labor markets and \u201cdozens of hospice markets\u201d that could potentially lack adequate competition due to UnitedHealth\u2019s takeover of Amedisys, the DOJ did not provide more specific details, according to the companies.\n\nThey are asking the court to dismiss the case outright and allow Amedisys to join UnitedHealth under its Optum banner, which includes Change Healthcare, a pharmacy benefit manager group, medical clinics and associated technology.\n\nThe crux of the argument against the DOJ\u2019s complaint lies in the word \u201clocal,\u201d which the companies argue has not been clearly defined and could apply to anything from a single city to a large region of the country. UnitedHealth and Amedisys contend that the court should dismiss the case given the lack of evidence of antitrust law violations.\n\nIn its complaint, the DOJ attached a long list of locations owned by both UnitedHealth and Amedisys, all of which would belong to the former in the event of a merger. However, the companies maintain that this does not prove anything, as the DOJ has failed to \u201callege where competition will be affected, or identify principles for determining where competition occurs.\u201d",

The Nasdaq ended its first week below its 10-week line since September. The S&P 500 and the Dow industrials dug deeper below support. IBD's Stock Market Exposure guide came under added pressure after Friday's session. SwingTrader noted a climate where \"good economic news puts pressure on the market and bond prices.\" The Nasdaq did rebound from its lowest levels on Friday afternoon, but still ended well below the 10-week line.\n\nAs the Nasdaq looks to retake that line in the coming week, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) mark the official launch to the Q4 reporting season on Wednesday. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) report on Thursday. JPMorgan's Biotechnology Conference could generate some market moving news. And earnings from a few other significant names, including BlackRock (BLK) and SLB (SLB), could also help tip the market's scales.\n\n\u2191 X AI Chipmaker Hovers In Buy Zone As Earnings Approach See All Videos NOW PLAYING AI Chipmaker Hovers In Buy Zone As Earnings Approach\n\nEconomic Calendar: Reading Good News As Bad\n\nKey consumer price index and retail sales reports lead the coming week's batch of data as markets have started to frown on any evidence of economic strength and persistent inflation. The Consumer Price Index for December, out Wednesday, is expected to show a 0.2% rise in core prices, following a 0.3% increase in November. Together with Tuesday's producer price index, the week's inflation data will set expectations for the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge, which won't be released until Jan. 31. Retail sales, on Thursday, are expected to rise a strong 0.6%. Also, the NAHB Housing Market Index comes out Thursday, and housing starts, building permits and industrial production are on Friday.\n\nJobs Report: Solid Hiring, Lower Unemployment Will Keep The Fed On Hold\n\nEarnings Season: Bases And Earnings For Banks\n\nThe fourth quarter reporting season gets underway as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo (WFC) report on Wednesday. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) deliver results. Expectations are high across the board, especially for Bank of America, which faces views for a 120% EPS gain. Morgan Stanley has the strongest revenue estimate, targeting a 16% increase. All five banks are sitting in bases atop healthy recent gains. Bank of America was the only stock in the group to gain ground over the last week, giving it a three-week advance ahead of earnings. JPMorgan and Bank of America each rallied more than 72% since the end of October.\n\nStocks To Watch: Resilience In A Choppy Market\n\nThe stock market is in a choppy, downward trend, so investors should be cautious. But stocks like Netflix (NFLX), Constellation Energy (CEG), Howmet Aerospace (HWM), American Express (AXP) and DT Midstream (DTM) show resilience. Constellation Energy broke out Friday, while Netflix, Howmet, American Express and DT Midstream are forming bases.\n\nBiotechnology: Viking CEO Kicks Off JPM Conference\n\nThe 43rd annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference runs Monday through Thursday in San Francisco. Known as JPM, the biggest health care gathering of the year is notorious for high-profile clinical data releases, financial surprises and splashy business deals, including acquisitions. Big names like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) are all scheduled to present. Investors are likely to zero in on news from obesity-focused companies like Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) and Eli Lilly (LLY). Viking Chief Executive Brian Lian gives a presentation midday Monday. David Ricks, Lilly's CEO, is slated for a fireside chat late Tuesday.\n\nSemiconductors: Largest Chip Foundry Faces A High Bar\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, aka TSMC, reports early Thursday. The world's largest chip manufacturer, it counts Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) among its customers. For the December-ended quarter, the FactSet consensus calls for profit of $2.19 a share, up 50%, with revenue up 33% to $26.3 billion. After an 89% gain in 2024, the stock has struggled to break out from a nine-week cup-with-handle base.\n\nJPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Chip Giant TSMC Set To Kick Off Q4 Earnings Season\n\nHealth Care: A Checkup On UnitedHealth\n\nUnitedHealth Group posts Q4 results before the open on Thursday. Analysts expect high single digit earnings and revenue gains. The report comes six weeks after the assassination of Brian Thompson, CEO of the UnitedHealthcare managed care division. UNH stock, a Dow Jones component, tumbled 17% last month as health insurers came under a microscope and bipartisan groups in Congress revved up efforts to restrain the practices of prescription benefit managers, including UnitedHealth's OptumRx. UnitedHealth provided 2025 guidance ahead of its Dec. 4 investor day. Investors may react to how the company fared in the year-end enrollment period, particularly for Medicare Advantage.\n\nStock Market Earnings Briefs\n\nBlackRock reports results early Wednesday as the Q4 reporting season gradually gains momentum. FactSet expects earnings to increase 17% to $11.33 per share on nearly 21% revenue growth to $5.6 billion. BLK stock retreated below its 10-week line in the past week, after climbing 26% in 2024.\n\nJB Hunt (JBHT) reports late Thursday. Analysts expect 10% EPS growth despite a 5% revenue decline for the holiday quarter, which was marred by a dockworkers' strike. That would mark the first earnings gain after eight quarters of declines, and the seventh quarterly sales drop. But the trucking and logistics company is poised for a big earnings comeback in 2025 as its truckload and intermodal businesses both return to growth.\n\nApplied Digital (APLD) announces Q2 results late Tuesday. FactSet expects a loss of 14 cents per share, widening from a loss of 10 cents last year. Revenue is seen leaping 48% to $62.4 million. Shares of the data-center designer are basing ahead of the report.\n\nSLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, reports fourth-quarter earnings and revenue before the market opens on Friday. Analysts expect the oil field services heavyweight to see profit grow around 5% with sales increasing 2%. Investors should look to SLB's 2025 North America outlook with President-elect Donald Trump eyeing U.S. oil production as a focus of his presidency. There may also be news on clean hydrogen, where Schlumberger has a growing presence.\n\nState Street (STT) is expected to report early Friday a nearly 10% increase in earnings to $2.42 per share for its fiscal Q2 results. Analysts estimate the asset manager's revenue will climb 9% to $3.32 billion. STT stock is basing as shares have traded tightly over the past several weeks.

            "content": "The market expects UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 16. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis largest U.S. health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.72 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $102.01 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.72% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

            "content": "A month after the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson prompted many Americans to share personal horror stories of the company's coverage denials and other practices, a doctor in Austin, Texas on Wednesday shared her own experience that she said exemplified how the for-profit health system \"just keeps getting worse.\"\n\nIn a video posted to TikTok, Dr. Elisabeth Potter said she recently received an unprecedented phone call from UnitedHealthcare about a patient\u2014one who was already under anesthesia and having surgery.\n\nPotter, a plastic surgeon who specializes in reconstructive surgery for breast cancer patients who have had mastectomies, said she was performing a bilateral deep inferior epigastric perforator [DIEP} surgery when UnitedHealthcare called her in the operating room.\n\nThe call was urgent, she was told, and needed to be returned right away.\n\n\"So I scrubbed out of my case and I called UnitedHealthcare, and the gentleman said he needed some information about her,\" said Potter. \"Wanted to know her diagnosis and whether her inpatient stay should be justified.\"\n\nPotter found that the person calling wasn't aware that the patient whose care he was questioning had breast cancer and was in the operating room\u2014that information was known by \"a different department\" at UnitedHealthcare.\n\nPotter's account, said Nidhi Hegde, managing director at the American Economic Liberties Project, was \"another horror story from a doctor dealing with United Healthcare's terrible authorization process.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ridiculous that doctors/nurses are spending time explaining their work to an insurance company instead of being able to focus on care,\" said Hegde.\n\nAs Common Dreams reported last month, cancer patients have become disproportionately affected by \"prior authorizations\" demanded by for-profit health insurers, which require doctors to get approval for treatments. Prior authorization can delay lifesaving care and one survey of oncologists in 2022 found that patients experienced \"disease progression\" 80% of the time an insurance company's bureaucratic requirements delayed their treatment.\n\nPotter had to inform the UnitedHealthcare staffer that the company had already given her approval for the surgery.\n\nShe said she told him, \"I need to go back and be with my patient now\" and was able to continue the procedure.\n\n\"But it's out of control,\" she said. \"Insurance is out of control. I have no other words.\"\n\n\n\nEven before Thompson's killing, UnitedHealthcare has garnered outrage for the numerous methods it uses to deny healthcare coverage to patients.\n\nA Senate investigation found the company intentionally denied claims submitted by nursing home patients who suffered strokes and falls, in order to increase profits. The company also faces a class-action lawsuit for using an AI algorithm with a 90% error rate to deny coverage to senior citizens with Medicare Advantage plans,\n\nIn December, ProPublica published an investigation that found the company is one of several insurers who repeatedly relied on the advice of company doctors who have wrongly recommended denying care.\n\n\n\nIn a follow-up video, Potter said on Wednesday that insurance companies have created \"a fear-based system where, if an insurance company calls me and says I've got to call them right back, I'm afraid they're not going to pay for my patient's surgery, that patient is going to get stuck with a bill.\"\n\nPotter toldNewsweek that the experience confirmed for her that \"there is no room in healthcare where the pressure of insurance isn't felt by both patients and doctors. Not even the operating room.\"\n\nUnitedHealthcare suggested in a comment to Newsweek that it did not call Potter during surgery, saying, \"There are no insurance related circumstances that would require a physician to step out of surgery and it would create potential safety risks if they were to do so. We did not ask nor would ever expect a physician to interrupt patient care to answer a call and we will be following up with the provider and hospital to understand why these unorthodox actions were taken.\"\n\nPotter joined many Americans in speaking out against the for-profit health insurance system in the days after Thompson's killing, offering a doctor's perspective.\n\n\"I want you to know that insurance companies are affecting the kind of care that you're getting, because they're applying pressures to physicians through their policymaking,\" said Potter in one video posted on TikTok. \"This is a dark, dark time for healthcare, and we have to fix this or we're gonna go down a path that we can't get back from.\"\n\n",

UHG, the largest health insurer in the U.S. and largest employer of physicians, influences healthcare outcomes through its impacts on healthcare and treatment accessibility and affordability. Given UHG\u2019s size and broad reach\u2014\u2018more than 5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product flows through the company\u2019s systems every day\u2019\u2014shareholders fear UHG\u2019s practices may impair the value of their portfolios\u201d.\n\nThe investor group is concerned about the effects on the financial markets of UnitedHealth\u2019s practices, including;\n\nAuthorization requirements that result in delayed or avoided medical care;\n\nDenying patient care to increase profit; and\n\nIncreasing premiums and out-of-pocket costs, which hinders economic growth.\n\nUnitedHealth Group \u201chas been in the media and legislative spotlight for some time given its market dominance, aggressive marketing of Medicare Advantage and questionable use of [artificial intelligence] algorithms to deny care to patients,\u201d said the proposal\u2019s lead filer, Timnit Ghermay of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary congregation, in a statement.\n\nThe December 2024 murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson put an additional spotlight on the company, one of the companies that has denied the most insurance claims.\n\n\u201cAs the tragic murder of [United Healthcare\u2019s] Brian Thompson made evident, public outrage over the exorbitant costs and restricted access to health care has reached a dangerous level in our country,\u201d Ghermay continued. \u201cOur proposal suggests some introspection \u2026 that will help the company and all its stakeholders thrive.\u201d\n\nIn the shareholder proposal, the ICCR noted that patients often have to cover health care costs by taking on credit card debt, cutting back on discretionary spending and draining their retirement savings, actions which negatively impact the economy.\n\n\u201cWorsening health outcomes, loss of wages or underemployment, low credit ratings due to inability to pay medical debt, and the associated inability to attain stable housing, may all lead to depressed worker productivity, reduced consumer spending power, and greater reliance on public assistance programs which are clear drags on the broader economy,\u201d according to the shareholder proposal.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nHollywood Firefighter Pension Lawsuit Alleges Insider Trading by United Health Execs, Including Slain CEO\n\nExxonMobil CEO: Proxy Activists in Lawsuit Are Not Responsible Shareholders\n\nVoting Support for NYC Pension Proxy Proposals Continues to Wane\n\nTags: Health Care, ICCR, Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, shareholder proposals, UnitedHealth Group",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nUnitedHealth and home health provider Amedisys have agreed to push back the closure date of their $3.3 billion merger, according to a securities filing last month.\n\nThe delay comes after the Department of Justice and three states sued to block the deal late last year, arguing it would give UnitedHealth too much control of the home health and hospice market.\n\nThe new waiver agreement extends the deadline to merge to the tenth day after a U.S. district court decides that lawsuit, or Dec. 31, 2025 \u2014 whichever is earlier. Previously, the companies had expected to merge by the end of 2024.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAmedisys agreed to be acquired by UnitedHealth in June 2023, after the Minnesota-based healthcare giant outbid a preexisting deal with Option Care Health. However, regulators in the Biden administration closely scrutinized the deal before ultimately suing to block it in November.\n\nUnitedHealth already owns LHC Group, a rival to Amedisys that UnitedHealth acquired for $5.4 billion in 2023. LHC and Amedisys are two of the biggest home health companies in the country. Combining them under one roof would harm patients and providers by eliminating competition, according to the DOJ.\n\nUnitedHealth and Amedisys deny that their merger would have anticompetitive effects.\n\nHowever, regulators have grown increasingly concerned about the size and influence of UnitedHealth, a company that operates one of the largest insurers in the nation, a major pharmacy benefit manager and a healthcare technology company, while employing thousands of physicians.\n\nThe DOJ is reportedly investigating the conglomerate for its potential anticompetitive effects, including the relationship between insurer UnitedHealthcare and health services division Optum. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is suing UnitedHealth\u2019s PBM, Optum Rx, along with other PBMs for allegedly driving up the price of insulin.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if regulators under President-elect Donald Trump, who assumes office later this month, will continue the antitrust crusade against UnitedHealth. Trump\u2019s antitrust regime is generally expected to be friendlier to consolidation than the Biden administration.\n\nEfforts by the DOJ to block previous UnitedHealth buys have failed in the past. Regulators sued to stop UnitedHealth\u2019s acquisition of healthcare technology firm Change Healthcare in 2022, but a judge allowed the deal to go through.\n\nThe amendment to UnitedHealth and Amedisys\u2019 merger agreement also increases the fee if their merger fails for regulatory reasons to $275 million. It could rise up to $325 million if UnitedHealth fails to divest the assets needed to close the deal by May 1.",

The agreement included potentially more than 100 locations.\n\nThe VitalCaring transaction was contingent on approval of Amedisys\u2019 $3.3 billion acquisition by the UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) subsidiary Optum. Amedisys planned to move forward with the VitalCaring divestiture in order to mitigate federal antitrust concerns surrounding its sale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news to cancel the divestiture comes after a recent court order issued by a federal judge in Delaware requiring that VitalCaring allocate 43% of future profits to Encompass Health (NYSE: EHC) and Enhabit Inc. (NYSE: EHAB). The two companies alleged in a lawsuit that the founders of VitalCaring, including CEO April Anthony, used unethical practices to establish the company, adversely affecting both companies. Anthony previously served as CEO Encompass\u2019 home-based care segment.\n\n\u201cOn January 3, 2025, UnitedHealth Group delivered a notice to VCG Luna terminating the VCG Purchase Agreement, following which, on January 8, 2025, UnitedHealth Group and VCG Luna entered into an agreement which provides for, among other things, the mutual release by the parties thereto of all claims against the other parties,\u201d Amedisys indicated in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAmedisys provides home health, hospice and palliative care, among other services to more than 465,000 patients annually across 38 states and Washington D.C. The potential divestiture of some of its home health and hospice assets could help facilitate the completion of its sale to Optum by the end of 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUNH had abandoned VitalCaring as a divestiture buyer after the Delaware Chancery decision against VitalCaring\u2019s executives,\u201d Brian Tanquilut, an equity analyst at Jefferies, stated in a note shared with Hospice News. \u201cWe believe that there are other potential buyers for the AMED/UNH divestiture assets, including some strategic acquirers that had previously put in bids for the previous set of agencies that the companies tried to divest.\u201d\n\nHowever, the transaction faces other hurdles.\n\nThe divestiture announcement marks the latest iteration of the Amedisys acquisition, which Optum announced in June 2023. Last summer, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) began investigating potential antitrust concerns related to the deal. The DOJ in November filed an antitrust lawsuit, citing multi-faceted concerns that included potentially adverse impacts on competition as well as on home-based care workers and payers.\n\nThe companies noted that the assets in the VitalCaring divestiture package will \u201clikely change\u201d following a review of the DOJ\u2019s Complaint, the Jefferies analysts indicated. A new buyer of the assets included in the sale must be identified by March 31, 2025, they stated.\n\nThe DOJ performed a similar investigation \u2014 and filed a lawsuit \u2014 when Optum acquired the health care technology company Change Healthcare. A federal court eventually allowed that deal to proceed.\n\nAmedisys and UnitedHealth recently entered a new waiver agreement to extend the transaction\u2019s completion deadline until 10 days after a final court decision is issued in the DOJ antitrust lawsuit, or by Dec. 31, 2025, whichever comes first. The deal was previously anticipated to close at the end of 2024.\n\nThe companies are also proposing a trial start date of Aug. 18, 2025 in advance of the DOJ\u2019s proposed date of Oct. 27, 2025, according to the Jefferies analysts.\n\nAmedisys had no comment in response to Home Health Care News\u2019 inquiries.",

Those same ads described Chesapeake\u2019s agents as being \u201cimpartial,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d and \u201cunbiased,\u201d though in reality they sought only to sell Chesapeake supplemental health insurance.

The Superior Court found all three defendants liable in April 2022.\n\nThe court issued its findings and ruling on Dec. 31, 2024 following a trial on remedies.\n\n\u201cThe Court found that the defendants engaged in widespread misrepresentations of supplemental health insurance that they sold in Massachusetts, including intentionally engaging in bundling of major medical and supplemental insurance to deceive consumers into unknowingly buying supplemental polices,\u201d the AG\u2019s office said in its release.\n\nUnitedHealthcare plans to appeal the decision, according to a spokesperson for the company.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the Massachusetts court\u2019s latest ruling in the litigation involving the HealthMarkets companies,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement to Boston.com. \u201cThe fundamental errors in this ruling compound those already made by the trial court earlier in this case and have resulted in a decision that is clearly unsupported by the evidence and contrary to established Massachusetts law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nUnitedHealthcare didn\u2019t acquire the three companies until 2019, meaning they were utilizing these deceptive practices prior to UnitedHealthcare\u2019s involvement.\n\nOf the $165 million the Court ordered the companies to pay, $50 million will cover paying back the consumers who had paid for those policies.

            "content": "People are shocked at the murder of the United Healthcare CEO and those who support the actions of the murderer. They rightfully denounce the murderer and those who support him. However, no one has identified the fundamental reason why many people think the murder is justified.\n\nThe problem is the belief that health care is a right. If health care is a right, then we\u2019re morally obligated to provide health care to people. And if one is denied health care by an insurance company, this is an injustice and morally wrong.\n\nThe solution to this alleged injustice requires some kind of punishment. And given that people believe\u2014however mistakenly\u2014that this is such an important right, some obviously think that murder is appropriate.\n\nBut health care is not a right. A right, as shown so eloquently by Ayn Rand, is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a person\u2019s freedom of action in a social context. Rights define and protect our freedom. Freedom refers to the absence of the initiation of physical force, the absence of compulsion and coercion.\n\nIf health care is a right, it means forcing doctors and nurses to provide the health care or taxpayers to pay for it. This violates the rights and freedom of these individuals.\n\nEach of us has a right to his or her own life and no one has the right to force people to provide things that other people want or need. Rights and freedom are necessary because of the nature of human beings: we need freedom to use our basic tool of survival\u2014our reason\u2014to think and act to further our own lives and happiness. If we don\u2019t have our freedom protected, we\u2019re basically enslaved to those who are able to force us to provide what they want or need.\n\nPeople are frustrated with health insurance companies. I can empathize because I have had claims denied by my own insurance company. But insurance companies are engaging in voluntary trade. They are respecting the rights of others. If one doesn\u2019t like the actions an insurance company takes, one is free to argue with the company to get it to approve the claim, advocate for changes to its policies, sue the company if it isn\u2019t following its policies, or do business with another company.\n\nWhat we need to have better and less expensive health care is for rights to be protected more in this industry. It\u2019s violations of rights that have led to the current situation. For example, it was maximum wage controls during World War II that led to the rise of employer provided health care. Employers began providing other benefits since they couldn\u2019t pay wages above the government imposed maximum wage. Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare violate rights as well. These and other violations of rights have led to an insatiable demand for health care and made it harder to provide health care, all the while leading to rapidly rising prices.\n\nIf these violations of rights were abolished, the profit motive would provide the strongest possible motivation and ability to provide more and better health care. The cosmetic surgery industry provides a great example of what could be achieved. In this industry, which has far less government interference, quality has improved and prices have fallen in real terms to the point where people can afford such procedures on a much wider scale.\n\nInstead, people call for greater violations of rights in health care. But government provided health care, such as in Canada and Britain, is of lower quality and one faces far longer wait times to obtain it. Health care in these countries would be even worse if they didn\u2019t benefit from innovations in the freest health care market: the U.S.\n\nRelated Articles Commentary | California\u2019s roads and bridges worsen, ranking next to last in the nation in condition and cost-effectiveness.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s roads and bridges worsen, ranking next to last in the nation in condition and cost-effectiveness.

They would do so through voluntary charity. If one wants to help the poor, one has every right to do so. However, no one has the right to force others to help the poor obtain health care.\n\nThe solution to the problems in health care isn\u2019t violating rights to a greater degree through socializing medicine or acts of violence. The solution is greater protection of individual rights and freedom. This, ultimately, is the only way to create a more peaceful and prosperous society for everyone.\n\nBrian P.

A Facebook post by the company expressing sadness over his death received 77,000 laughing emojis, signalling widespread anger and a sense of justice among many. For many, Thompson\u2019s death represented retribution for the harm caused by the healthcare insurance industry, with his passing evoking feelings of excitement or even celebration.\n\nThe second reason is Mangione\u2019s remarkable ability to elude capture for five days after killing Thompson in broad daylight in Manhattan, fuelling the perception of him as a modern-day hero. His escape and the widespread support for him underscore the deep frustration many Americans feel toward the wealthy, especially within the context of the healthcare system. Mangione\u2019s actions, though violent, were seen by many as a stand against the \u201c1%,\u201d with his status as an anti-establishment figure growing despite his alleged crime.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the murder of Brian Thompson was seen by many as justice, considering the struggles that many have with health insurance in the US. One critic puts it well:\n\n\u201cLuigi\u2019s alleged assassination \u2013 horrifying as it is in isolation \u2013 becomes intelligible as a desperate assertion of agency in a system designed to neutralize it. In such an environment, the moral calculus shifts: what options remain for those who lack wealth, power, or institutional support? The answer, for many, is despair \u2013 despair that, over time, metastasizes into rage.\u201d (\u201cLuigi Mangione: An Icon of Rage\u201d, omarnajjarine.substack.com, 24 December 2024)\n\nThe health insurance industry has long been criticised for prioritising profit over providing quality, affordable healthcare to people. Almost every US adult has had issues with health insurance claims. One in five had a claim denied in the past year. This is twice the rate of those who were on Medicare or Medicaid. (\u201cKilling of UnitedHealthcare CEO prompts flurry of stories on social media over denied insurance claims\u201d, edition.cnn.com, 6 December 2024)\n\nUnitedHealthcare was also the target of a class action lawsuit in Minnesota last year alleging that the company used AI when processing claims to streamline the process and save money. The suit claims this led to claims, especially of elderly patients, being wrongfully denied. Companies use prior authorisation to decide if claims are medically necessary or backed by scientific evidence, which is also conducive to their bottom line. (\u201cUnitedHealthcare lawsuit: Physicians allege delay, deny, underpay practices\u201d, www.fox9.com, 12 December 2024)\n\nBut does that justify the murder?\n\nIslamic teachings on vigilante justice\n\nIslam places a high emphasis on absolute justice. The Holy Quran says, \u201cVerily, Allah commands you to make over the trusts to those entitled to them, and that, when you judge between men, you judge with justice.\u201d (Surah an-Nisa\u2019, Ch.4: V.59)\n\nHowever, the Holy Quran also places an extremely high value on human life. It prescribes that whoever kills one life, \u201cit shall be as if he had killed all mankind.\u201d (Surah al-Maidah, Ch.5: V.33)\n\nWhile Islam does place a preference on forgiveness over retribution, it still allows for punishment to occur. However, it is important to recognise who is responsible for administering justice.\n\nThe Holy Quran says, \u201cAnd the recompense of an injury is the like thereof; but whoso forgives and [his act] brings about reformation, his reward is with Allah. Surely, He loves not the wrongdoers. But there is no blame on those who defend themselves after they have been wronged. The blame is only on those who wrong men and transgress on the earth without justification. Such will have a grievous punishment.\u201d (Surah ash-Shura, Ch.42: V.41-43)\n\nThese verses also touch on one of the problems at the heart of the murder: vigilante justice. Brian Thompson is considered to fall in the second category of men, i.e., those who wrong others without justification. He and his company made millions by profiting from the pain and suffering of others.\n\nHowever, the verse says that these men will have their punishment with Allah, not with their victims. This rejection of vigilante justice is also seen in the Charter of Medina. Whenever there were disputes, they would be resolved in the legal system or by the Holy Prophetsa himself, never by individuals or vigilantes. (\u201cA Good Vigilante?\u201d, www.youtube.com, 12 December 2024)\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is clear that while Islam places a heavy emphasis on justice, it rejects the notion of vigilante justice. Justice should be carried out by Allah or by the existing legal systems, not by individuals. While Brian Thompson may have committed injustice and profited off suffering, a vigilante should not have delivered his punishment.\n\nAnd although it shouldn\u2019t have reached this point, this situation can serve as a wake-up call for society; human lives should not be left at the mercy of insurance companies. It should also prompt legal authorities to explore ways to safeguard the sanctity of life and regulate the structure of health insurance companies more effectively.",

The killing shocked the business community and galvanized some health insurance critics. Mangione posted frequently online about his struggles with back pain, though he was never a UnitedHealthcare client.\n\nFederal charges against Mangione include murder and firearms counts. He made an initial appearance on the charges late last month. He won't be required to enter a plea until an indictment is returned.\n\nMangione has pleaded not guilty in a New York state court to multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. His next appearance in state court is scheduled for February 21.\n\nThe maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Mangione was arrested December 9 in a Pennsylvania McDonald\u00b4s following a five-day search. He's being held in a Brooklyn federal jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.",

The patient is in ICU with a brain hemorrhage, in a coma, on a ventilator and in heart failure, the doctor said.\"...because I haven't proven to them that caring for her in the hospital was \"medically necessary\".Tear it all down,\" the doctor wrote.The post comes as UnitedHealthcare is the target of public outrage because of its high denial of claims. Its 50-year-old CEO Brian Thompson was killed on December 4 in New York by accused Luigi Mangione, who was hailed as a hero by the disgruntled customers of the insurance company. 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was never a customer of UnitedHealthcare but he chose Thompson as his company deemed fit for his target. Mangione's target was insurance -- though he pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.Dr Zachary also posted the letter that he submitted to the company explaining the medical necessity of his patient.\"I am writing on behalf of my patient, XXX, to document the medical necessity of being on a ventilator in the intensive care unit for the treatment of their brain hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and respiratory failure. Their treatment was medically necessary to prevent them from dying during this visit,\" the letter said.As the port went viral, many users reacted with their experience with UHC . \"While I was going through stage 3 cervical cancer in 2016 I was denied by @UHC. The reason? They said the result of my diagnosis was due to an accident. I called in and asked how I could have accidentally caught cancer? The agent explained that they had a third party company that did their initial reviews that deny everything on their first review and apologized for the mistake,\" one user said.Many users also took the side of the UHC on this specific incident that the doctor cited and said that insurance companies only pay for treatment. Another said that the incident probably did not even happen and even if it happened, it was probably a bureaucratic error but this should not have kept the patient from getting the care they needed, one said.\"I know it's not the doctors arena really, but if prices at hospitals weren't so outrageous, maybe more claims would get approved. System is broken on so many levels,\" one wrote.Recently, an ex-employee of UnitedHealthcare claimed that they were trained on various ways to deny claims while there was no training to clear claims.UnitedHealthcare previously stated that it approves and processes approximately 90 per cent of medical claims upon submission, dismissing social media allegations of claim denials as highly inaccurate and misleading. The company was also previously implicated in a lawsuit, where it faced accusations of using an AI tool reportedly responsible for a 90% error rate.",

These structural barriers underscore the urgent need for community leaders like Karst and Gaumer to champion change.\n\n\u201cKathy Karst, Dr. Kathy Gaumer, and all of our nominees' steadfast efforts are helping to ensure everyone across the Kansas City area has equitable opportunities for a longer, healthier life,\u201d said Laura Lopez, Executive Director of the American Heart Association. \u201cBy ensuring access to quality healthcare and addressing health disparities, we are strengthening our collective future, creating a healthier, more vibrant community for generations to come.\u201d\n\nHeart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and projections show its economic toll will nearly triple by 2050. However, Leaders of Impact nominees like Karst and Gaumer are advancing awareness and action to fight these trends.\n\nOver seven weeks, Karst and Gaumer competed in a fundraising campaign alongside 7 other Kansas City professionals. \u201cTeam Kathy\u201d was named the 2024 Leaders of Impact winners after raising significant funds and engaging their networks to amplify the mission of the American Heart Association.\n\n\u201cTaking part in Leaders of Impact was personal for me because heart disease has deeply impacted my family,\u201d said Karst. \u201cFrom my maternal grandmother\u2019s pioneering heart valve replacement to my in-laws\u2019 battles with stroke and open-heart surgery, I\u2019ve seen firsthand the difference that hope, determination, and support can make.

Participating in this campaign has been an honor and a privilege, and having a close friend as a partner made it even more meaningful.\u201d\n\nFor more than 100 years, the American Heart Association has driven change by removing barriers to health, investing in groundbreaking research, educating healthcare professionals and patients, and advocating for healthy policies.

            "content": "Call him a hero or villain, but the man who killed the United Healthcare CEO struck a nerve, exposing a deep rage shared by many Americans across the political spectrum \u2014 an anger at an industry that earns obscene profits from the suffering of others. His chilling act shifted the national conversation from immigration to corporate greed. Finally.\n\nFor too long, Americans have hesitated to criticize the super-rich. Chalk it up to our tribalist nature that has so many convinced that our financial struggles are caused not by wealth hoarding but by those we view as outside our clan.\n\nHistory offers many examples. In Nazi Germany, Jews were blamed for a financial depression triggered by the American stock market crash. My parents and grandmother barely escaped; many in my family did not. Decades later, Ronald Reagan handed the wealthy the largest tax cuts in U.S. history while vilifying the \u201cWelfare Queen\u201d who leached from the feeding trough of \u201cBig Government.\u201d This racist caricature was meant to distract from policies that began a 40-year transfer of wealth from the 90% to the 1%, producing the largest wealth gap in a century. It\u2019s a story about the undeserving poor vs. the deserving rich.\n\nToday, we face a similar narrative. Immigrants are blamed both for stealing jobs and freeloading despite their essential role in propping up our economy given our shrinking workforce. After being fed a steady anti-immigration news media diet, it\u2019s not surprising that nearly four out of five Republicans support placing undocumented immigrants in internment camps.\n\nThe greater the wealth imbalance, the more the wealthy need to distort the truth. They peddle the long-discredited Trickle-Down theory, claiming that what benefits them benefits us all. But rising tides don\u2019t lift all boats when some people have no boat at all, or when their boats are sinking because the super yachts are creating destructive waves.\n\nWe have to stop believing that billionaires have working people\u2019s interests at heart. In fact, they\u2019re mutually exclusive. A gangbuster stock market depends on keeping wages low and unions banished. Outsized campaign contributions ensure that taxes are slashed and regulations meant to keep us healthy, safe, and not impoverished are gutted. It makes complete sense that the wealth lobby exploits fears of \u201csocialism\u201d to keep people voting against their own interests. It\u2019s no coincidence the U.S. remains the only developed nation without universal health care. This is where our anger should be directed.\n\nBut redirecting anger is not easy. Six of the richest U.S. corporations control 90% of our media and their profits depend on algorithms and news coverage designed to keep us divided, misinformed, and distracted from this billionaire plunder. \u201cYou know the media has failed,\u201d says essayist Rebecca Solnit, \u201cwhen people are more concerned that a trans girl might play on a softball team than that the climate crisis will destroy our planet.\u201d\n\nDuring the next four years it will be critical to get people to see through this deception. When we start feeling the fallout from a second Trump term, the scapegoating will intensify. Tariffs, more tax cuts for the rich, and the loss of immigrant labor will send prices soaring and balloon the deficit. Many may lose health care, Social Security, and worker protections. The wealth lobby will no doubt point fingers elsewhere.\n\nChange is possible though. As a grant writer for 30 years, I\u2019ve seen campaigns shift public opinion on issues like marriage equality, net neutrality, and climate change. Recently, several states won historic economic reforms after decades of trying. In Massachusetts, RiseUpMass won the nation\u2019s sixth millionaire\u2019s tax by debunking claims it would harm retirees. In Washington state, the Balance Our Tax Code, a coalition of over 80 diverse groups, from home health aide workers to members of the Yakima Nation, was able pass a capital gains tax, calling out Amazon and Microsoft for avoiding their share of taxes. \u201cThe biggest lesson we learned,\u201d said campaign communications manager Reiny Cohen \u201cwas that when we come together and tell the same story, lawmakers have no choice but to listen.\u201d\n\nIn other words, changing minds requires a coordinated echo chamber. The #MeToo movement showed how the right framing, amplified through the news media, can shift perspectives and galvanize action. Imagine if we could help more people connect the dots between stagnant wages, failing schools, a burning planet, unaffordable housing, and the greed of the 1%.\n\nBut the message must go beyond bashing billionaires. It must present a compelling vision of what is possible if we stand up against the ultra rich. The We Make Minnesota coalition was able to pass a tax increase on the wealthiest 1% by countering anti-Somalian rhetoric with a \u201cWe\u2019re Better Off Together\u201d message. Instead of using a \u201cStop the Cuts\u201d framework, the campaign emphasized the subsidized health care, free preschool, and tuition-free college programs the state is now able to offer.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about destroying capitalism. A healthy balance between a free market and protective government is essential. But when the richest among us prioritize profit over the well-being of the majority, it\u2019s no longer about politics \u2014 it\u2019s about survival.\n\nThe murder of the United Healthcare CEO, as horrendous as it was, forced us to confront the injustices we\u2019ve been taught to tolerate. This moment must unite us against the true enemies of the American dream: unchecked greed and exploitation of the many for the benefit of the few. We can either remain manipulated by scapegoating and fear or see the truth and demand change. Only then can we build a society where no one feels driven to such desperate measures again.\n\nSarena Neyman is a writer who lives in Leverett.",

            "content": "Since the fatal shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, polarised discussions about the US health insurance system have not abated, with thousands of Americans continuing to share their struggles in having their healthcare covered.\n\nHundreds of people from across the US shared their frustrations with the Guardian, too, explaining how their lives had been shaped by their experiences of trying to access healthcare in the US.\n\nWhile many reported that their health coverage had worsened in recent years, particularly in 2024, Elizabeth, a 64-year-old retiree from Maryland, already experienced the system\u2019s brutality more than 20 years ago, when she lived in California and was involved in a serious car accident during a business trip to another state in 2002.\n\n\u201cI was treated at a trauma hospital for three days,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy insurer denied coverage because the care had not been pre-approved, and because the accident was not in California. It was insane.\u201d\n\nOnly repeated calls by her employer\u2019s head of HR persuaded her insurer to eventually partly cover her treatment, she said. \u201cI was very, very lucky,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cHealth insurance in the US is a constant battle. You\u2019re always trying to get stuff covered, you\u2019re always told that things are being denied.\u201d\n\nThe same insurance company later denied coverage for a standard chemotherapy drug with which her oncologist wanted to treat her stage 3 breast cancer, she said.\n\nI was very sick for two years, but I had to keep working Elizabeth from Maryland\n\n\u201cMy doctor persuaded the drug representative to donate the medication,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cI was very sick for two years, but I had to keep working. My husband had just been laid off and I had health insurance.\u201d\n\nAfter adding her husband to her policy, Elizabeth\u2019s insurance cost more than doubled, while the chemo made her so nauseous that she threw up in coffee cups and in her car after work, she recalled. \u201cIt was very hard. After surviving cancer, I decided I had to find a job with a university because they would have to provide health insurance, whereas a small business or non-profit might not.\u201d\n\nShe took two master\u2019s degrees off her CV to get hired for a university job she was overqualified for, accepting a hefty career downgrade as well as a substantial pay cut she never made up again. \u201cI know a lot of people who have wrecked their careers in this way \u2013 just to get health insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople from all states, ages and backgrounds shared how coverage for prescribed, often critical treatments had been denied, or only been approved after lengthy delays and months or years of arguing with the insurer, and often only with the help of legal counsel.\n\nScores of people reported that their insurer had sent them automated rejections, ignored correspondence for months, or changed the rules for coverage arbitrarily and frequently, moves they perceived as efforts to evade paying out for claims.\n\n\u201cThe exploitation of our system has been so consistent and universal that most of us have long ago settled into a kind of learned helplessness,\u201d said Liz, 43, a physician from Minnesota.\n\n\u201cI work in healthcare and have \u2018good\u2019 insurance \u2013 we pay $10,000 per year in premiums. We barely use it, so it\u2019s been a pretty good deal for my insurance company. Still, they didn\u2019t hesitate to charge me $600 extra when my son broke his arm last month.\u201d\n\nThe system is built to wear us down until we give up Liz from Minnesota\n\nSeven years ago, Liz\u2019s husband was denied a cervical spine decompression surgery because he was not in pain, she recalled. \u201cI appealed twice through the standard appeal process and was denied twice more. Eventually, I got the surgery approved after calling and crying on the phone. A humiliating process, clearly built to wear us down until we give up, while we and our loved ones suffer.\u201d\n\nAlthough some people felt their healthcare was decent, usually thanks to generous workplace health insurance, the vast majority of respondents said getting coverage and accessing treatment was perpetually difficult.\n\nDozens of people said they had had to foot costly medical bills despite having insurance, among them Stephanie Maughan, 68, from Boston, who said she had been saddled with thousands in debt after her insurer denied covering medical costs of about $20,000 last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare,\u201d Maughan said. \u201cI broke my finger and needed some occupational therapy. My husband needed hearing aids. It was all \u2018that\u2019s not covered\u2019, \u2018you\u2019re out of network\u2019 and \u2018you have to meet your $2,500 deductible\u2019. It adds up, we had to take out a loan. We\u2019re not poor, but as far as I\u2019m concerned we have no health insurance, despite paying about $400 a month for a premium policy. It didn\u2019t used to be like this. This country is in big trouble.\u201d\n\nScores of respondents who have been navigating the US healthcare system for many years felt that corporate greed had progressively made the system less accessible, less safe, more exhausting due to mounting bureaucratic hurdles and more expensive over the past few decades.\n\n\u201cMore and more hospitals are run by corporations today,\u201d said 64-year-old Thesia, from Houston. \u201cThere was profit before, now they want bigger profits, continual growth. It\u2019s a bit like the story about the frog in the water, and someone slowly bringing up the temperature while the frog doesn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nNearly a quarter of US hospitals are now run by for-profit entities, and by 2021, 5,779 physician practices were owned by private equity, up from 816 in 2012.\n\nThesia, who enjoys a high-end insurance policy his employer heavily subsidizes, feels he is getting \u201ca good deal\u201d by paying about $5,000 annually for a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan covering himself and his wife, given the standard of care they have been receiving while being able to freely choose their doctor.\n\n\u201cFor that, the insurance pays 80% and I have to come up with the other 20%,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year we paid between $6,000 and $8,000 out of pocket, and I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\nSome years ago, however, when his wife was really sick, she was refused coverage for an MRI, based on the recommendation of a doctor working for the insurer. \u201cI found out who the doctor was. Not only was he not a specialist, he was not licensed to practice medicine in our state. I reported this to the insurer. They didn\u2019t respond, they just approved the MRI,\u201d Thesia recalled, an experience that chimed with that of many other respondents.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, Thesia felt, had improved health insurance access for some groups of people, particularly those with pre-existing medical conditions. Others noted the landmark reforms did not go far enough, complaining about the high cost of Obamacare plans, the need for referrals by a primary care physician and the overwhelming complexity of the medical billing system.\n\n\u201cEven after the ACA, health coverage is still difficult,\u201d said a 59-year-old data scientist from New Hampshire. \u201cI\u2019ve had to change from my longtime doctor because that office stopped taking any ACA plans. But even now that I have a non-ACA plan through my employer, I\u2019ve had to change prescriptions because insurers choose what they cover. A visit to the emergency room costs over $1,000 and I avoid getting any extra medical tests because they\u2019re not always covered.\u201d\n\nFor-profit healthcare providers, he felt, were always trying to find additional ways to increase billing and reduce coverage, for instance by having out-of-network specialist providers within hospitals that are in-network.\n\nEvery time I\u2019ve used my health insurance, I was met with a surprise bill months later Marcus from Texas\n\n\u201cEvery single time I have used my health insurance other than for an annual checkup I\u2019ve paid my portion and then they decided they were covering less and I was met with a surprise bill months later,\u201d said Marcus, from Texas, who was among many who complained about hidden costs and unexpected bills surfacing long after they accessed healthcare, ranging from teeth cleanings to pre-approved surgeries.\n\nMany reported that they struggled finding a doctor after their previous one had dropped out of their insurer\u2019s network due to untenable new terms imposed on them by the insurer, with various people saying their insurer had asked them to travel for an hour or longer to see a doctor they would cover.\n\nSeveral people said they had been unable to find a doctor who was accepting new patients, and many said unexpected costs now made them avoid seeking medical help.\n\nMarta, a 31-year-old from North Carolina, was among a number of people who critically compared the US system with their experience of healthcare and insurance abroad.\n\n\u201cIn Germany we were paying way more as a family for insurance, because of our high income,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, as a relatively healthy family, we actually end up paying less, even with each visit costing about $200.\u201d\n\nLike others, Marta conceded that waiting times to see a doctor in other countries \u2013 the UK, Germany and Poland in her case \u2013 were usually significantly longer than in the US.\n\nLisa Markey, a Briton living in New York, described her experience of using the UK\u2019s NHS recently as \u201ca disaster\u201d. In the UK, she said, she could not access treatment for her retinopathy and nearly lost her eyesight as a result. It was fixed swiftly, she said, upon her return to the US, where she experienced \u201cextraordinary coverage\u201d while she had corporate insurance through her employer.\n\nThe lack of upfront pricing information in the US, however, compared unfavourably with experiences of healthcare abroad. \u201cThe first time I went to a doctor here, I thought, \u2018Great, I only pay my copay,\u2019\u201d Marta said. \u201cTwo months later I got a bill for $400. It\u2019s a gamble. I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019re well off enough not to have to worry about the cost when going to a doctor, but if I was earning less, I\u2019d think five times before getting medical help.\u201d\n\nHow much profit is enough? Seth Polansky from Washington DC\n\nSeth Polansky, 52, a solicitor from Washington DC who has a take-home annual salary of about $80,000 and currently pays approximately $800 monthly for his health plan, said he had been with his insurer, one of the largest in the country and considered to be one of the cheapest, for years.\n\n\u201cThey get worse every year,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil 2018, I\u2019d been on the same dosage of my medication for two decades. Then they decided I could only have two pills a day instead of three \u2013 no matter what my doctor argued. This year, they completely removed my medication from coverage.\u201d\n\nTwo of his long-term doctors, Polansky said, had recently moved out of his insurer\u2019s network, because the insurer had changed its contract terms. \u201cI already have to pay deductible fees of $8,000 per year on top of my premiums just to be able to use my insurance, but I went out of pocket to see my old doctor who knows me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably going to delay my retirement because of these expenses. Last year, [UnitedHealth Group] had over $20bn in profits. How much is enough?\u201d",

            "content": "Typically, a shooting in the United States would not significantly disrupt the news cycle. However, the assassination of one of the CEOs of UnitedHealth earlier this month has attracted relentless media upheaval. Much of the coverage has centred on Luigi Mangione, the alleged assailant, who reportedly harboured deep frustrations with the healthcare system following a spinal injury, and inability to get the proper healthcare in time. Beneath the sensational headlines, however, lies an opportunity for policymakers, to ignite a critical conversation about the urgent need for healthcare reform in America.\n\nPublic frustration with health insurers has manifested through Mangione\u2019s case, with his alleged crime symbolising the final pressure point on a system already straining under decades of growing tension. This frustration is seemingly held back by an intentionally manufactured and widespread lack of healthcare literacy, fuelled by the complex, deeply rooted structures and excessive paperwork that define the healthcare insurance system.\n\nThese policies have denied critical treatments, driven families into financial ruin over uncovered medical expenses, and left entire communities underserved. The call for reform is growing louder, as many see health insurance not as a solution but as a bureaucratic obstacle\u2014an imposing barrier rather than a lifeline.\n\nWhile Mangione\u2019s alleged actions cannot address the systemic flaws of a commodified healthcare system, the incident has the potential to spark a much-needed national dialogue. The critical question remains: Is the current role of insurance companies in American healthcare truly indispensable?\n\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance originated during World War II when wage controls incentivised employers to offer tax-exempt benefits. Post-war expansion solidified this system, with unions advocating for healthcare benefits. Although Medicare and Medicaid later addressed coverage gaps for the elderly and low-income populations, reliance on employer plans remains a salient part of the healthcare system for working Americans. What began as a practical solution has since evolved into a complex web that ties healthcare access to job stability, limiting choice and increasing dependency on employer-sponsored plans.\n\nLuigi Mangione\u2019s experiences then highlight the systemic flaws of the American healthcare system. Despite having employer-provided insurance, he faced significant bureaucratic obstacles, including claim denials and delays in accessing necessary care. These challenges not only worsenedhis condition, but also exposed a critical flaw in the system: possessing health insurance does not guarantee timely or affordable treatment.\n\nJournalist Ken Klippenstein was one of the few who published Mangione\u2019s full manifesto, where Mangione writes: \u201cA reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy.\u201d As of today, America, despite operating the world\u2019s most expensive healthcare system, ranks 48th in life expectancy\u2014a glaring disparity that disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations.\n\nMangione\u2019s struggles are not unique, they reflect the challenges faced by millions of Americans. The average annual cost of healthcare in the U.S. stands at a staggering $15,074 per person, a figure that leaves many having to navigate a fragmented and profit-driven system that often prioritises financial gain over patient well-being. Around 40% of U.S. adults report struggling with medical debt (KFF, 2022), and a 2009 Harvard study linked 45,000 deaths annually to a lack of health coverage.\n\nUnitedHealth Group further underlines the systemic issues within the healthcare insurance industry. In 2023, the company reported $371.6 billion in revenue, reflecting its ever-rising growth even as actual healthcare continues to decline. Notably, UnitedHealth carries the highest claim denial rate in the U.S., rejecting 32% of claims compared to the industry average of 16%. The company has also faced lawsuits for using algorithms to limit mental health coverage\u2014a practice declared illegal in some states, but largely enabled by fragmented regulatory oversight.\n\nThe concentrated power of health insurers signifies these issues. According to the American Medical Association (2024), a single insurer dominates more than 50% of the market in 43% of metropolitan areas, which in turn fostersoligopolistic behaviour. This market dominance allows companies like UnitedHealth to keep a large portion of control over prices, limit competition, and prioritise profits over quality patient care.\n\nUnsurprisingly then, UnitedHealth\u2019s influence extends beyond the marketplace, and into policymaking. The company wields immense political and economic power through extensive lobbying and campaign contributions. This shapes regulations and Medicare reimbursement rates in its favour. By funding think tanks, advocacy groups, and bipartisan campaigns, UnitedHealth amplifies its sway over public opinion and policy, ensuring the system continues to prioritise corporate interests over those of patients. Thus, the assassination of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO underscores the profound inequities entrenched in the U.S. healthcare system. The commodification of care\u2014marked by soaring costs, denied claims, and insurer dominance\u2014continues to exacerbate disparities and burden vulnerable populations. This moment demands a critical national rethinking with healthcare reform. Policymakers must confront the unchecked power of insurance corporations, reimagine employer-sponsored plans, and prioritise equitable, accessible, and patient-centred care. The pressing question is whether this tragedy will spark meaningful change or be another moment lost to a profit-driven system.\n\nThe tragic events surrounding Luigi Mangione and the assassination of UnitedHealth\u2019s CEO have unveiled the deep-seated flaws in the American healthcare system. Beyond the sensational headlines lies a stark reality: a profit-driven model that prioritizes financial gain over patient welfare has left millions struggling. This moment presents a rare opportunity for policymakers to rise above entrenched corporate interests and initiate meaningful healthcare reform. The question is no longer whether change is necessary but whether society has the courage to confront the systemic inequities and prioritize a healthcare model that serves people, not profits. Will this tragedy serve as a turning point, or will it fade into yet another missed opportunity for reform? The answer lies in our collective will to act.\n\nSources:\n\nKFF (Kaiser Family Foundation) 2022, Health Care Debt Survey, KFF.\n\nhttps://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/kff-health-care-debt-survey/\n\nHarvard Gazette 2009, New study finds 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage, Harvard Gazette.\n\nhttps://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/\n\nUnitedHealth Group 2023, Q4 2023 financial results, UnitedHealth Group.\n\nhttps://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/content/dam/UHG/PDF/investors/2023/UNH-Q4-2023-Release.pdf\n\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA) 2024, 95% of US health insurance markets are highly concentrated, AMA.\n\nhttps://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/access-care/95-us-health-insurance-markets-are-highly-concentrated",

            "content": "In this issue, I\u2019m going to review the past year, talk about what anti-monopolists accomplished over the past four, and make some predictions for what\u2019s coming. Plus, I\u2019ll go over how BIG has done, readership numbers, most popular stories, and evaluate our specific projects. Let\u2019s start with a brief recap of the past year in anti-monopoly themes.\n\nWhat Happened in 2024?\n\nThe biggest event in 2024 was Donald Trump\u2019s election, chosen because voters were angry about the economy.\n\nWhat happened? In short, while antitrust enforcers under Biden did well, it\u2019s hard to think of many other parts of his government who did. I\u2019ve gone over this problem, but the gist of it is a mass failure to govern.\n\nFor instance, the Health and Human Services Department, with a budget of roughly two trillion dollars, did nothing to address giants like UnitedHealth Group and soaring health costs. The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development didn\u2019t touch the price of food or housing. And on and on. The agencies I track have about a half of a thousandth of a percent of the Federal budget, so they can\u2019t make up for what the rest of the government failed to do.\n\nThe second biggest event in the anti-monopoly world this year was the government\u2019s victory over Google, the first monopolization win by the DOJ in twenty five years and a landmark case akin to Standard Oil, AT&T, and Alcoa. We could soon be looking at a post-Google world.\n\nBeyond Trump\u2019s victory and the Google case, plenty happened. Slowly, the internet is being brought into our regulatory apparatus. TikTok is teetering, the Supreme Court is wrestling with tech giants as judges start rolling back Section 230, the DOJ sued Apple, and the FTC sought to apply the law to the subscription economy. Judges blocked fashion house and supermarket mergers. And anti-monopoly arguments and suits extended to housing, the medical system, and payments.\n\nNow let\u2019s step back, and look at the broad record of the last four years.\n\nThe Legal Record\n\nThis headline does a nice job of encapsulating how the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division have done.\n\nOne way to understand progress is to look at the big stuff, like the antitrust wins against Google, the first major monopolization victories in two decades. That\u2019s part of a revival of monopolization law, which was left for dead in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe level of litigation on pure monopolization cases is now historic. As Bloomberg noted, \u201cthe US government now has more pending cases targeting alleged monopolies than at any time since the trust-busting era of the early 1900s, shortly after the antitrust laws were first passed.\u201d That suit of cases includes government cases against Apple, Google, Ticketmaster, Visa, Amazon, RealPage, and Meta, among others. Private litigants are following along, bringing their own set of cases, such as those against health records giant Epic Systems, NASCAR, Amazon, and Google.\n\nAnd then there are the high-profile merger cases. From 2009-2014, the Department of Justice brought just two cases to trial, neither of which was worth more than $300 million. In just three years, Biden enforcers have litigated 14 mergers, most of which were multi-billion cases. The defendants were recognizable brands, like American Airlines, UnitedHealth Group, Meta, Microsoft, Versace, JetBlue, Booz Allen, Penguin RandomHouse, Kroger, and Albertsons, with seven wins, four losses, one settlement, one case on appeal, and two trials upcoming.\n\nOne critique, of course, is that the new administration can simply reverse enforcement priorities. So how durable is this record? The answer is, more than you might think. The courts have accepted most of the arguments that the new enforcers put forward. Just a few weeks ago, for instance, three Trump-appointed judges on the Ninth Circuit cited the 2023 merger guidelines favorably, the tenth time courts have done so. That\u2019s probably the fastest we\u2019ve ever seen courts accept new merger guidelines.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not counting the significant changes in privacy consumer rights, airline rules, ocean shipping, private equity, markets in medical devices like inhalers and hearing aids, hotel and ticketing junk fees and bank overdraft fees, and medical debt, many of which are likely to endure.\n\nDid any of it matter to the real economy? Yes. Trillions of dollars of mergers haven\u2019t happened, which means that large businesses have had to find ways to conduct themselves by investing in the economy. And that has a big impact, though it\u2019s not one you\u2019d hear about, both because the White House refused to talk about it, and because big business leaders would prefer to not laud restrictions that forced them to do a better job.\n\nFor example, in 2022, Lina Khan blocked the $40 billion merger of chip firms Nvidia and Arm, causing both firms to focus on their core businesses. Since then, both companies are doing well. Arm went public and is now selling at a rich premium. Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s stock is up more than 500%, and as the central node in producing artificial intelligence chips, has become the most valuable company in the world. Would the situation have played out as positively if they had focused on turf fights and merging instead of executing? Doubtful. Would anyone on CNBC observe that Nvidia\u2019s remarkable run is in part due to a government restriction? No.\n\nSimilarly, air travel was nightmarish in 2022. After a $150 million record fine on Southwest and investigations by the Department of Transportation of other airlines, the industry cleaned up its act. There\u2019s now record travel and it\u2019s fairly smooth, though airlines will of course not admit it\u2019s because they are no longer able to schedule flight commitments they know they can\u2019t meet.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more, of course. At his goodbye speech a few weeks ago, Antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter left this document of his division\u2019s accomplishments. You can see the cross-cutting work to influence the rest of the government and restructure capital markets.\n\nThe End of the Green Lantern Theory of Politics\n\nThe legal and policy changes matter. But in my view, the bigger accomplishment is to reestablish the idea that we can actually touch the economy using democracy. Throughout the Obama era, neoliberals mocked the idea that public officials have any power, arguing that citizens demanding their government act were prone to what they called the \u201cGreen Lantern Theory\u201d of the Presidency, after a comic book character who could simply do whatever he chose with a magic ring. Anyone who expected anything from their government was foolish and naive. That\u2019s just not how it works, you get bailouts for banks and nothing else.\n\nThis rationale worked, largely because we had never seen anything else. But now we have, mostly due to Donald Trump, but on the Democratic side, because of these antitrust enforcers and regulators. Never again will people accept a government as incapable of acting. I don\u2019t think we can overstate how important such a change really is. As the Democratic Party deliberates and engages in recriminations, and the Republican Party governs, both will operate according to the new expectations that voters have. And some of those expectations have been set by anti-monopolists. Our people, in office, ignored the wishes of the CEOs of trillion dollar firms, by using the law.\n\nA few weeks ago, for instance, thousands of people took to Twitter, heartily thanking the Federal Trade Commission for their refunds from Epic Games, which had unfairly pilfered hundreds of millions from gamers. That sounds small, but it is one of many actions that helped restore democratic expectations. Senator Bernie Sanders talked up cheap inhalers at events, the UFCW and dozens of politicians attacked the Kroger-Albertsons merger, and Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien, whose union refused to endorse Kamala Harris, routinely lauded Lina Khan.\n\nAnd at least some of it will continue into the next administration, which is the ultimate test of how to create durable change. For example, here\u2019s Donald Trump Jr. blasting pharmacy benefit managers, the goliaths that Lina Khan targeted for years.\n\nOk, so that\u2019s that. What about this newsletter? As usual, I\u2019m stunned at how great this community is.\n\nBIG Stats\n\nBIG is much bigger than it was last year. This year our humble newsletter passed over 133,998 subscribers, up 29% from 104,024 at the end of 2023, 76,647 at the end of 2022, 50,080 at the end of 2021, 35,513 at the end of 2020 and 17,690 at the end of 2019. So thank you for forwarding this newsletter to your friends and contacts!\n\nOn average, each issue in 2023 had 102.7k views, up from 93.3k in 2023 and 67.7k in 2022. Over a hundred thousand readers for each article means we\u2019re reaching a wide swath of people involved in this area, becoming one of the most important outlets on antitrust and monopoly. A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with an antitrust lawyer in the government who told me that our work helps him understand what the rest of the division is doing. And some ideas we covered, like breaking up big medicine, have started to turn into legislation.\n\nBeyond just subscribing, 4,281 of you have signed up as paying supporters of BIG, up from 3,554 paid subscribers at the end of 2023 and up from 3,016 paid subscribers at the end of 2022. That\u2019s a growth rate of 20%. The growth in paid subscribers is lower than the growth of overall subscribers. That\u2019s because I don\u2019t tend to put up a paywall. The goal of BIG is to make a difference not a buck, so I mostly rely on your goodwill for the financing. That said, if you\u2019ve been meaning to do so but haven\u2019t gotten around to it, please join as a paying subscriber.\n\nOk, so for paying subscribers, here\u2019s what we did with your investment. Dave Dayen and I launched a podcast called Organized Money, where we interview business leaders and policymakers trying to deal with consolidated markets. And BIG continued our Big Tech on Trial coverage of the Google antitrust trials, hiring writer Tom Blakely to go into a Virginia district court and chronicle the Google antitrust trial on a daily basis. That decision will come down any day now. Next year, we\u2019ve got some interesting potential projects lined up.\n\nPredictions for 2025\n\nLast year\u2019s predictions were pretty good. I was right that Google would lose its antitrust case on search, and that the Epic Games remedy would be meaningful but not enough. The CFPB did do an open banking rule, and the DOJ did file cases against Apple, Ticketmaster, Visa, UnitedHealth Group and RealPage, though not Exxon. The FTC filed against PBMs, and a Robinson-Patman Act case on price discrimination. State level campaigns on junk fees, right-to-repair, hospital consolidation, and non-competes did pick up steam. Kroger-Albertsons lost their case, the FTC had its noncompete rule blocked by the courts. And Congress did kneecap enforcer budgets.\n\nI got some things wrong. I predicted Hollywood would begin to consolidate, which it hasn\u2019t yet. The Ninth Circuit still hasn\u2019t ruled on the Microsoft-Activision appeal. Most surprisingly, the momentum to do something about app stores kind of died out a bit.\n\nOk, so what\u2019s going to happen this year?\n\nTrump will find a way to nullify the TikTok law.\n\nGoogle will lose its adtech antitrust case against the Federal government and the states. The Texas case will go to trial. Trump will personally intervene to cut a deal to prevent Google from being broken up. State attorneys general will split from the Federal enforcers on remedies.\n\nCongress will try to roll back antitrust enforcement and strip the Federal Trade Commission of antitrust authority, but will fall short.\n\nThere will be a merger boom in the media, defense, bank, airline and tech sectors, as dealmakers seek to take advantage of a more lax environment. The Federal Trade Commission will become mostly paralyzed and embroiled in culture warring but will challenge a few obviously unlawful mergers.\n\nThe FTC will seek to drop or settle most consumer protection claims, and settle the Amazon antitrust suit for pennies on the dollar. The Antitrust Division will keep most of the antitrust suits from the Biden world going, though it will be under pressure to drop the Apple case.\n\nThe campaign to break up big medicine will pick up steam. The Trump administration and Congress will launch an attack on pharmacy benefit managers, which will result in a major reform of pharmaceutical pricing. Drug wholesalers will begin to see scrutiny.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit will overturn Microsoft\u2019s district court win for the Activision acquisition.\n\nPrivate equity and crypto will unexpectedly struggle under high interest rates and overly aggressive expectations. It will become more obvious that PE valuations are marked fraudulently. The AI boom will fade as the new techniques fail to produce revenue. The stock market will not do well.\n\nDOGE will deliver controversy and anger, but not significant changes in government spending. The Trump administration will tend to move more towards Wall Street expectations than those of its populist supporters on trade and immigration, though deportations will skyrocket.\n\nAny predictions on your end? I\u2019m particularly interested in what will happen in specific concentrated industries.\n\nTop Ten Articles\n\nHere are the top ten articles from BIG in 2024.\n\n(1) An Assassin Showed Just How Angry America Really Is (12/6/24)\n\n(2) A Post-Google World (9/7/24)\n\n(3) An Oil Price-Fixing Conspiracy Caused 27% of All Inflation Increases in 2021 (5/3/24)\n\n(4) FBI Raids Big Corporate Landlord Over Nationwide Rent Hikes (6/2/24)\n\n(5) Judges Rule Big Tech's Free Ride on Section 230 Is Over (8/29/24)\n\n(6) Economic Termites Preparing to Feast? (11/24/24)\n\n(7) Economic Termites Are Everywhere (6/8/24)\n\n(8) It\u2019s the Land, Stupid: How the Homebuilder Cartel Drives High Housing Prices (8/15/24)\n\n(9) On the Democratic Party's Cult of Powerlessness (11/18/24)\n\n(10) It's Time to Break Up Big Medicine (12/12/24)\n\nLooking Forward to 2025\n\nIn 2019, I started BIG, hoping to chronicle a growing anti-monopoly movement, which had its origins in its modern form in anger at Too Big To Fail banks, but goes back, if you want to trace it that far, to the 17th century fight between the Roundheads and the Jacobites in the English Civil War. It was never a pro vs anti government debate, it was always one of privilege against democracy.\n\nMartin Van Buren, the founder of the Democratic Party, drew this analogy explicitly, noting that his fight was for the common people against the speculators, the aristocrats, monopolists, and big landowners, and their collusive allies in government. Abraham Lincoln, the founder of the GOP, saw his fight similarly. \u201cLabor is the superior of capital,\u201d he said, \u201cand deserves much the higher consideration.\u201d\n\nThat is how I understand the argument today, as muddled as our politics and commerce might seem. I suspect that this coming year I\u2019m going to start focusing a bit more on finance and trade.\n\nAnd there we go. Happy new year. Thanks for reading. And keep those tips on monopolies flowing, they are essential to this work.\n\nAnd if you liked this issue of BIG, you can sign up here for more issues of BIG, a newsletter on how to restore fair commerce, innovation and democracy. If you really liked it, read my book, Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy.\n\ncheers,\n\nMatt Stoller",

            "content": "Shares of UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.48%) were pulling back in December due to a backlash against the company following the murder of one of its executives and reports of a potential crackdown on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), including UnitedHealth's OptumRx.\n\nOther media reports also shone a harsh light on the business and could lead to more regulation or an overhaul of some healthcare industry practices.\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock lost 17% last month. As you can see from the chart, the stock fell in three stages over the first half of December, and then traded sideways for the rest of the month.\n\nPressure mounts on UnitedHealth\n\nUnitedHealth stocks initially rose after Brian Thompson, the CEO of its insurance division, was murdered on Dec. 4, but it then fell sharply over the next two sessions as thousands of people on social media took the opportunity to vent their frustrations about the healthcare system and UnitedHealthcare's practices in particular. Among the data points that circulated in the days following the murder was a chart showing that UnitedHealth denied 32% of claims, double the industry average. Other reports showed that the company used an artificial intelligence (AI) model with a 90% error rate to deny claims. UnitedHealth later issued a statement pushing back on what it said were false claims, noting that it approves and pays 90% of medical claims upon submission.\n\nAfter a brief recovery early the following week, the stock fell again on reports that a bipartisan Senate bill would seek to break up PBMs, a major source of profit for UnitedHealth, Cigna, and CVS. All three health insurance stocks fell on the news, and the following week, President-elect Trump weighed in, saying he wanted to \"knock out the middle man\" in drug sales, referring to PBMs.\n\nFinally, at the end of the month, The Wall Street Journal reported that UnitedHealth's software often led doctors to make diagnoses that were irrelevant or wrong, the latest red flag about the company's practices.\n\nWhat's next for UnitedHealth?\n\nIt's unclear if there will be any meaningful regulatory changes that will impact UnitedHealth's business, but the bad press and general backlash could lead some customers to reconsider using the company as their insurance provider.\n\nEarly in the month, UnitedHealth reaffirmed its adjusted earnings per share guidance of $27.50-$27.75 for 2024 and forecast $29.50-$30 in adjusted EPS for 2025.\n\nAt its current price, the stock trades at a reasonable forward P/E of 17, but reputational and regulatory risk could weigh on the stock in 2025.",

            "content": "Friday, January 3, 2025 The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), as well as a micro-cap stock Smith-Midland Corp. (SMID). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Shares of UnitedHealth have declined -6.1% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry\u2019s decline of -9.9%. The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. The company\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. The Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $29.50-$30.00 band in 2025. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. However, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. A debt-laden balance sheet induces an increase in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. (You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>> ) Costco\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+41.1% vs. +25.1%). The company Being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer\u2019s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth. These factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects Costco to register an 11.5% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2025 on 6.6% revenue growth. This outlook reflects Costco\u2019s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside. (You can read the full research report on Costco here >>> ) Shares of IBM have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+41.6% vs. +10.9%). The company is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. Settlement of ongoing lawsuits with GlobalFoundries will pave the way for future collaboration and exploration of new revenue-generating opportunities. IBM is collaborating with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry. The collaboration is likely to facilitate higher productivity and help accelerate business transformation in consumer-packaged goods and retail firms. However, stiff competition in various end markets is straining profits. Stringent cost-cutting efforts to boost margins beyond a certain threshold are likely to impact product quality. Although the company generates significant cash flow, a high debt level can hinder its ability to sustain dividend payout and impact growth initiatives. (You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> ) Smith-Midland\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry over the past year (+68.6% vs. +0.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $233.51 million has demonstrated record revenue growth, driven by increased production volumes across its plants, especially for infrastructure-related projects. In the second quarter of 2024, revenues surged 34% year over year to $19.6 million, with a strong $59.2 million backlog supporting continued expansion. The utility segment also showed robust growth, particularly in the Northern Virginia market. The company is strategically positioned with key infrastructure contracts and a solid financial footing, including $7.3 million in cash and a low debt-to-capitalization ratio. However, concerns include revenue concentration, fluctuating demand in key product lines, exposure to inflation, operational risks and seasonal variability. Rising accounts receivable and the suspension of dividends could strain the company\u2019s cash flow and impact investor sentiment.

            "content": "The Change Healthcare cyberattack caused unprecedented disruptions for hospitals and providers, experts say.\n\nUnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said the company paid a $22 million ransom in the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Analysts say the attack, which affected 100 million people, is the most disruptive ever in the healthcare industry.\n\nAnalysts call it the worst cyberattack ever seen in the healthcare industry. UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Change Healthcare, gained national attention and scrutiny from lawmakers and industry leaders.\n\nStill, other cyberattacks and data breaches affected tens of millions of Americans over the past year.\n\nOrganizations suffering breaches of private health information that affect more than 500 people are required to report those incidents to the federal government. The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services database includes 576 data breaches affecting at least 500 individuals.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of the 10 largest health data breaches of 2024. The 10 largest breaches affected more than 141 million individuals, or more than 1 in 3 Americans, according to the health department. Millions more were affected by the hundreds of other breaches reported over the past 12 months.\n\nDuring a recent cybersecurity panel held by Chief Healthcare Executive\u00ae, Adam Zoller, the global chief information security officer for the Providence health system, said 2024 was \u201ca pretty wild year for healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cProvidence has been targeted by thousands of attacks, as we are every year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've thwarted these attacks. We've been able to, knock on wood, stay ahead of these attacks, but the attacks are growing in sophistication. They\u2019re growing in volume.\u201d\n\nRead more: Cybersecurity panel: How hospitals can protect their patients and their systems\n\n1. Change Healthcare cyberattack\n\nThe ransomware attack of Change Healthcare obviously surpassed all other health data breaches in 2024, or any other year. UnitedHealth Group said 100 million Americans were affected by the attack.\n\nNearly all hospitals and health systems suffered financial impacts of the attack, because Change Healthcare handles so many functions for providers, including claims, billing and prescription services. Providers were hampered because payment of claims was delayed.\n\nUnitedHealth paid billions of dollars in loans and advance payments to providers who were affected by the attack. UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty told lawmakers in May that the company also paid $22 million to the ransomware group behind the attack.\n\nLawmakers criticized UnitedHealth for failing to employ more robust defenses, and they also called on the government to take more substantial steps to ensure health organizations are focusing on cybersecurity.\n\nRead more: Hospitals face risks from cyberattacks aimed at vendors\n\n2. Kaiser Permanente\n\nIn most other years, the Kaiser Permanente breach would have emerged as the biggest of the year.\n\nThe California-based health system suffered a breach that affected over 13.4 million Americans. But this breach didn\u2019t come from a cyberattack. Kaiser Permanente says online technologies used by social media platforms may have sent personal information to other parties.\n\nKaiser Permanente said the data exposed included names and addresses, but there was apparently no disclosure of Social Security numbers or credit card numbers.\n\n3. Ascension Health\n\nThe health system suffered a cyberattack that affected nearly 5.6 million individuals, and the disruptions illustrated how breaches and attacks can affect patient care.\n\nAscension discovered the breach in May and the system postponed surgeries and appointments at some of its hospitals. Some hospitals had to divert ambulances to other facilities temporarily. Some Ascension facilities were without access to their electronic health records for weeks, and patients faced longer waits at clinics.\n\nIn a message on its website, Ascension said the data exposed varies but could include medical information, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and insurance information.\n\nAscension said in June that it appears the breach occurred when an employee inadvertently downloaded a malicious file.\n\n4. HealthEquity, Inc.\n\nThe Utah-based organization experienced a breach affecting 4.3 million individuals, according to the health department database.\n\nHealthEquity, which administers benefits including Health Savings Accounts, said in a notice filed with the Maine attorney general\u2019s office that the breach occurred in March and was confirmed in June.\n\nThe company said the exposed data primarily included sign-up information for accounts and benefits. Some of the data included names, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and payment card information. Some individuals had different types of data that were affected, and some data categories weren\u2019t exposed for some people, the company said.\n\n5. Concentra Health Services, Inc.\n\nA division of Select Medical, Concentra Health Services Inc. was impacted by a breach that affected nearly 4 million individuals, according to the health department database.\n\nConcentra offers occupational medicine, urgent care, physical therapy and other services at nearly 550 medical centers. The company also serves employers and operates more than 150 onsite medical facilities.\n\nConcentra said the breach occurred due to a third party, Perry Johnson & Associates, Inc.\n\n\u201cThis event occurred solely at PJ&A and was not the result of any activities or inactions on Concentra\u2019s part,\u201d Concentra said in a statement in February.\n\nPJ&A provides medical transcription services to healthcare organizations. The company said it has added security measures to prevent future attacks.\n\n6. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\n\nThe CMS suffered a data breach that affected more than 3.1 million individuals, illustrating that government agencies are vulnerable to breaches.\n\nThe breach stems from a 2023 cybersecurity incident involving MOVEit software, a third-party application used to transfer files, the CMS said in September. The Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation, a CMS contractor, discovered in May 2024 that an unauthorized party had copied some files. A previous review didn\u2019t discover any suspicious activity.\n\nThe CMS notified affected individuals that some of the data exposed could have included names and addresses, Social Security numbers, hospital account numbers and Medicare beneficiary identifiers.\n\nThe agency said it wasn\u2019t aware of any incidents of fraud or the improper use of private health data.\n\n7. Acadian Ambulance Service, Inc.\n\nThe Louisiana-based organization suffered a breach affecting nearly 2.9 million individuals, according to the health department.\n\nAcadian Ambulance Service said it detected suspicious activity and confirmed that someone gained access to the company\u2019s network between June 19 and June 21.\n\nThe company sent notices to those affected in August. Acadian said it found no evidence that any private health information was used for identity theft or fraud.\n\nBut the exposure included information such as Social Security numbers, birth dates and medical information.\n\nThe company provides ambulance services in Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas.\n\n8. Sav-Rx\n\nA&A Services, doing business as Sav-Rx, experienced a cyberattack that affected 2.8 million individuals, according to the health department.\n\nSav-Rx manages pharmacy benefits for health plans.\n\nIn a message to customers on its website, Sav-Rx said, \u201can unauthorized third party was able to access certain non-clinical systems and obtain certain files that contained personal information. However, in conjunction with third-party experts, we have confirmed that any data acquired from our IT system was destroyed and not further disseminated.\u201d\n\nSav-Rx said it conducted an investigation and isn\u2019t aware of third parties using the data, and the company said pharmacy systems were not affected. The company has offered free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to customers for two years.\n\nSav-Rx also said it has taken steps to bolster its cybersecurity.\n\n9. WebTPA\n\nWebTPA Employer Services, LLC experienced a data breach affecting more than 2.5 million people, according to the health department.\n\nThe company handles administrative services for benefits plans and insurance companies.\n\nWebTPA said in a statement that it detected suspicious activity on its network in late December and launched an investigation, which found that an unauthorized party may have obtained personal information. WebTPA said the investigation into the extent of the breach was completed in March 2024.\n\nThe Texas-based company said it\u2019s providing two years of identity monitoring services to customers. The information accessed included names, Social Security numbers, and insurance information, among others, the company said.\n\nIn notices to those affected, WebTPA said the company isn\u2019t aware of any misuse of information. The company said it also consulted cybersecurity experts to improve its defenses.\n\n10. INTEGRIS Health\n\nThe Oklahoma health system suffered a cyberattack affecting nearly 2.4 million people, according to the health department.\n\nINTEGRIS said in a message to patients and community members that intruders accessed private health information, including Social Security numbers, contact information, and birth dates. However, the system said no financial information or payment information was accessed.\n\nThe health system also said some individuals have been contacted by a group claiming responsibility for the breach, but INTEGRIS urged individuals not to respond or engage with the group.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Stock photo | ArtisticOperations via Pixabay\n\nSarena Neyman\n\nCall him a misguided hero or villain, but the man who killed the United Healthcare CEO struck a nerve, exposing a deep rage shared by many Americans across the political spectrum \u2014 anger at an industry that earns obscene profits from the suffering of others. His chilling act shifted the national conversation from immigration to corporate greed. Finally.\n\nFor too long, Americans have hesitated to criticize the super-rich. Chalk it up to our tribalist nature that has so many convinced that our financial struggles are caused not by wealth hoarding, but by those we view as outside our clan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory offers many examples. In Nazi Germany, Jews were blamed for a financial depression triggered by the American stock market crash. My parents and grandmother barely escaped; many in my family did not.\n\nDecades later, Ronald Reagan handed the wealthy the largest tax cuts in U.S. history while vilifying the \u201cwelfare queen\u201d who leached from the feeding trough of \u201cbig government.\u201d\n\nThis racist caricature was meant to distract from policies that began a 40-year transfer of wealth from the 90% to the 1%, producing the largest wealth gap in a century. It\u2019s a story about the undeserving poor vs. the deserving rich.\n\nToday, we face a similar narrative. Immigrants are blamed both for stealing jobs and freeloading despite their essential role in propping up our economy given our shrinking workforce. After being fed a steady anti-immigration media diet, it\u2019s not surprising that nearly four out of five Republicans support placing undocumented immigrants in internment camps.\n\nThe greater the wealth imbalance, the more the wealthy need to distort the truth. They peddle the long-discredited Trickle-Down theory, claiming that what benefits them benefits us all. But rising tides don\u2019t lift all boats when some people have no boat at all, or when their boats are sinking because the superyachts are capsizing small craft in their massive wake.\n\nWe have to stop believing that billionaires have working people\u2019s interests at heart. In fact, they\u2019re mutually exclusive. A gangbuster stock market depends on keeping wages low and unions banished. Outsized campaign contributions ensure that corporate taxes are slashed and regulations meant to keep us healthy, safe and not impoverished are gutted.\n\nIt makes complete sense that the wealth lobby exploits fears of \u201csocialism\u201d to keep people voting against their own interests. It\u2019s no coincidence the U.S. remains the only developed nation without universal health care. This is where our anger should be directed.\n\nBut redirecting anger is not easy. Six of the richest U.S. corporations control 90% of our media, and their profits depend on algorithms and news coverage designed to keep us divided, misinformed and distracted from this billionaire plunder. \u201cYou know the media has failed,\u201d says essayist Rebecca Solnit, \u201cwhen people are more concerned that a trans girl might play on a softball team than that the climate crisis will destroy our planet.\u201d\n\nDuring the next four years, it will be critical to get people to see through this deception. When we start feeling the fallout from a second Trump term, the scapegoating will intensify. Tariffs, more tax cuts for the rich and the loss of immigrant labor will send prices soaring and balloon the deficit. Many may lose health care, Social Security and worker protections. The wealth lobby will no doubt point fingers elsewhere.\n\nChange is possible, though. As a grant writer for 30 years, I\u2019ve seen campaigns shift public opinion on issues like marriage equality, net neutrality and climate change. Recently, several states won historic economic reforms after decades of trying. In Massachusetts, RiseUpMass won the nation\u2019s sixth millionaire\u2019s tax by debunking claims that it would harm retirees.\n\nIn Washington state, the Balance Our Tax Code, a coalition of 80-plus diverse groups from home health aide workers to members of the Yakima Nation, was able pass a capital gains tax, calling out Amazon and Microsoft for avoiding their share of taxes. \u201cThe biggest lesson we learned,\u201d said campaign communications manager Reiny Cohen, \u201cwas that when we come together and tell the same story, lawmakers have no choice but to listen.\u201d\n\nIn other words, changing minds requires a coordinated echo chamber. The #MeToo movement showed how the right framing, amplified through the media, can shift perspectives and galvanize action. Imagine if we could help more people connect the dots between stagnant wages, failing schools, a burning planet, unaffordable housing and the greed of the 1%.\n\nBut the message must go beyond bashing billionaires. It must present a compelling vision of what is possible if we stand up against the ultra-rich. The We Make Minnesota coalition was able to pass a tax increase on the wealthiest 1% by countering anti-Somali rhetoric with a \u201cWe\u2019re Better Off Together\u201d message. Instead of using a \u201cStop the Cuts\u201d framework, the campaign emphasized the subsidized health care, free preschool and tuition-free college programs the state is now able to offer.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about destroying capitalism. A healthy balance between a free market and protective government is essential. But when the richest among us prioritize profit over the well-being of the majority, it\u2019s no longer about politics \u2014 it\u2019s about survival.\n\nThe murder of the United Healthcare CEO, as horrendous as it was, forced us to confront the injustices we\u2019ve been taught to tolerate. This moment must unite us against the true enemies of the American dream: unchecked greed and exploitation of the many for the benefit of the few. We can either remain manipulated by scapegoating and fear or see the truth and demand change. Only then can we build a society where no one feels driven to such desperate measures again.\n\nSarena Neyman, syndicated by PeaceVoice, is a Massachusetts grant writer.",

            "content": "Perhaps that\u2019s because, as the Journal\u2019s investigations found, Medicare Advantage insurers routinely pad their government reimbursement requests with spurious diagnoses. For example, an astounding 66,000 Medicare Advantage patients were diagnosed with diabetic cataracts even after these patients had surgery to correct them, making that diagnosis, in the Journal\u2019s words, \u201canatomically impossible.\u201d In other instances, patients whom Medicare Advantage insurers reported as HIV positive received none of the recommended treatments. If a doctor failed to furnish a desired diagnosis, insurers dispatched a nurse to the patient\u2019s home to find one. Medicare Advantage insurers also conned veterans into enrolling in the program even though they were already covered adequately by the Veterans Administration health system, which has repeatedly been demonstrated to be superior to private hospital care (something else the public is reluctant to believe).\n\nUnitedHealth, the parent company of United Healthcare, whose chief executive, Brian Thompson, was assassinated last month, is, according to the Journal, a particular offender, furnishing doctors with checklists of possible diagnoses. Looking at Medicare data between 2019 and 2022, the Journal found that patients who moved from traditional Medicare to UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans \u201cgot 55 percent sicker, on paper\u201d during their first year in Medicare Advantage. (UnitedHealth replied in a written statement that it provided \u201cmore accurate diagnoses\u201d and alleged, without providing evidence, that the Journal\u2019s reporting method was flawed.)\n\nSo, OK, Medicare Advantage charges the federal government more. Don\u2019t I want, as a patient, more money to be lavished on my health care? The sickest customers do not. People in their final years of life left Medicare Advantage for traditional Medicare \u201cat double the rate of other enrollees\u201d between 2016 and 2022, the Journal reported in November. This exodus of expensively dying patients saved Medicare Advantage $10 billion during this period.",

Luigi Mangione was arrested on charges of the killing.\n\nMajority of Americans don't blame Luigi Mangione solely\n\n\n\n'Supervisors laughed as patients cried for money'\n\n\n\nA former UnitedHealthcare employee has revealed that they were systematically trained to deny medical claims and the training went for the first two or three months with supervisors standing behind and monitoring how quickly the representative is getting off the call. Natalie Collins told NewsNatoions that there was no instruction on how to actually pay the claim but the entire training was about different ways to deny the claim.\u201cWe weren\u2019t given proper instruction to actually pay the claim, and there wasn\u2019t enough monies in certain files in certain companies to pay medical claims,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe would have to just get the client off the phone as fast as we could.\u201dUnitedHealthcare sprang to the news after its CEO Brian Thompson was murdered in front of a New York hotel. 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was arrested on charges of the murder but he pleaded not guilty. Mangione was not a customer of UnitedHealthcare but according to the investigators, he took up the murder as vigilante work.Apart from the online lionization of Mangione because of his looks, and Ivy League college education, the majority of Americans don't hold Luigi Mangione solely responsible for Brian Thompson's death. They blame health insurance profits and coverage denials too for the murder of Thompson. An NORC poll reveals that 8 in 10 adults said that Mangione has a \"great deal\" or a \"moderate amount\" of responsibility for the December 4 shooting but about 7 in 10 adults said denials for health care coverage by insurance companies or the profits made by health insurance companies also bear at least a \"moderate\" amount of responsibility.Earlier, Prison consultant Sam Mangel who is working with other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center revealed that Luigi Mangione is sleeping on a mattress that's 2 inches thick at best and has no separate pillow.Collins, the former UnitedHealthcare staff, said the supervisors used to laugh as desperate patients used to cry for money. Collins quit her position after attempting to approve payment for a widowed mother of five whose husband died of pancreatic cancer. The supervisors ihad instructed her to deny the claim and get the caller of the phone line. \u201cThey just wouldn\u2019t allow me to submit the claim. There would be alerts on each claim telling us that either we had to put it back in our queue and it would just go to someone else, 30 days later, 60 days later,\u201d Collins said.Collins said she condemns violence though she understands public anger. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone should die \u2026 but people are angry. People have reasons to be very angry, and I feel that to my bones. I\u2019ve seen it, I lived it, I processed them and I denied them.\u201d",

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nWhile the market has experienced earnings growth lately, UnitedHealth Group's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, UnitedHealth Group would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 33% decrease to the company's bottom line. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 4.7% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\n\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 32% per annum over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 11% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.\n\nWith this information, we can see why UnitedHealth Group is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\n\nThe Final Word\n\nWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\n\nWe've established that UnitedHealth Group maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nYou always need to take note of risks, for example - we think you should be aware of.\n\nOf course, you might also be able to find a better stock than UnitedHealth Group.

His chilling act shifted the national conversation from immigration to corporate greed. Finally.\n\nFor too long, Americans have hesitated to criticize the super-rich. Chalk it up to our tribalist nature that has so many convinced that our financial struggles are caused not by wealth hoarding but by those we view as outside our clan.\n\nHistory offers many examples. In Nazi Germany, Jews were blamed for a financial depression triggered by the American stock market crash. My parents and grandmother barely escaped; many in my family did not.\n\nDecades later, Ronald Reagan handed the wealthy the largest tax cuts in US history while vilifying the \u201cWelfare Queen\u201d who leached from the feeding trough of \u201cBig Government.\u201d\n\nThis racist caricature was meant to distract from policies that began a 40-year transfer of wealth from the 90 percent to the one percent, producing the largest wealth gap in a century. It\u2019s a story about the undeserving poor vs. the deserving rich.\n\nToday, we face a similar narrative. Immigrants are blamed both for stealing jobs and freeloading despite their essential role in propping up our economy given our shrinking workforce. After being fed a steady anti-immigration media diet, it\u2019s not surprising that nearly four out of five Republicans support placing undocumented immigrants in internment camps.\n\nThe greater the wealth imbalance, the more the wealthy need to distort the truth. They peddle the long-discredited Trickle-Down theory, claiming that what benefits them benefits us all. But rising tides don\u2019t lift all boats when some people have no boat at all, or when their boats are sinking because the superyachts are capsizing small craft in their massive wake.\n\nWe have to stop believing that billionaires have working people\u2019s interests at heart. In fact, they\u2019re mutually exclusive. A gangbuster stock market depends on keeping wages low and unions banished. Outsized campaign contributions ensure that corporate taxes are slashed and regulations meant to keep us healthy, safe, and not impoverished are gutted.\n\nIt makes complete sense that the wealth lobby exploits fears of \u201csocialism\u201d to keep people voting against their own interests. It\u2019s no coincidence the U.S. remains the only developed nation without universal healthcare. This is where our anger should be directed.\n\nBut redirecting anger is not easy. Six of the richest US corporations control 90 percent of our media and their profits depend on algorithms and news coverage designed to keep us divided, misinformed, and distracted from this billionaire plunder. \u201cYou know the media has failed,\u201d says essayist Rebecca Solnit, \u201cwhen people are more concerned that a trans girl might play on a softball team than that the climate crisis will destroy our planet.\u201d\n\nDuring the next four years it will be critical to get people to see through this deception. When we start feeling the fallout from a second Trump term, the scapegoating will intensify. Tariffs, more tax cuts for the rich, and the loss of immigrant labor will send prices soaring and balloon the deficit. Many may lose healthcare, Social Security, and worker protections. The wealth lobby will no doubt point fingers elsewhere.\n\nChange is possible though. As a grant writer for 30 years, I\u2019ve seen campaigns shift public opinion on issues like marriage equality, net neutrality, and climate change. Recently, several states won historic economic reforms after decades of trying. In Massachusetts, RiseUpMass won the nation\u2019s sixth millionaire\u2019s tax by debunking claims it would harm retirees.\n\nIn Washington state, the Balance Our Tax Code, a coalition of over 80 diverse groups, from home health aide workers to members of the Yakima Nation, was able pass a capital gains tax, calling out Amazon and Microsoft for avoiding their share of taxes. \u201cThe biggest lesson we learned,\u201d said campaign communications manager Reiny Cohen \u201cwas that when we come together and tell the same story, lawmakers have no choice but to listen.\u201d\n\nIn other words, changing minds requires a coordinated echo chamber. The #MeToo movement showed how the right framing, amplified through the media, can shift perspectives and galvanize action. Imagine if we could help more people connect the dots between stagnant wages, failing schools, a burning planet, unaffordable housing, and the greed of the one percent.\n\nBut the message must go beyond bashing billionaires. It must present a compelling vision of what is possible if we stand up against the ultra rich. The We Make Minnesota coalition was able to pass a tax increase on the wealthiest one percent by countering anti-Somali rhetoric with a \u201cWe\u2019re Better Off Together\u201d message. Instead of using a \u201cStop the Cuts\u201d framework, the campaign emphasized the subsidized health care, free preschool, and tuition-free college programs the state is now able to offer.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about destroying capitalism. A healthy balance between a free market and protective government is essential. But when the richest among us prioritize profit over the well-being of the majority, it\u2019s no longer about politics\u2014it\u2019s about survival.\n\nThe murder of the United Healthcare CEO, as horrendous as it was, forced us to confront the injustices we\u2019ve been taught to tolerate. This moment must unite us against the true enemies of the American dream: unchecked greed and exploitation of the many for the benefit of the few. We can either remain manipulated by scapegoating and fear or see the truth and demand change. Only then can we build a society where no one feels driven to such desperate measures again.",

            "content": "Police investigating the shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Dec. 4, 2024, have announced that the suspected assailant had used a 3D-printed gun. Several high-profile crimes in recent years have involved this kind of homemade, or partially homemade, weapon.\n\nOften called \"ghost guns\" because they can be hard to trace, these firearms can be either partially or completely made with components that have been produced in metal or plastic on commercially available 3D printers. The U.S. Supreme Court is considering the legality of current federal restrictions on these firearms.\n\nRELATED: A rise of gun switches in crimes prompts a push for stricter laws against them\n\nThe first known criminal case involving a 3D-printed gun resulted in the arrest of a U.K. man in 2013. But since then, police worldwide have reported finding increasing numbers of these weapons.\n\nMy research focuses on the economic and social effects of advanced digital technologies, including 3D printing. I see that the use of 3D-printed guns in criminal and violent activities is likely to continue to increase. And it will likely prove ever harder for governments and police to regulate these firearms.\n\nSurge in arrests and seizures\n\nArrests and seizures connected to 3D-printed guns are escalating quickly. Between 2017 and 2021, U.S. law enforcement agencies seized and reported nearly 38,000 suspected ghost guns, according to a 2024 report from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In 2021 alone, 19,273 suspected ghost guns were traced, a significant increase from 8,504 in 2020. The number of seized 3D-printed guns in New York state alone surged dramatically, from 100 in 2019 to 637 in 2022.\n\nArrests linked to 3D-printed guns are also rising. The world recorded 108 arrests in the first half of 2023, compared to 66 arrests in all 2022.\n\nNorth America leads in 3D-printed gun-related arrests, with 166 cases from 2013 to June 2023. Europe followed with 48 arrests, while Oceania ranked third with 24 arrests.\n\nThe U.S. is a particular hot spot, with 36% of total global arrests related to 3D-printed firearms in 2023. But Canada is close behind, with 34%. The U.K. had 10%, and Australia had 8%.\n\nGrowing global security threat\n\nPolice and media reports indicate that many efforts to acquire or manufacture 3D-printed firearms were connected to plans for violent actions.\n\nThese guns have been used by diverse groups including far-right extremists, ethno-separatists, jihadists, left-wing anarchists, organized crime groups in Europe and pro-democracy rebels in Myanmar.\n\nFrom 2019 to mid-2022, there were at least nine documented cases in Europe and Australia of extremists, terrorists or paramilitary groups either producing or attempting to produce firearms using 3D-printing technology. An analysis of 165 cases of 3D-printed firearms from 2013 to mid-2024 reveals that 15% were linked to terrorism. Far-right groups appear to be the most frequent users among terrorism-related cases.\n\nA widely varied legal landscape\n\nOften, 3D-printed guns are homemade firearms without serial numbers. This lack of identification makes them attractive to criminals because it is harder for law enforcement to link specific guns to particular crimes or suspects. Different countries take very different approaches to regulating these weapons.\n\nJapan enforces stringent laws governing the manufacture, possession and sales of firearms. Its legal system strictly prohibits unauthorized firearm production, including 3D-printed guns. In 2014, a 28-year-old Japanese man was sentenced to two years in prison for producing plastic 3D-printed firearms.\n\nIn 2023, Canada effectively banned ghost guns. It is illegal to possess or manufacture them without a license from the government.\n\nIn Australia, making a 3D-printed firearm is illegal, and in some states, possessing a digital blueprint to create one is also an offense. In the state of New South Wales, a person convicted of possessing blueprints can face up to 14 years in prison. In Tasmania state, the punishment can be even more severe \u2013 up to 21 years in prison.\n\nAcross the European Union, making or owning homemade firearms, including 3D-printed ones, is broadly prohibited. However, laws and penalties vary, with some nations criminalizing even the possession of digital files or blueprints related to 3D-printing guns.\n\nIn the U.K., where firearms are very restricted, 3D-printed guns have been considered illegal. But in November 2022, the government updated the laws to specifically ban possessing, buying or producing parts for 3D-printed guns. The proposal aims to explicitly ban 3D-printed guns, addressing their unique challenges directly, rather than relying on existing laws designed for traditional firearms. The U.K. National Crime Agency has called for a ban on possessing blueprints as well, and Parliament is currently considering two bills proposing such a ban.\n\nFederal rules in the US\n\nThe U.S. Constitution poses some unique challenges to regulating ghost guns, especially for the federal government, but also for states.\n\nFor regular firearms \u2013 that is, those not produced by 3D printing \u2013 U.S. federal law requires that a key component, called the lower receiver, bear a unique serial number. Purchasing a lower receiver requires a federal background check and conducting the transaction through a merchant who holds a Federal Firearms License.\n\nThe situation is more complicated when it comes to 3D printing weapons. The First Amendment to the Constitution protects freedom of expression, which includes sharing digital files that could contain firearm designs. And the Second Amendment protects citizens' right to bear arms.\n\nIn the U.S., selling 3D-printed firearms requires a federal license. But producing or owning homemade firearms for personal use is allowed. That includes 3D-printing the lower receiver component, and assembling the rest of the weapon with unregulated parts.\n\nCurrent federal law, under review by the Supreme Court, also requires 3D-printed guns meet specific guidelines, even if they do not contain any currently regulated firearms components. Under the rule, makers of ghost gun kits must obtain a federal license, conduct background checks, record information about their customers and add serial numbers to their products.\n\nThe type of weapon also matters when determining the legality of a 3D-printed firearm. Automatic weapons, or machine guns, can continue to fire ammunition as long as the user holds the trigger down. These weapons have been heavily regulated by federal law for almost 90 years.\n\nCriminals have used 3D printers to produce \"Glock switches\" or auto-sears, which convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic machine guns. That turns those items into machine guns under federal law, making them illegal. Owning this kind of 3D-printed conversion device can lead to a maximum of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nIn the states\n\nThe states can also regulate firearms, and many are trying to get control of 3D-printed guns.\n\nBy November 2024, 15 U.S. states had established regulations on ghost guns, though exact requirements vary. The rules typically require a serial number, background checks for firearm component purchases and reporting to authorities that a person is producing 3D-printed guns.\n\nFor instance, in New Jersey, a 2019 law mandates that all ghost guns have a serial number and be registered. Under current New York law, possession or distribution of a 3D-printed gun is classified as a misdemeanor. However, a proposed law seeks to elevate the manufacturing of firearms using 3D-printing technology to a felony offense.\n\nAs technology advances and rules evolve, criminals who use 3D-printed firearms will continue to pose threats to public safety and security, and governments will continue playing catch-up to effectively regulate these weapons.\n\nNir Kshetri, Professor of Management, University of North Carolina \u2013 Greensboro\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "content": "While the shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson has sparked a public discussion around America\u2019s private healthcare industry and political violence, one of the charges against the alleged shooter, Luigi Mangione, has sparked a legal debate over whether his alleged actions constitute \u201cterrorism\u201d and what the effect of the special treatment officials are giving the case will have on a potential trial.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office earlier this month hit Mangione with 11 charges, including murder in the first degree in the furtherance of terrorism, a charge that has been scrutinized by many in the legal community.\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Michigan, told Salon that the terrorism charge fits the state's definition of terrorism. In New York, a crime is considered terrorism if it is done \u201cwith intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.\u201d\n\nIn McQuade\u2019s view, Mangione\u2019s alleged assassination of Thompson qualifies as an action made with \u201cintent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.\u201d She cited that the shooter \u201cput the words on the bullets\u201d and the materials found with Mangione at the time of his arrest as evidence that he allegedly sought to intimidate those at the helm of the healthcare industry.\n\n\u201cThis case is really more than just a garden variety murder case,\u201d McQuade said. \u201cI think I agree with the charging decision here in that it is political violence and that, in order to deter political violence, we need to send a message that this is above and beyond garden variety murder.\u201d\n\nJaved Ali, a law professor at the University of Michigan, agreed with McQuade and noted that the shooting is being treated as an act of terror by New York officials in more ways than just the charges. Ali pointed to the Mangione\u2019s perp walk, where he was surrounded by heavily armed law enforcement as well as Mayor Eric Adams. He said it bore similarities to the perp walk of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, who killed 168 people in 1995.\n\nAli said that the perp walk demonstrates that New York officials are giving the shooting special weight, though he noted that the terror charge could be dropped as the trial approaches if prosecutors feel it might be hard to prove.\n\nWe need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism\n\nThe special attention Mangione\u2019s case is receiving from law enforcement officials, however, is part of what some lawyers are scrutinizing about the handling of the shooting.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Salon that he sees the terrorism charge as a \u201cstretch\u201d and says that he thinks the decision to charge Mangione with an act of terror moves the focus of the case from Thompson\u2019s killing onto the health insurance industry in America.\n\n\u201cTerrorism requires either the intent to intimidate the public or to influence the government,\u201d Rahmani said. \u201cNow all of a sudden, the health insurance industry and his motivation all come into evidence in what would otherwise be a pretty clear murder case.\u201d\n\nUnlike other New York cases where terrorism has been alleged, like the white supremacist shooting at a Tops supermarket in 2022, there is widespread public support for Mangione and the unusual treatment that his case is receiving, Rahmani said, might only make it harder for prosecutors to win in court\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s atypical\u2014the way the whole case has been handled. You have Eric Adams, who is under indictment himself, at the perp walk,\u201d Rahmani said. \u201cI see a very real risk of jury nullification in the case. I haven't seen something like this since OJ, where there is so much sympathy for the accused.\u201d\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nJeremy Saland, a criminal defense lawyer and former Manhattan prosecutor, agreed that the charge was a \"stretch\" and \"offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall the Southern District swooping in or Mayor Adams coming in for any time a domestic abuser crosses state lines,\u201d Saland said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re going to stand behind victims of domestic violence with the same voice.\u201d\n\nHe said the charge was offensive for two reasons: First, it sends a message to the families of victims of more mundane murders that the state and city see Thompson\u2019s murder as far more important than others. Secondly, he said that delving into the alleged political motivations of the shooting has shifted the focus of the case.\n\n\u201cAll of this has become about Mangione and you forgetting about Thompson,\u201d Saland said. \u201cThis does no justice to Brian Thompson and no justice to the criminal justice system. This does no justice to the victims of \u2018regular\u2019 murders.\u201d\n\nOne other possibility, suggested by Ali, is that prosecutors brought the terrorism charge against Mangione in the hopes of getting him to agree to a plea deal, which could include an agreement to drop the first-degree murder charge and get him to plead guilty to second-degree murder, which he is also charged with.\n\nAli also noted that the sequencing of the state and federal cases against Mangione could influence one another. In federal court, Mangione is charged with using a firearm to commit murder and stalking. The former of those charges could result in the death penalty, a punishment the incoming Trump administration is expected to use liberally. Because of this, Mangione\u2019s state-level case might not even go forward if his federal trial happens first, Ali said.",

Click to read more.\n\nVideo footage taken on 4th of December 2024 shows a hooded person emerge out from the shadows on a New York City street at night to shoot a man in the back of the head in front of a Manhattan hotel.\n\nThe video plays like a scene from a spy thriller, and allegedly captures Ivy League graduate Luigi Mangione murdering Brian Thompson, who was the CEO of the largest health insurer in the United States, United Healthcare Group.\n\nMr Mangione was arrested whilst allegedly in possession of a 3D-printed gun in the Pennsylvanian city of Altoona on 9 December 2024. Yet, by the time the 26-year-old from a wealthy Baltimore family was apprehended, Mangione had already been bestowed hero status by much of the population due to the stark injustices of the US health insurance industry.\n\nThe United States is notorious for its non-provision of public healthcare, as well as for the manner in which its health insurers overcharge clients and then repeatedly deny them coverage when they develop medical issues.\n\nThe announcement that investigators had found the words \u201cdelay\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d engraved upon the bullets used to gun down the chief executive confirmed to the public what had already been suspected, which was that the killer was pushing back against the injustices of the US health insurance system in the commission of the crime.\n\n\u2018Delay, deny and depose\u2019 is a well-known slogan used to decry the numerous denials of the US health insurance industry.\n\nIn the immediate wake of the alleged murder offence, however, United States citizens turned to social media not to condemn the killing but to angrily denounce the industry that the CEO represented and numerous individuals shared their own stories of being denied health insurance coverage. And since he was taken into custody, Luigi has received widespread veneration.\n\nIndeed, the turning of a CEO killer into a modern-day lethal Robin Hood appears to be a development that depends upon the present moment, as a recent survey found that young people consider other factors to be more chiefly at play in causing Thompson\u2019s death than the actual killer himself, although a majority of the elderly consider Mangione bears principal responsibility.\n\nLoading up charges\n\nDespite having meticulously planned the murder over a number of months, Mangione was identified as a result of being captured on CCTV footage at the hostel where he\u2019d stayed, when he lowered his face mask to flirt with a receptionist and then following the killing, the young man got in a New York City taxi and stared straight into the vehicle\u2019s camera, with his mask on, and his photo was taken.\n\nAfter the authorities widely distributed the image in respect of the person of interest and posted a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest, a McDonald\u2019s employee at an Altoona outlet called the police on spotting Mangione sitting in the fast food restaurant. And the suspect was then transported from Pennsylvania and placed in the custody of the New York Police Department.\n\nFollowing his detainment, Mangione has appeared in three different courts, which has seen him rack up 20 different charges, and he\u2019s pleaded not guilty to all.\n\nThe state of Pennsylvania charged Luigi on 19 December, with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records, possessing an item used in a crime and providing false identification to police.\n\nThe US federal court then laid three charges against Mangione\u2019s name later that same day, which bring into play the potential for the death penalty. The federal charges involve murder using a firearm, two counts of stalking and one further count of using a weapon equipped with a silencer.\n\nMangione then appeared in the New York Supreme Court on 23 December, to plead not guilty to eleven charges against his name, which include murder in the first degree and murder as an act of terrorism.\n\nThe charge of murder as an act of terrorism gives rise to the suggestion that Mangione killed in an attempt to encourage others to take similar action against the health insurance sector and it also confirms suggestions that US authorities are concerned that copycat crimes involving the assassinations of heads of industry may be forthcoming.\n\nAnd the fact that supporters of Mangione are currently crowdfunding in order to finance his defence, with $200,000 having been raised by Christmas Eve, may further contribute to the paranoia around the idea of copycat incidents.\n\n\u201cParasites had it coming\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the Feds, I\u2019ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country,\u201d Mangione\u2019s alleged manifesto reads. \u201cTo save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn\u2019t working with anyone.\u201d\n\nMangione then apologises for any \u201ctrauma\u201d he might have caused, however, the killing \u201chad to be done\u201d, he continues, because \u201cthese parasites simply had it coming\u201d.\n\nThe alleged killer then outlines that the problematic state of the US healthcare system is underscored by the fact that it\u2019s the world\u2019s most expensive, yet life expectancy in the US comes in at 42nd worldwide.\n\nThe Ivy Leaguer then suggests that UnitedHealthcare is the largest company in the States, after Apple, Walmart and Google, however it\u2019s not benefitting the health of US constituents but rather its turning an immense profit sourced from the American public.\n\n\u201cObviously, the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly, I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument,\u201d Mangione further set out in his three-page document.\n\n\u201cBut many have illuminated the corruption and greed\u2026 decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play.\u201d\n\nSparking a nonviolent movement\n\nYouTube station Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan recently attended a rally for the release of Luigi Mangione at New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park on 21 December, where demonstrators likened the young man to Martin Luther King Junior and Gandhi, and one individual shared his story of how the health insurance sector has failed him miserably.\n\nThe University of Chicago has conducted a survey which found that only four in ten young people said Mangione bears a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of the responsibility for the murder, while six in ten 30- to 59-year-olds consider the young man bears \u201ca great deal\u201d of the responsibility, and, in terms of those over 60, eight in ten consider Luigi is primarily to blame.\n\nBut while US authorities fear a spate of CEO murders, those on the left are discussing the potential for Mangione\u2019s actions to spark a new nonviolent protest movement that targets corporates directly, rather than governments, which have long been progressing policies to deflect society\u2019s grievances against the actions of corporations being laid at the feet of those responsible.",

UnitedHealth\u2019s software wouldn\u2019t let doctors move on to their next patients until they weighed in on each diagnosis, which were often irrelevant or wrong, the Journal reports. UnitedHealth sometimes suggested a hormonal condition, secondary hyperaldosteronism, that was so obscure one doctor had to turn to Google for help, the paper points out. More diagnoses make for higher Medicare Advantage scores and larger payments to the company, it adds. A Wall Street Journal analysis found sickness scores increased when patients moved from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage, leading to billions of dollars in extra government payments to insurers. Patients examined by doctors working for UnitedHealth had some of the biggest increases in sickness scores after moving from traditional Medicare to the company\u2019s plans, according to the Journal\u2019s analysis of Medicare data between 2019 and 2022. Sickness scores for those UnitedHealth patients increased 55%, on average, in their first year in the plans, the analysis showed. That far outpaced the 7% year-over-year rise in the sickness scores of patients who stayed in traditional Medicare, according to the analysis.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nPublished first on TheFly \u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

Wall Enterprises.\n\n\"Destructive demolition\" of the site by sub-contractor MRD Group is expected to begin in mid-January, wrote T. Wall Enterprises development manager Jake Bunz in an email to the Press-Gazette, with complete demolition anticipated by July 2025.\n\nWhile the village of Howard initially announced an end-of-year demolition timeline at its Dec. 9 Village board meeting, Bunz explained that the village had been given a rough timeline for planning purposes earlier this year, \"so the timeline that the village laid out was our original timeline. So what [the village] showed could've been carry-over from earlier.\"\n\n\"Demolition takes months,\" wrote T. Wall Enterprises CEO Terrence Wall before detailing a six-step plan already set in motion to raze the area.\n\nAmong the activities largely invisible from the outside since September, the Brown County Sheriff's Office has used the building for training as has the Howard Fire Rescue team and Green Bay Police Department, according to the developer. Habitat for Humanity has also taken out desired parts to resell.\n\nSince the village secured demolition approval on Oct. 16, contactors have nearly completed gutting the campus of its hazardous material, electrical equipment, generators, HVAC, and cell antennae to prepare the insides for demolition, according to Bunz.\n\n\"Sometime in March, before the exterior comes down, we may host a public event at the building, in particular for anyone who worked there,\" Wall said. \"And that would kick off the exterior demolition \u2014 usually with me on the backhoe taking the first strike.\"\n\nOut of the rubble will come the plan that T. Wall Enterprises shared with the Press-Gazette that slightly updates plans reported earlier this year.\n\nAmong the revisions: the combined 1,233 apartment, office, and hotel units are expected to be constructed in buildings all four stories tall; apartment buildings B1 through B5 will center around a courtyard; buildings A7 through A10 will look out over pickleball courts; a play area will sit at the foot of buildings A5 and A6.\n\nSingle-family homes and townhomes will still border Security Boulevard, Quarterback Lane, and Green and Gold Street. Two retail spaces will still flank the entrance that leads to a cul-de-sac with a clubhouse at the end.\n\nAnd the acknowledgement that \"building size, unit counts and parking counts are subject to change as each phase develops\" still indicates that much will remain in flux until the project's completion. As of now, the village anticipates some buildings won't begin construction until the very end of the 27-year lifetime of the special tax district helping to finance the redevelopment.\n\nJesse Lin is a reporter covering the community of Green Bay and its surroundings, as well as politics in northeastern Wisconsin.

The company has surpassed Wall Street's bottom-line estimates in the past four quarters. In the most recent quarter, the company exceeded the consensus EPS estimate by 1.9% margin.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect UNH to report EPS of $27.61, up 9.9% from $25.12 in fiscal 2023 . Looking forward to fiscal 2025, EPS is expected to grow nearly 8% year-over-year to $29.81.\n\nUNH has underperformed the broader markets in 2024, with shares down 3.2% , compared to the S&P 500 Index's ( $SPX ) 24.2% gain and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLV ) 1.1% return on a YTD basis.\n\nDespite reporting better-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS of $7.15 and revenue of $100.8 billion, shares of UnitedHealth Group dropped 8.1% on Oct. 15 due to disappointing guidance revisions and increased costs. The company lowered its full-year adjusted EPS range to $27.50 - $27.75, signaling narrowing profit expectations. Additionally, higher-than-expected medical costs, reflected in an elevated medical care ratio (MCR) of 85.2%, raised investor concerns about cost pressures. The impact of a cyberattack and a decline in global commercial and Medicaid membership further exacerbated negative sentiment.\n\nAnalysts' consensus rating on UNH stock is bullish, with a \"Strong Buy\" rating overall. Out of 24 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 22 \"Strong Buys\u201d and two \"Moderate Buys.\" This configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago, with 21 analysts suggesting a \"Strong Buy.\"\n\nThe average analyst price target for UNH is $641.08, suggesting a potential upside of 26.5% from current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

UnitedHealth Group chairman Andrew Witty has been quietly informing the company executives that the company will see record figures by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported. The revenue at the UnitedHealth Group was more than $299 billion through September -- which is a record high and up from $277 billion last year. 26-year-old Luigi Mangione has been arrested in connection with the murder and charged with first-degree, second-degree and federal murder. Mangione was never a customer of the insurance company but apparently targeted Brian Thompson because UnitedHealthcare checked all boxes as his target was one of the medical insurance companies.Business was usual till December 3 for UHC until CEO Brian Thompson was killed in New York. Several social media users celebrated the killing as they complained that Thompson's company caused many deaths by denying insurance payments.Andrew Witty tried to boost the morale of the company staff and asked them to not speak to the media. \u201cThe environment we find ourselves in is a complex one, not one that was ever designed by anybody,\u201d Witty told workers on video on December 23.\u201cRight now, people continue to have strong feelings inside the organization, maybe nervous, maybe anxious, maybe worried about security,\u201d he said.As December has been harrowing for the company, especially for the UHC workers, the UnitedHealth Group leadership reportedly allowed workers to stay home if they don't feel safe coming to work and armed security has been deployed at its Minnesota headquarters, a report said. For the protection of other executives, their photos were removed from the company website.A former employee of UnitedHealthcare, Natalie Collins, recently said the company used to train people on various ways to decline insurance claims but there was no training on how to actually approve insurance claims. Collins said they were taught by the supervisors to get the client off the telephone as soon as possible",

Photo: HFN screenshot\n\nUnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty has been playing defense over the backlash of consumer complaints against the health insurance industry and most recently, around The Wall Street Journal's reporting on Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nSince the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson on December 4, social media posts about claim denials and prior authorizations that have delayed surgery appear to support the manifesto found on alleged killer Luigi Mangione, 26, against corporate America and its profits. Mangione is charged with first degree murder of Thompson, who headed the country's largest health insurer.\n\nWhile not specifically mentioning Thompson or UnitedHealthcare, Mangione's entry in his notebook for October 22 said \"the target is insurance\" because \"it checks every box,\" according to the federal complaint reported by ABC News.\n\nThroughout, Witty has sought to clarify the insurer's practices, first in an op-ed published December 13 in The New York Times.\n\n\"We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people's frustrations with it,\" Witty wrote. \"No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It's a patchwork built over decades. Our mission is to help make it work better,\" Witty wrote under the headline \"The Health Care System Is Flawed. Let's Fix It.\"\n\nUnitedHealth Group has clarified that Mangione did not have UnitedHealthcare as his health insurance.\n\n\"Regarding the murder of Brian Thompson, we are re-affirming that the killer and his parents were not UnitedHealthcare members,\" UnitedHealth Group said in a Dec. 13 post on its website.\n\nIn the same Dec. 13 post, the company responded to what it called misinformation by issuing an update on claim-approval rates.\n\nUnitedHealthcare approves and pays about 90% of medical claims upon submission, the post said.\n\n\"Importantly, of those that require further review, around one-half of one percent are due to medical or clinical reasons. Highly inaccurate and grossly misleading information has been circulated about our company's treatment of insurance claims,\" UnitedHealth Group said.\n\nForemost has been Witty's defense of Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nOn Dec. 30, through the company's website, Witty responded to what he called \"misleading\" articles published in The Wall Street Journal around Medicare Advantage plans.\n\n\"In a series of misleading articles, the Wall Street Journal has waged a one-sided, biased attack on Medicare Advantage (MA) \u2013 a program millions of seniors rely on for healthcare,\" Witty said. \"The narratives woven through the articles rely on often incomplete and inaccurate data to conduct flawed studies through a murky government 'agreement,' and clearly demonstrate that the Journal does not understand the Medicare Advantage program, how it is designed to function or why it differs from the traditional fee-for-service program which emphasizes volume over quality and patient outcomes.\"\n\nTo staff, Witty has said their work is valued, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\"Right now, people continue to have strong feelings inside the organization, maybe nervous, maybe anxious, maybe worried about security,\" Witty reportedly said in a video sent to employees on December 23, the WSJ said.\n\nIn recent weeks, some employees have received emailed threats, the report said, adding that the company has told staffers to remain at home if they don't feel safe. A person familiar with the UnitedHealth reportedly told the WSJ that armed guards now patrol its headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nThrough the same video, Witty also reportedly said he anticipates hitting financial records by year's end.\n\nEmail the writer: SMorse@himss.org",

As CEO, he must now manage analyst and investor expectations while rebuilding public trust, especially as the health insurance sector faces increased scrutiny from consumers and Congress.\n\n\"The environment we find ourselves in is a complex one, not one that was ever designed by anybody,\" Witty said in a video sent to employees and viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWitty is also working on keeping employees safe with online messaging now under company monitor and armed security guards placed at the company's Minnesota headquarters following Thompson\u2019s killing.\n\nRead Also: UnitedHealthcare CEO Murder Suspect: Chronic Pain, Unabomber Fascination, Isolation Details Emerge\n\nWhat's Next: UnitedHealth Group will report fourth-quarter financial results before the market opens on Jan. 16. Analysts expect the company to report revenue of $101.77 billion, up from $94.43 billion year-over-year, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $6.73, up from $6.16 in last year's fourth quarter.\n\nThe company has beaten analyst revenue estimates in eight of the last 10 quarters and beaten earnings per share estimate in nine of the last 10 quarters.\n\nRevenue through the first nine months is $299 billion, a company record and up from $277 billion through the first nine months of 2023.\n\nMangione recently pleaded not guilty to state charges of murder. The suspect faces state and federal charges that carry sentences of up to life in prison and the possibility of the death penalty if he is convicted.\n\nA notebook found on Mangione at the time of his arrest criticized the health insurance sector and wealthy executives.\n\nAn entry in the notebook dated Aug. 15 said: \u201cThe details are finally coming together.\u201d The entry said procrastination had allowed Mangione to learn more about the company he was targeting; the name of the company was redacted.\n\n\u201cThe target is insurance\u2026it checks every box,\u201d was also written in the notebook alleged to belong to Mangione, according to the federal complaint against him.\n\nThe notebook also references the investor conference that Thompson was set to attend.\n\n\u201cThis investor conference is a true windfall.\u201d\n\nMangione gained support from the public: negative reviews were left for the Pennsylvania McDonald's location where workers and customers recognized Mangione and called the police, leading to his arrest.\n\nPodcaster Joe Rogan covered the topic of Thompson\u2019s killing before Mangione's arrest and suggested the public wasn't as sympathetic to Thompson and UnitedHealthcare due to the \"dirty business\" in which they operate.\n\n\"Apparently, that company is really bad at denying claims,\" Rogan said.\n\nRogan said the only people crying over Thompson\u2019s death are \u201cmaybe his family, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dirty, dirty business.

            "content": "Shares of what may be America's most powerful healthcare company have declined due to controversy and regulatory threats.\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system is a behemoth -- in 2023, industrywide expenditures totaled $4.9 trillion, or $14,570 per American. UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.48%) is at the industry's center. The healthcare insurance and services giant is one of the world's largest companies, generating over $389 billion in annual revenue.\n\nRecently, UnitedHealth Group has been in the news after the CEO of the company's insurance segment was killed in New York City. The stock has declined over 15% since the tragedy in early December.\n\nU.S. healthcare can be a controversial topic. Therefore, investors must respectfully look beyond the recent events and political controversy surrounding healthcare and focus on the facts and fundamentals of the business.\n\nIs UnitedHealth Group a buy? I weighed the numbers and risks to find out. Here is what you need to know.\n\nUnitedHealth Group boasts exceptional fundamentals as a core pillar of a lucrative healthcare system\n\nHealthcare in America is a complex system with various layers. But follow the crumbs long enough, and you'll probably run into UnitedHealth Group. The company functions as two primary business units: UnitedHealthcare, one of the industry's largest health insurance companies, and Optum, which provides patient care, provider services and analytics, and prescription benefit management. In other words, UnitedHealth Group is virtually everywhere throughout the industry.\n\nThe company's sprawling size gives it leverage over its customers and a competitive edge that has fueled growth for decades. During its lifetime, the stock has turned a single $100 investment into over $447,000!\n\nFinancially, UnitedHealth Group is impressive. Its AA- credit rating is comfortably in investment-grade territory, and the business prints billions of dollars in cash flow, which it uses to pay a growing dividend (15 consecutive annual increases) and repurchase shares.\n\nDespite its size, UnitedHealth Group keeps growing. The company's management forecasts long-term annualized earnings growth of 13% to 16%. It's no wonder people have gotten remarkably wealthy by buying and holding the stock over the years.\n\nRegulatory threats could be on the horizon\n\nFor such a powerful company, its gravest threat isn't competition -- it's its regulators.\n\nHealthcare is highly political due to its importance and steadily rising costs. According to the West Health-Gallup Healthcare Affordability Index, healthcare has grown increasingly unaffordable among U.S. adults over the past few years.\n\nFinancial strain can raise the temperature of a conversation. It never justifies what happened to the UnitedHealthcare CEO or any violence. However, it has (right, wrong, or indifferent) thrust healthcare into the political spotlight during a transition to a new government administration that seems unafraid to drive change in the country.\n\nA couple of U.S. senators recently introduced the Patients Before Monopolies (PBM) Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at companies like UnitedHealth Group that own or control multiple layers of the healthcare industry. Among other things, the bill prohibits health insurers from joint ownership of both a pharmacy benefit management busness and their own pharmacy operations, so (hypothetically speaking) UnitedHealth Group would likely have to spin off its part of its Optum unit to comply if the bill became law. The bill's introduction came roughly a week after the CEO's killing, though that could be a coincidence.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time healthcare's most powerful companies faced scrutiny. Still, it is a potentially volatile time in politics that could open the door for legislation to pass that might impact UnitedHealth Group.\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nI don't think there's much debate that UnitedHealth Group is a fundamentally strong business with clear competitive advantages, growth, and profitability that have translated to outsized investment returns over time. At the same time, investors must accept the regulatory risk inherent in stocks like UnitedHealth Group. It's fair to look for a margin of safety, buying the stock at a lower price than you might otherwise, to account for the added risks of regulation.\n\nManagement recently told investors it expects the company to earn approximately $29.50 to $30 per share (non-GAAP) in 2025. That values the stock at a forward P/E ratio of 17. Based on management's forecasted earnings growth rate, the stock's PEG ratio would be 1.1 to 1.3. The PEG ratio compares a stock's valuation to the company's anticipated growth rate (a lower ratio means better value).\n\nI usually don't mind buying high-quality stocks at PEG ratios up to 2 to 2.5. UnitedHealth Group's business certainly earns that quality label. However, shares trade at a far lower PEG ratio, so I think it's a buy now. The stock seems appropriately discounted to reasonably account for potential regulatory threats, though not everyone may agree.",

            "content": "UnitedHealth Group is expected to smash financial records this year amid a fraught environment at the company following the cold-blooded murder of the insurance division\u2019s CEO, Brian Thompson, according to a report.\n\nThe health care company\u2019s CEO, Andrew Witty, has quietly been informing executives that the company will see record figures by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend \u2014 even as he works to boost morale at the company that has faced backlash following Thompson\u2019s Dec. 4 slaying in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe environment we find ourselves in is a complex one, not one that was ever designed by anybody,\u201d Witty told workers on video on Dec. 23, according to the publication.\n\nEven so, revenue at the UnitedHealth Group was more than $299 billion through September \u2014 which is a record high and up from $277 billion last year, the Journal reported.\n\n4 UnitedHealthcare, part of UnitedHealth Group, has faced backlash since the shooting of Brian Thompson. Getty Images\n\nUnitedHealth Group has been pulled into the national spotlight after 26-year-old Ivy Leaguer Luigi Mangione allegedly shot Thompson, the 50-year-old CEO of UnitedHealthcare, dead on a Midtown Manhattan street.\n\nMangione, who has denied wrongdoing, is facing state and federal charges tied to the fatal shooting. He was allegedly found with a manifesto-type document that raged against the health insurance industry.\n\nThe murder has led to some people disgustingly cheering Thompson\u2019s slaughter, or trying to rationalize it, because of his position at the insurance company.\n\nUnitedHealth Group leadership has reportedly allowed workers to stay home if they don\u2019t feel safe coming to work and armed security has been standing guard at its Minnesota headquarters, a person familiar with the company reportedly said.\n\nThe company, which has a market capitalization of about $465 billion and insures more than 50 million people, has also scoured the internet for any threatening messages, including photos of executives, another person familiar with the company told the Wall Street Journal.\n\n4 Some people have cheered Thompson\u2019s death because of his position. Business Wire\n\nSome messages have threatened workers and higher-ups, and the company has requested that news outlets blur photos of \u201cwanted posters\u201d that show executives while also requesting social media apps pull menacing posts, the newspaper reported.\n\nWitty, who took over in 2021, has tried to calm nerves throughout the frenzied past month.\n\n\u201cRight now, people continue to have strong feelings inside the organization, maybe nervous, maybe anxious, maybe worried about security,\u201d he said during the Dec. 23 video call.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from UnitedHealth Group.\n\n4 The alleged shooter, Luigi Mangione, is facing state and federal charges. AP\n\nWhile the company is raking in billions, there have been concerns that UnitedHealth and other insurers could face rising medical costs while UnitedHealth is also dealing with complaints of burnout, low wages and a company system that tosses medical procedures that should be signed off on, per the Journal.\n\nOne former worker who was there for 12 years, Inna Sarkisyan, said she \u201cadored\u201d Witty, but grew wary earlier this year about how much he actually wanted to help customers.\n\n4 The cold-blooded murder was carried out earlier this month. Obtained by NY Post\n\n\u201cHe had mentioned the quality standards, how quality affects everything,\u201d the auditor, who lost her job earlier this year, told the newspaper. \u201cHis investors, if they see a lot of mistakes, they won\u2019t trust him, and he has to make them happy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what got me, even though he was the one that used to talk about how it takes a village.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other long-term stocks.\n\nTo select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals.\n\nOn December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a \u201cbarbell\u201d approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities.\n\nIn the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year.\n\nPettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm\u2019s focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)\n\n10-Year Revenue CAGR: 11.88%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is a global healthcare company that offers health insurance plans through its UnitedHealthcare segment, and healthcare services through its OptumHealth segment. UnitedHealthcare provides health plans for individuals, employers, and government programs. OptumHealth offers health services like pharmacy care services, health information and technology, care delivery, care management, and population health management.\n\nIts key growth driver is its strategic transition to value-based care, a healthcare delivery model that prioritizes improving patient outcomes and reducing costs by incentivizing quality over quantity. This is demonstrated by the company\u2019s significant investments in OptumHealth. In 2023, OptumHealth revenues grew by over $2 billion, reaching ~$26 billion, driven by an increase in the number and type of care services offered and the patients served.\n\nPatients served by OptumHealth\u2019s value-based care models have shown improvements in key health metrics. For example, they are more likely to receive cancer screenings, have better control of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and are 10% less likely to experience emergency room visits or be readmitted to the hospital compared to patients in traditional fee-for-service models. UnitedHealth Group Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:UNH) is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving healthcare landscape and continue to deliver strong financial performance.\n\nParnassus Value Equity Fund finds an attractive investment opportunity in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), a high-quality company with strong long-term growth prospects trading at a discounted valuation. Here\u2019s what the firm stated in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe purchased two new stocks, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and Amazon. These are high-quality businesses facing temporary issues, which allowed us to purchase them at discounted valuations. The addition of UnitedHealth increases our small overweight to the Health Care sector. UnitedHealth benefits from secular tailwinds of an aging population, health care cost inflation and increasingly relevant use of heath care data/analytics. It also commands industry leadership when it comes to its extensive assets, vertical integration and deep management bench. Even though the stock has underperformed in the past year, we believe many of those factors have been priced in, positioning it well for growth in the near term.\u201d\n\nOverall UNH ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.
