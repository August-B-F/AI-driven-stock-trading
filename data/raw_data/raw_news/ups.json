A UPS provides supplemental power during high-demand periods, lowering the overall energy consumption of buildings. Moreover, its use reduces energy expenses and leads to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly construction. Moreover, UPS can contribute to the overall reliability of a building's electrical system. It can function as a buffer between the electrical system and external power sources, reducing voltage fluctuations and improving power quality. Its role also ensures that this system runs more efficiently, reducing wear and tear on equipment and increasing its lifespan. Moreover, smart inverters can maintain operation more efficiently during brief grid disturbances, particularly in areas where grid fluctuations are common. They provide real-time monitoring of system performance, power quality, and grid status, which can help both system owners and grid operators optimize performance and respond rapidly to any issues. Thus, the requirement for UPS and smart inverters is increasing in smart buildings, driving the growth of the market.\n\nFocus on Energy Efficiency in Data Centers: Data centers' higher loads necessitate the installation of larger UPS systems to support them. Energy-efficient UPS systems reduce electricity losses and may include an \"eco-mode.\" Running UPS systems in eco-mode can lower their energy expenses by up to 2%. An ENERGY STAR-certified UPS can help cut energy losses by 30\u201355% compared to a standard UPS system. For example, a 1000 kVA UPS used in a large data center could help save US$ 18,000 annually. In addition, as per the Department of Energy (DOE), a 15,000-square-foot data center operating at 100 watts per square foot requires 13,140 megawatt hours of energy yearly for IT equipment. Extending the efficiency of UPS systems supplying this much power by 90\u201395% would result in the 768,421 kWh energy reduction annually, cutting down the energy cost by almost US$ 90,000 at a rate of US$ 0.12 per kWh. Thus, the focus on energy efficiency in data centers is driving the demand for UPS and inverter systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Updated on The Latest UPS and Inverter Market Trends: https://www.theinsightpartners.com/sample/TIPRE00029487/\n\n\n\n\n\nDemand for Modular UPS Systems: Modular UPS systems have transformed the way businesses approach power supply solutions.

It's likely to be an eventful quarter for the company that could make or break the investment thesis for the stock. Here's what you need to know before investing in UPS.\n\nNear-term weakness in the economy\n\nThere's no point tiptoeing around the elephant in the room: Package delivery is a cyclical activity. When the economy catches a cold, UPS sneezes, and when it returns to full health, UPS glows. Unfortunately, several management teams at industrial and transportation companies have discussed feeling some near-term weakness.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nDelta Air Lines recently cut its first-quarter revenue guidance to about 4% from a 7%-to-9% range previously. United Airlines management recently told investors it expected earnings at the low end of its guidance range with a notable drop-off in government bookings in the quarter. Industrial company 3M's CEO, Bill Brown, told investors there had been a push-out of sales starting in March. Semiconductor test technology company Teradyne's management cut its full-year guidance on the back of order push-outs and customers taking a cautious approach and reviewing capital spending options.\n\nWhy it matters to UPS\n\nIt means a lot to UPS because package delivery is not only a cyclical activity, it's also a relatively short cycle business. That means the window between changes in demand and sales is quite small. Package delivery is short cycle and so are airline bookings, and semiconductor companies are notorious for cutting capital spending on a dime. Meanwhile, 3M's Brown specifically said the push-outs are \"certainly in the shorter cycle parts of our business.\"\n\nIt's hard not to imagine these developments are a consequence of tariff actions imposed on the economy, and UPS investors should expect some weakness in small package deliveries.\n\nTwo workers load cardboard delivery boxes into a van.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nUPS doesn't have much wiggle room\n\nIt's mainly a concern for UPS because its full-year guidance doesn't give much room for error. Going back to the last earnings call in January, UPS management's full-year guidance called for revenue of $89 billion and an adjusted operating margin of about 10.8%, implying about $9.6 billion in adjusted operating profit, which drops down into free cash flow (FCF) of \"approximately $5.7 billion, including our annual pension contribution of $1.4 billion.\"\n\nHowever, its dividend will cost $5.5 billion, and management plans to invest $1 billion in share buybacks. As such, the intended FCF doesn't fully cover its capital return aims (dividend and share buyback equaling $6.5 billion) and definitely won't cover it if UPS has to lower its full-year guidance. Indeed, management has discussed debt financing the share buyback.\n\nManagement's stated aim is to pay 50% of its earnings in dividends, but with the market penciling in $7.87 in earnings per share for 2025, a dividend per share of $6.56 represents 83% of earnings by these calculations. Adding back the $1.4 billion noncash pension expense brings the payout ratio to 69%, but it's still high, and the intended FCF barely covers the dividend.\n\nA person bites their lip and looks unsure.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMoreover, any significant weakness in the small package delivery market could disrupt at a time when UPS is intentionally reducing its level of Amazon deliveries. The plan is to lower Amazon delivery volume by 50% by the second half of 2026.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nThere's no guarantee that UPS will be negatively affected, and the weakness that others are seeing could turn out to be temporary, not least if the tariff situation is clarified. As for the long term, it's unlikely to detract from the fundamental attractiveness of investing in UPS, which includes management's ongoing journey to improve profit margins by forgoing low-margin deliveries and growing its higher-growth deliveries (notably in healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses) while investing in productivity-enhancing technology (automation, smart facilities, etc.).\n\nThese are the key reasons to buy the stock, and they will remain even if UPS decides to cut the dividend (something management previously committed not to do) or walk back its share buyback aims in 2025.\n\nThe bottom line is to buy UPS for its long-term growth prospects but not purely for its dividends because, if the current economic pressure lasts, management may need to address its dividend/buyback aims.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The twins were at odds for nearly a year, feuded at WrestleMania, and finally reunited last fall for WarGames.\n\nRather than some big event with Jimmy bailing out his brother in a dire situation, he sidled up next to Jey to face\u2026 A-Town Down Under. No fanfare, no suspense, no drama. There wasn\u2019t even a delayed entrance for Jey\u2019s mystery tag partner. Instead, Jimmy just appeared in the aisle during Jey\u2019s entrance and the two danced down to ringside.\n\nAnd then the match\u2026 woof. The brothers hit a couple of tandem spots, but the crispness and speed that defined their matches during their near-two-year reign as tag champs were gone here, replaced with a plodding that felt like they were stuck in second gear for much of the match.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s due to their opponents, but if that\u2019s the case, then blame has to be laid at the feet of the bookers. You\u2019re less than four weeks out from WrestleMania and you send a world title challenger out there to put on a dull, heatless match like that? No, you make sure the Usos are going to look electric\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get excited when WWE burns a first-time-in-nearly-two-years reunion in a meaningless tag that underperforms. They would have done better to have had Otis be the mystery partner and have both faces dance and hit their signatures to a pop.",

Like us, he\u2019s an advocate for the growth and success of small businesses that are the backbone of communities around the world.\n\nWe sat down with Kareem to get his thoughts on how we\u2019re delivering what matters for our SMB customers:\n\n\u201cI always thought UPS was really cool. It's an iconic brand, you know, from the logo to the color Brown,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's been in my view since I was a kid, so it felt really great to work with one of the world's most iconic brands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there's only a handful of brands in the world that could do this show and do it well. It was really just a fun and rewarding experience to be able to use my platform and collaborate with UPS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was really drawn to the project \u2026 Someone going about their job, dropping off packages every day for 10 years, I think that person has a lot of stories to tell and doesn't necessarily have a platform or opportunity to.\u201d\n\nThe heart of UPS\u2019s success: Nearly 30% of packages that run through our network are shipped by small and medium-sized businesses. And for these growing SMBs, trust and reliability are a big deal. Whether you need something shipped across the street or around the world, UPS has a service that will work for you, like weekend services, order fulfillment and flexible returns options.\n\nRide along with us: Kareem is tagging along with our drivers to visit small businesses that ship UPS.

On that day, United Parcel Service is projected to report earnings of $1.50 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 4.9%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $21.29 billion, indicating a 1.92% downward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $7.81 per share and a revenue of $88.36 billion, signifying shifts of +1.17% and -2.98%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service.

As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

But which one is the better value stock? Here's the lowdown.\n\nUPS and Lockheed Martin\n\nUPS looks like the cheaper stock in the long term, but Lockheed Martin is the better option in the near term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAs you can see below, UPS is cheaper if you go by price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio but more expensive on a price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) basis.\n\nThe near-term concern about UPS relates to weakness reported by several transportation and industrial companies, including 3M and United Airlines, possibly in response to uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's tariffs. If that feeds through into a slowdown in package deliveries, UPS' earnings and cash flow expectations could come under threat. Its expected earnings don't cover its $5.5 billion dividend well, so any shortfall in earnings could lead to pressure on its dividend (which yields 5.6% at Friday's closing price).\n\nIn contrast, Lockheed Martin's dividend (yielding 2.8%) is well covered by expected earnings per share (EPS), and a $176 billion backlog gives certainty around its earnings. It wins out over the near term.\n\nCompany Earnings per share 2025 (est.) P/E ratio Free cash flow 2025 (est.) P/FCF Ratio Dividends per share 2025 (est.) EPS/DPS coverage UPS $7.87 14.6 $5.7 billion 17.1 $6.56 1.2 times Lockheed Martin $27.22 16.2 $6.7 billion 15.4 $13.2 2.1 times\n\nWhy UPS wins out longer-term\n\nThinking longer term, UPS has plenty of growth prospects from focusing on healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses. Also, the plan to reduce Amazon's volume by 50% by the end of 2026 makes sense as it removes low-margin volume from its delivery base.\n\nOn the other hand, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is widely reported to want to cut the defense budget by 8% a year over the next five years. That could challenge the long-term outlook for defense companies like Lockheed Martin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and United Parcel Service wasn\u2019t one of them.

In Lebanon, Israel carried out airstrikes in retaliation for rockets fired into Israel. The strikes killed seven people , including a child, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry, and prompted fears of a \u201cnew war\u201d in the region.\n\nBut Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s biggest fight might be internal.

            "content": "In a television landscape saturated with South Asian tropes \u2014 think: dutiful doctor, tech nerd, spiritual guru, bearded terrorist \u2014 Hulu\u2019s Deli Boys arrives like a shot of spice-infused adrenaline. The Philadelphia-set series plunges viewers into the chaotic world of two pampered Pakistani American brothers who inherit their late father\u2019s, shall we say, multifaceted business: a corner deli empire that is also a helpful front for a far-reaching criminal enterprise.\n\nCreated by Abdullah Saeed, a former Vice Media producer and host of the James Beard Award-nominated series Bong App\u00e9tit, the show filters dark humor through a culturally specific lens \u2014 from Urdu dialogue speckled with profanity to drug deals conducted in traditional Pakistani shalwar kameez (long tunic and loose trousers). Poorna Jagannathan (Never Have I Ever), plays Aunt Lucky, the family\u2019s enigmatic, shrewd, and slightly unsettling matriarch. Comedian Asif Ali (The Mandalorian) and writer-actor Saagar Shaikh (Ms. Marvel), star as the feckless brothers \u2014 the younger, straight-edged, Mir and pothead party-boy Raj, respectively. Their dynamic pendulates between hilarious bickering and genuine, if begrudging, loyalty as they stumble through a series of wild misadventures: chasing a half-dead naked man around their neighborhood, befriending a Drakkar Noir-drenched corpse disposal specialist (known as \u201cmurderwala\u201d), selling cocaine bricks hidden in achaar (pickle) jars, and tracking down their father\u2019s killer \u2014 all while trying to thwart the FBI, gangsters, and so-called Paki Blinders.\n\nProduced by Onyx Collective, a division of Disney Entertainment that focuses on programming by creators of color and other underrepresented groups, it\u2019s a series that feels utterly fresh, even groundbreaking, in its simplicity. Deli Boys shows brown people as just that \u2014 brown people; nothing more, nothing less. \u201cThe fact that our story is so ordinary, and allowed to breathe without a goddamn lesson in racial identity, is what makes it extraordinary,\u201d Jagannathan says. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nThe show has won fans of all stripes, but its impact within the South Asian community is undeniable. To celebrate the series premiere, The Third Place, a South Asian-led creative powerhouse, turned the Kolkata Chai cafe in New York City into an immersive experience, drawing a massive crowd. The event\u2019s wild success \u2014 as well as the show\u2019s \u2014 demonstrates how much Deli Boys is appreciated by a community hungry for authentic representation.\n\nWith the buzz around Deli Boys continuing to build, we sat down with the leads Jagannathan, Ali, and Shaikh to unpack the show\u2019s raucous escapade, its cultural nuances, and the unexpected heart beneath the hijinks.\n\nAsif, what\u2019s a cultural misconception about the South Asian community that Deli Boys challenges?\n\nAsif Ali: That we\u2019re all sort of obedient, nice people. There is this perception, certainly through the media, where the only options are for us to play terrorists or a guy that\u2019s very meek in the background who says two lines and can\u2019t wait to be your servant. Because we have 10 episodes of our show, and you get to focus on these people in the forefront, you get to see them being pieces of shit and human beings. That alone is a step forward.\n\nPoorna, how did you consciously work to avoid perpetuating stereotypical narratives and instead offer a more nuanced portrayal of Aunt Lucky?\n\nPoorna Jagannathan: Oh, I don\u2019t think I purposely avoided anything. It\u2019s in the writing. Abdullah Saeed didn\u2019t want to write a didactic story about identity\u2026 He just wrote it for jokes. This is his sense of humor. He laughs his own ass off when he reads his own stuff in the hope that someone else finds it funny. Indeed, the three of us find it hilarious.\n\nIn order to make this work I had to lean into stereotypes. In the first scene, when the gunshot goes off, it\u2019s not written that I infantilize [Saagar and Asif\u2019s characters] and wipe the blood off their faces. But if you go deeper into the stereotype, then the humor actually lifts. For me, the funny is going way deep \u2014 I\u2019m a South Asian mother and I infantilize the shit out of my kid. Related Content\n\nI personally really related to that scene and it made me laugh.\n\nPJ: Yeah, it\u2019s something as silly as when [my character] turns around and slaps both of them \u2026 That\u2019s such a South Asian thing. I don\u2019t know how you grew up, but I grew up with efficiency being at the forefront in my school and family.\n\nAA: Abdullah originally wrote this show because he was trying to get staffed in a [writers] room. They often tell you, when you\u2019re trying to get staffed in a room, to write the craziest shit you can think of that would never be made. And so what\u2019s cool about the show is that it\u2019s one of the few shows I\u2019ve ever read about South Asian people that wasn\u2019t thought of in a situation where it was like, \u201cOK, we need to make a show about x, y, or z group and work backwards from there.\u201d It was very much like, \u201cHey, this guy [Saeed] loves Sopranos and he loves all these crazy crime and mob shows. What if we made a show like this?\u201d\n\nThese people happen to be South Asian, and then you get all of these interesting nuances, rather than having a focus meeting where the executive said, \u201cWe have to place this demographic so we need to make this type of show.\u201d This script felt like it was genuinely just an insane idea this guy came up with.\n\nSaagar Shaikh: Every South Asian person\u2019s story is different \u2014 we have completely different experiences. Even between the four of us, I\u2019m Pakistani Muslim, Asif is Indian Muslim, Poorna [whose father was an Indian diplomat] is from the whole world. We have so many different experiences that each of us as individuals got to bring to the show just by being who we are.\n\nOne thing I added to Deli Boys was in Episode Four when we were cutting cocaine in our underwear. The scene was written with us standing up at a table but I was like, \u201cI would do this in the FOB squat on the floor.\u201d It was really cool that we had that shorthand.\n\nAA: There was this open dialogue.\n\nPJ: Back to Asif\u2019s first point, when you are trying to write something and sell a script, you don\u2019t write\u2026 you start thinking about how it would work. Abdullah will tell you that everyone passed \u2014 all of the networks and all the streamers, including Hulu, passed. The very last stop was Onyx Collective, and he just knew they would pass, so at the pitch meeting he was having so much fun, and I think he went in without any expectations. He stopped caring \u2014 this script has the energy of someone who doesn\u2019t give a flying fuck. That\u2019s the beauty of it.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for Abdullah, but I think this script is from the mind of Abdullah Saeed who would get high and eat cannabis-infused food. It\u2019s so difficult to pin Deli Boys into a particular genre because it\u2019s so fluid \u2014 it\u2019s his mind without constraints or an agenda.\n\nBy the way, I was really jealous of your Asian squats, because I can\u2019t do that.\n\nSS: You gotta visit the motherland, dude.\n\nAA: You\u2019ve been in New York too long.\n\nPJ: Wait, did you not have to shit in an Indian toilet ever?!\n\nSS: [Laughs.] Let\u2019s talk about this for 10 more minutes.\n\nAA: This will be the headline: Shitting in Toilets in the Motherland and Other Things.\n\nBesides poop jokes, what\u2019s one thing you learned about each other while making Deli Boys that surprised you?\n\nAA: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been on a project where \u2014 I mean this in a nice way \u2014 everyone was equally desperate to make this thing work. There was no sense of \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d Or a \u201cI\u2019ll show up and do what\u2019s needed. I won\u2019t do anything more. Goodbye. Nice meeting you guys. We\u2019ll never text again\u201d type of vibe. It didn\u2019t feel like that.\n\nYou can\u2019t expect everyone to have the same level of desperation. But it felt like everyone understood how rare this kind of show is to get made. It really did feel like everyone was going for it. To sustain that energy all the way through three months of 14-hour days and have it go to the finish line with the same kind of energy\u2026 People left more secure jobs to come work on our show because they felt the same energy.\n\nPJ: I imagine Saturday Night Live was our set. We were unhinged. I was super surprised someone didn\u2019t walk into the room and say, \u201cPlaytime is fucking over. Buckle up.\u201d\n\nSS: We\u2019re put in the background of the industry so often and we don\u2019t get to work as much as our\u2014\n\nPJ: White counterparts.\n\nSS: Yeah, because of that we\u2019re seen as lacking experience. There\u2019s a little less trust from the producers. Without that trust, we can\u2019t show off what we are capable of doing.\n\nWhat was your initial reaction when you learned that Queer Eye\u2019s Tan France would be joining the cast as a British Pakistani South London gang leader?\n\nAA: I was so excited. What a joy to have somebody like him. I was interested to see someone who was known to make people sob and feel good and bring families together play such a piece of shit.\n\nPJ: And, also, just to let you know, we\u2019re the ones that thought of Tan France.\n\nSS: We had a secret meeting, the three of us, in the hotel conference room. We made a wishlist of our ideal cast list for guest stars and co-stars in this show. Tan France was at the top of the list.\n\nPJ: I texted him and was like, \u201cWould you be up for it?\u201d I thought he\u2019d have a small part, but they made him audition four times and they gave him a big-ass part. He was so nervous, but he\u2019ll tell you it was his most favorite thing in his whole career.\n\nAA: He did such a great job. And he\u2019s the nicest man in America.\n\nPJ: And he validated us. It\u2019s a big deal to have Tan France as part of our cast.\n\nPoorna, if you weren\u2019t an actor, what profession do you think you\u2019d thrive in, and what\u2019s one skill you have that would be surprisingly useful in that field?\n\nPJ: Oh, I\u2019ve thought about this! I would be a spy. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a spy.\n\nSS: I can totally see that.\n\nAA: You\u2019d be so good. You know five languages\u2014\n\nPJ: I know seven different languages.\n\nAA: And you have a very put-together vibe about you. People want to believe you. You have the vibe of someone who gets what they want.\n\nPJ: Love. I grew up on James Bond movies. They were the only movies we were allowed to watch.\n\nCan you share a moment on the Deli Boys set where improvisation or a spontaneous reaction created a particularly funny or memorable scene?\n\nAA: There\u2019s a moment where Poorna throws the knife at Tan, and the first time we did it, I turned around and went, \u201cDAMNNNN!\u201d Because it\u2019s an homage to Friday with Chris Tucker and Ice Cube \u2014 a classic comedy movie. And we all laughed.\n\nA lot of the time I would do things and wouldn\u2019t know if it would fit in the show. \u201cWhat if Saagar and I both did it at the same time, just like in the movie? Can we keep that in?\u201d When we got to this episode, I was so happy that it stayed in.\n\nSS: Me too!\n\nAA: If you understand the reference it becomes twice as funny.\n\nSS: People aren\u2019t talking about that moment.\n\nPJ: Isha, can you bump up that moment?\n\nYeah, maybe this article is what spreads the word.\n\nSS: There are a lot of little Easter eggs in the show. Maybe it\u2019s a slow release, people will watch it again and notice. Another thing that people aren\u2019t talking about\u2026 Cailey Breneman, our costume designer, and I worked so hard on the Super Bowl shirt. I know the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 colors are green and white, which are the same colors of the Pakistan flag. It says \u201cAmeristan\u201d on the back, but no one\u2019s talking about it.\n\nDeli Boys is awash with clever references like that, especially to The Godfather. If Deli Boys had a famous quote like \u201cLeave the gun, take the cannoli\u201d from The Godfather, what would it be?\n\nSS: I think it\u2019s a quote that Mir says: \u201cDon\u2019t ask me about my business.\u201d\n\nAA: That is from The Godfather though.\n\nPJ: Also, Abdullah\u2019s father-in-law is Albert S. Ruddy, the producer of The Godfather. So The Godfather is deeply embedded in Abdullah\u2019s veins.\n\nIf you could introduce someone to one aspect of South Asian culture through a single experience, what would it be, and why?\n\nAA: It would be food. You can explain and understand so much from food. My family is from Hyderabad in India and Saagar\u2019s family is from Hyderabad in Pakistan. Biryani would be my number one because it\u2019s so layered. I don\u2019t want anyone under 65 touching it \u2014 I need the wisdom of three generations in this biryani.\n\nPJ: My food will always be gol gappe [a popular street food in India consisting of small, crispy, hollow, fried spheres filled with potatoes and spicy, tangy water].\n\nAA: Which I can never eat in India because of the water.\n\nPJ: I mean, the diarrhea is also part of the experience. The intense pleasure and regret is part of the meal. It\u2019s like Deli Boys: pleasure and pain.\n\nWhat do you hope Deli Boys contributes to the ongoing conversation about representation, diversity, and the American experience?\n\nAA: What this show is doing is what I\u2019ve always wanted as a comedy fan when I was growing up: just placing people of different ethnicities and cultures in shows that are comedies for comedy\u2019s sake. Not heavily reliant on an explanation or plea for humanity from the audience. Any sort of step in that direction is great for any community \u2014 it normalizes and humanizes them.\n\nSS: We\u2019ve never been afforded the opportunity of being human beings with flaws and conflicted thoughts. We\u2019re written to be pigeonholed into very specific things. We\u2019re just normal people that happen to be brown.\n\nPJ: We\u2019ve never seen brown people be completely unserious. It doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s always a fucking message or teaching to be learned.\n\nAA: Ugh, \u201cLet me make you feel good about\u2026\u201d It\u2019s kind of how my Black friends feel whenever there\u2019s another slave movie: \u201cWho the fuck is this for? Why is it that every time we\u2019re nominated for an award at the Oscars it\u2019s because one of us gets whipped and that\u2019s the only way anyone feels like we deserve something.\u201d\n\nOK, last question: If your Deli Boys character had a dating app profile, what would their bio say?\n\nAA: Mir\u2019s would be: \u201cNot here for hookups, here for a long-term relationship only. If you\u2019re not interested in starting a life together, don\u2019t waste my time. And I\u2019m looking for someone with at least a graduate degree.\u201d\n\nSS: Raj\u2019s would say: \u201cNow looking for new applicants for orgy cabal, anyone can apply. 420 friendly.\u201d\n\nPJ: What does a bio need to do? Trending Stories Sean Combs Wins Dismissal of Civil Racketeering Claims in Lil Rod's Lawsuit \u2018We Are in an Emergency\u2019: Progressive TikTok Star Launches Bid to Unseat Old-Guard Dem Dropkick Murphys on Musk and Band\u2019s Deactivated Twitter Account: \u2018We Broke Up With Him First\u2019 Republicans Are Moving to Cripple the Judiciary So Trump Can Do What He Wants\n\nAA: Just a little bit of info about who you want. I feel like your character would not have any pictures on her profile because she\u2019s such a high-profile woman. \u201cSeeking discreet meet-up, message for info.\u201d\n\nPJ: Love the vibe, thank you.",

            "content": "There are only a couple of weeks left before the end of the first quarter, so it's time to consider whether UPS (UPS 0.68%) stock is a buy before the company issues its earnings results on April 29. It's likely to be an eventful quarter for the company that could make or break the investment thesis for the stock. Here's what you need to know before investing in UPS.\n\nNear-term weakness in the economy\n\nThere's no point tiptoeing around the elephant in the room: Package delivery is a cyclical activity. When the economy catches a cold, UPS sneezes, and when it returns to full health, UPS glows. Unfortunately, several management teams at industrial and transportation companies have discussed feeling some near-term weakness.\n\nDelta Air Lines recently cut its first-quarter revenue guidance to about 4% from a 7%-to-9% range previously. United Airlines management recently told investors it expected earnings at the low end of its guidance range with a notable drop-off in government bookings in the quarter. Industrial company 3M's CEO, Bill Brown, told investors there had been a push-out of sales starting in March. Semiconductor test technology company Teradyne's management cut its full-year guidance on the back of order push-outs and customers taking a cautious approach and reviewing capital spending options.\n\nWhy it matters to UPS\n\nIt means a lot to UPS because package delivery is not only a cyclical activity, it's also a relatively short cycle business. That means the window between changes in demand and sales is quite small. Package delivery is short cycle and so are airline bookings, and semiconductor companies are notorious for cutting capital spending on a dime. Meanwhile, 3M's Brown specifically said the push-outs are \"certainly in the shorter cycle parts of our business.\"\n\nIt's hard not to imagine these developments are a consequence of tariff actions imposed on the economy, and UPS investors should expect some weakness in small package deliveries.\n\nUPS doesn't have much wiggle room\n\nIt's mainly a concern for UPS because its full-year guidance doesn't give much room for error. Going back to the last earnings call in January, UPS management's full-year guidance called for revenue of $89 billion and an adjusted operating margin of about 10.8%, implying about $9.6 billion in adjusted operating profit, which drops down into free cash flow (FCF) of \"approximately $5.7 billion, including our annual pension contribution of $1.4 billion.\"\n\nHowever, its dividend will cost $5.5 billion, and management plans to invest $1 billion in share buybacks. As such, the intended FCF doesn't fully cover its capital return aims (dividend and share buyback equaling $6.5 billion) and definitely won't cover it if UPS has to lower its full-year guidance. Indeed, management has discussed debt financing the share buyback.\n\nManagement's stated aim is to pay 50% of its earnings in dividends, but with the market penciling in $7.87 in earnings per share for 2025, a dividend per share of $6.56 represents 83% of earnings by these calculations. Adding back the $1.4 billion noncash pension expense brings the payout ratio to 69%, but it's still high, and the intended FCF barely covers the dividend.\n\nMoreover, any significant weakness in the small package delivery market could disrupt at a time when UPS is intentionally reducing its level of Amazon deliveries. The plan is to lower Amazon delivery volume by 50% by the second half of 2026.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nThere's no guarantee that UPS will be negatively affected, and the weakness that others are seeing could turn out to be temporary, not least if the tariff situation is clarified. As for the long term, it's unlikely to detract from the fundamental attractiveness of investing in UPS, which includes management's ongoing journey to improve profit margins by forgoing low-margin deliveries and growing its higher-growth deliveries (notably in healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses) while investing in productivity-enhancing technology (automation, smart facilities, etc.).\n\nThese are the key reasons to buy the stock, and they will remain even if UPS decides to cut the dividend (something management previously committed not to do) or walk back its share buyback aims in 2025.\n\nThe bottom line is to buy UPS for its long-term growth prospects but not purely for its dividends because, if the current economic pressure lasts, management may need to address its dividend/buyback aims.",

            "content": "No matter how much you thought you'd love your newest Amazon purchase, there's occasionally a time when you'll need to make a return. Amazon now charges a $1 fee for returning some packages to UPS, so you may be wondering if there are other -- free -- methods to return your order. Luckily, the answer is yes.\n\nThe online retailer still offers plenty of ways to return items for free without a hassle, whether it's something small and compact or a larger item, such as a mattress. For the most part, the process is super simple, but there are some tips to keep in mind in order to make your return as seamless as possible.\n\nHow to return an Amazon package\n\nTo start a return, head to your recent orders and select the item that you want to return. Amazon will ask you why you want to return the item, then give you return options, including where to drop your package off.\n\nThen, all you need to do is grab the Amazon products you want to send back and head to the nearest drop-off location. Don't fret if you don't have the box your items came in. You can still bring your items to one of the listed locations where it will be packed up and shipped for free.\n\nIf you have all the shipping supplies you need but want the convenience of having your package picked up, you can do that, too.\n\nHere's everywhere where you can return your Amazon packages.\n\nReturn your package to Kohl's or Staples\n\nIf you live near a Kohl's or Staples store, Amazon returns are simple. When you start the return process with Amazon, select Kohl's Dropoff or Staples Dropoff as your preferred option. Amazon will send you a QR code that you'll need to bring when you head to the store (you can also show a picture of the QR code on your phone).\n\nOnce you give the Kohl's or Staples employee your return and show them the QR code, they'll pack, label and ship your items for free. Even better? Sometimes the store will give you coupons that you can use at a later date after you make your returns there.\n\nWhole Foods Market also accepts Amazon returns\n\nYou can also select Whole Foods Market as the drop-off location for your Amazon return. But you should note that if your preferred store isn't listed, your item or location may not be eligible. Also, only select stores offer no-box returns.\n\nOnce you've made your selection, Amazon will email you a QR code for a Whole Foods employee to scan. Grab that and the items you need to return, and head to either the Whole Foods customer service desk or return kiosk. An employee will take it from there and send off your package. After the return code is scanned, you will receive an email to the account linked to your Amazon that will confirm the return.\n\nHead to a Whole Foods Market to drop off your Amazon package. Jessica Dolcourt/CNET\n\nDrop your items at The UPS Store\n\nYou can also take your returns to The UPS Store. When selecting the method for returning your Amazon purchase, choose The UPS Store Dropoff. You don't need to have your items boxed or labeled. Instead, The UPS Store will pack, label and ship your return for free. UPS will email you a return shipping code ahead of time that you'll need to show to an employee. Just note that Amazon may charge a $1 fee if you choose UPS but another drop-off location was closer.\n\nHave UPS pick up your package\n\nIf your items are eligible for UPS pickup, you won't even have to leave your house to complete your return. When you start the return process on Amazon, follow the return prompts and select UPS Pick-up.\n\nIn this case, you'll need to package the items you're returning. However, UPS will provide the return label. UPS will pick up your package on the next business day, but you or another adult must be present. However, you should not that Amazon may charge you for this return option, so this is not a guaranteed free return option.\n\nAn adult needs to be present when UPS picks up your package. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nHead to a physical Amazon store\n\nIf you live near an Amazon store -- Amazon Fresh or Amazon Go -- you can drop off your return there. (Amazon has closed some of its physical stores, so finding a location may be more challenging.) On Amazon, select Amazon Store Dropoff. If the item can't be returned to an Amazon store, you'll get other return options.\n\nAmazon will send you a QR code to show to an employee at the Amazon store. You'll need to bring the items in their original manufacturer's packaging. And if you return items to Amazon Fresh Pickup or an Amazon Hub Locker location, you'll need to bring them in a box or box them up using the materials provided.\n\nWhat about DoorDash?\n\nDoorDash is testing a feature that will let you request a Dasher who can pick up your items and drop them off at a UPS, FedEx or USPS location. However, your items must already be packaged and sealed with the prepaid return label attached. The packages must be under 30 pounds each and worth less than $500. The company hasn't said when this option will be widely available; right now, it's only available in select areas.",

In prelims at the NCAA Championships swimmers qualify for one of three finals: the top eight finishers make the \u2018A\u2019 final (Ups) and places nine through 16 make the \u2018B\u2019 final (Downs). In finals, swimmers are locked into their respective final, meaning a swimmer in the \u2018B\u2019 final can only place as high as 9th or as low as 16th, even if they swim the fastest or slowest time of the event in any final.\n\nWith that in mind, we track \u201cUps\u201d and \u201cDowns\u201d after each prelims session as a way to follow the team race. Thanks to Andrew Mering for running the numbers.\n\nUps/Downs\n\nVirginia has all but locked up the team title going into the final day of the meet, putting the most swimmers into finals for the 3rd day in a row. They had a strong prelims session, ending up with six \u2018A\u2019 finalists and three \u2018B\u2019 finalists.\n\nStanford had a good morning, but maybe not the morning they needed if they are wanting to stay ahead of Texas once diving and mile points come into the picture. They were -1 from their projected score today, putting four swimmers up and no athletes down.\n\nTennessee finally had a strong prelims session, qualifying the same number of finalists as Virginia, but with three \u2018up\u2019 and four \u2018down\u2019.\n\nMichigan also had a very strong prelims session, and are looking to double their individual points in tonight\u2019s finals. Coming into today they only had 37 individual points. Today alone, they are projected to score 39, not counting miles, diving, or relays.\n\nAll 200 Back 100 Free 200 Breast 200 Fly UVA 6/3 1/1 2/1 1/1 2/0 Stanford 4/0 0/0 1/0 1/0 2/0 Tennessee 3/4 1/1 1/0 1/1 0/2 Michigan 3/1 0/0 2/0 0/1 1/0 California 2/2 1/0 0/0 1/0 0/2 Texas 2/1 0/0 0/0 0/0 2/1 NC State 2/0 2/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 Indiana 1/3 0/1 0/2 1/0 0/0 Louisville 1/3 0/0 1/2 0/0 0/1 Florida 1/2 1/1 0/0 0/0 0/1 Wisconsin 1/1 1/1 0/0 0/0 0/0 South Carolina 1/1 0/1 0/0 0/0 1/0 VT 1/0 1/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 USC 1/0 0/0 1/0 0/0 0/0 BYU 1/0 0/0 0/0 1/0 0/0 Washington St. 1/0 0/0 0/0 1/0 0/0 Duke 1/0 0/0 0/0 1/0 0/0 Ohio State 0/2 0/1 0/0 0/1 0/0 Alabama 0/2 0/0 0/1 0/1 0/0 Florida St 0/2 0/0 0/0 0/1 0/1 UNC 0/1 0/1 0/0 0/0 0/0 Ohio 0/1 0/0 0/1 0/0 0/0 Georgia 0/1 0/0 0/1 0/0 0/0 Fresno State 0/1 0/0 0/0 0/1 0/0 SIU 0/1 0/0 0/0 0/1 0/0\n\nProjected Scoring By Event\n\nAgain, this scoring does not include the mile or relays. UVA is projected to score the most individual points in every event except the 200 fly, where Texas is projected to rake in 42 points, the most of any other event.\n\nVirginia\u2019s best event this morning was the 100 freestyle, where their point projection puts them at 38.

Tennessee sits just 0.5 points ahead of Indiana in our projections due to their performance today. While Indiana generally has the edge in diving, Tennessee has a higher threshold in their sprint freestylers, coming in as the 3rd seed in the 400 freestyle relay to Indiana\u2019s 8th seed. The Vols haven\u2019t been having an amazing meet, but they seem to have turned that around slightly in prelims, so we will see how that shakes out in tonight\u2019s finals.",

            "content": "From what we can see, insiders were net buyers in ISOTeam Ltd.'s (Catalist:5WF ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nISOTeam Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nNotably, that recent purchase by Thong Huat Koh is the biggest insider purchase of ISOTeam shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that even when the share price was higher than S$0.075 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Thong Huat Koh.\n\nYou can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nSee our latest analysis for ISOTeam\n\nCatalist:5WF Insider Trading Volume March 23rd 2025\n\nISOTeam is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of under-the-radar companies with insider buying.\n\nInsider Ownership Of ISOTeam\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that ISOTeam insiders own 25% of the company, worth about S$13m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At ISOTeam Tell Us?\n\nIt's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest ISOTeam insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for ISOTeam (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.",

It's likely to be an eventful quarter for the company that could make or break the investment thesis for the stock. Here's what you need to know before investing in UPS.\n\nNear-term weakness in the economy\n\nThere's no point tiptoeing around the elephant in the room: Package delivery is a cyclical activity. When the economy catches a cold, UPS sneezes, and when it returns to full health, UPS glows. Unfortunately, several management teams at industrial and transportation companies have discussed feeling some near-term weakness.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nDelta Air Lines recently cut its first-quarter revenue guidance to about 4% from a 7%-to-9% range previously. United Airlines management recently told investors it expected earnings at the low end of its guidance range with a notable drop-off in government bookings in the quarter. Industrial company 3M's CEO, Bill Brown, told investors there had been a push-out of sales starting in March. Semiconductor test technology company Teradyne's management cut its full-year guidance on the back of order push-outs and customers taking a cautious approach and reviewing capital spending options.\n\nWhy it matters to UPS\n\nIt means a lot to UPS because package delivery is not only a cyclical activity, it's also a relatively short cycle business. That means the window between changes in demand and sales is quite small. Package delivery is short cycle and so are airline bookings, and semiconductor companies are notorious for cutting capital spending on a dime. Meanwhile, 3M's Brown specifically said the push-outs are \"certainly in the shorter cycle parts of our business.\"\n\nIt's hard not to imagine these developments are a consequence of tariff actions imposed on the economy, and UPS investors should expect some weakness in small package deliveries.\n\nUPS doesn't have much wiggle room\n\nIt's mainly a concern for UPS because its full-year guidance doesn't give much room for error. Going back to the last earnings call in January, UPS management's full-year guidance called for revenue of $89 billion and an adjusted operating margin of about 10.8%, implying about $9.6 billion in adjusted operating profit, which drops down into free cash flow (FCF) of \"approximately $5.7 billion, including our annual pension contribution of $1.4 billion.\"\n\nHowever, its dividend will cost $5.5 billion, and management plans to invest $1 billion in share buybacks. As such, the intended FCF doesn't fully cover its capital return aims (dividend and share buyback equaling $6.5 billion) and definitely won't cover it if UPS has to lower its full-year guidance. Indeed, management has discussed debt financing the share buyback.\n\nManagement's stated aim is to pay 50% of its earnings in dividends, but with the market penciling in $7.87 in earnings per share for 2025, a dividend per share of $6.56 represents 83% of earnings by these calculations. Adding back the $1.4 billion noncash pension expense brings the payout ratio to 69%, but it's still high, and the intended FCF barely covers the dividend.\n\nMoreover, any significant weakness in the small package delivery market could disrupt at a time when UPS is intentionally reducing its level of Amazon deliveries. The plan is to lower Amazon delivery volume by 50% by the second half of 2026.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nThere's no guarantee that UPS will be negatively affected, and the weakness that others are seeing could turn out to be temporary, not least if the tariff situation is clarified. As for the long term, it's unlikely to detract from the fundamental attractiveness of investing in UPS, which includes management's ongoing journey to improve profit margins by forgoing low-margin deliveries and growing its higher-growth deliveries (notably in healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses) while investing in productivity-enhancing technology (automation, smart facilities, etc.).\n\nThese are the key reasons to buy the stock, and they will remain even if UPS decides to cut the dividend (something management previously committed not to do) or walk back its share buyback aims in 2025.\n\nThe bottom line is to buy UPS for its long-term growth prospects but not purely for its dividends because, if the current economic pressure lasts, management may need to address its dividend/buyback aims.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Donald Trump expanded his retribution campaign against law firms on Friday night as he ordered his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to refer what she determines to be partisan lawsuits to the White House and recommend punitive actions that could harm the firms involved.\n\nThe directives were outlined in a sweeping memo in which Trump alleged that too many law firms were filing frivolous claims designed to cause delays. It came after a week of setbacks, in which a slew of judges issued temporary injunctions blocking the implementation of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nTrump\u2019s memo directed Bondi to seek sanctions against the firms or disciplinary actions against the lawyers. But imposing sanctions is up to federal judges, and perhaps in recognition of the uncertainty that his attorney general would prevail, Trump also ordered referrals to the White House.\n\n\u201cWhen the attorney general determines that conduct by an attorney or law firm in litigation against the federal government warrants seeking sanctions or other disciplinary action, the attorney general shall \u2026 recommend to the president \u2026 additional steps that may be taken,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe memo, as a result, created a formal mechanism for Trump to unilaterally decide whether to impose politically charged sanctions through executive orders that strip lawyers of the security clearances they need to perform their jobs or prevent them from working on federal contracts.\n\nMultiple legal experts suggested the memo would theoretically allow Bondi to decide a particular lawsuit that triggered a temporary injunction was causing an unnecessary delay, and refer the firm that filed the suit to face the effects of a punitive executive order.\n\nThat could cause a chilling effect and lead to the volume of litigation against the Trump administration to decline, the experts said. Even if the lawsuits are in fact for a legitimate purpose, there\u2019s fear that their representation could put them in the president\u2019s cross hairs and endanger their legal practices.\n\nTrump also directed Bondi to open a review into the \u201cconduct\u201d of lawyers and their respective law firms in litigation against the federal government reaching back to the start of his first term in 2017 \u2013 and recommend whether it warranted additional punitive actions.\n\nThe memo comes as Trump in recent weeks has used executive orders targeting law firms to great effect.\n\nMost recently, Trump stripped lawyers at the firm Paul Weiss of their security clearance and barred its employees from entering federal government buildings over his long-held complaint about a former partner, Mark Pomerantz, who tried to build a criminal case against him in New York.\n\nThe executive order targeting Paul Weiss was nearly identical to an order that punished the firm Perkins Coie over its ties to a lawyer who once worked with Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, and another aimed at Covington and Burling, which represented the former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nPaul Weiss had its order withdrawn on Thursday after its chair, Brad Karp, offered a series of concessions including offering up criticism of Pomerantz apparently to appease Trump. He committed to providing $40m worth of legal services to causes that Trump has championed.\n\nBut Trump has stewed for days, according to people familiar with the matter, over a series of temporary restraining orders that have slowed the implementation of his political agenda and, in one instance, branded Elon Musk\u2019s cost-cutting drive as likely unconstitutional.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That\u2019s your first argument? The idea that because my written order was pithier so it could be disregarded, that\u2019s one heck of a stretch,\u201d Boasberg said at a recent hearing.\n\nThe administration has insisted it did not violate the order, but at the heart of the dispute is the administration\u2019s belief that the judge lacked jurisdiction to hear the case in the first instance, ignoring the reality that federal courts can review whether statutes are properly invoked.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, as Trump has continued to rail against the injunction itself, the administration has adopted an increasingly combative stance towards Boasberg and said it was considering whether to invoke the rarely used state secrets privilege to stonewall the judge\u2019s inquiry.",

            "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul is pitching a slimmed-down program to give tax breaks to start-up companies, but her idea has been received with skepticism in Albany, where some critics say it\u2019s too similar to an ill-fated program started by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nCuomo\u2019s Start-Up New York program created a network of tax-free zones tied to colleges and universities. Starting in 2014, it has shielded approved businesses in designated areas from property, sales, corporate and income taxes for 10 years \u2013 and now costs the state about $17 million in revenue annually.\n\nNow that Start-Up is expiring, Hochul is proposing a narrower program called Catalist. It would start with the state\u2019s network of business incubators, which could nominate companies they\u2019ve helped to receive five years of income tax breaks. The number of participants is capped, but they could be located anywhere in the state.\n\nCatalist was internally nicknamed \u201cStart-Up Light,\u201d according to an administration source who was not authorized to discuss the name publicly. Lawmakers have also pointed out the similarities between the programs \u2013 and that\u2019s proven to be a political liability. Both houses of the Legislature omitted Hochul\u2019s idea from their budget proposals, signaling it\u2019s in trouble in negotiations over the $252 billion spending plan.\n\nAssemblymember Al Stirpe, a Democrat from Syracuse who chairs the chamber\u2019s economic development committee, said he didn\u2019t think Start-Up had much of an impact and was oversold by an extensive ad campaign. He said he would rather focus money and attention on other types of economic development incentives rather than enact Catalist.\n\n\u201cIt's an odd type of incentive compared to other incentives we give people,\u201d Stirpe said. \u201cReducing property taxes and giving them grants to fund specific things that they're going to be developing \u2013 those things seem to work fine, and we don't know why we need to have this little odd cousin on the side.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Cuomo said Start-Up New York was a game-changer that would create as many as 10,000 jobs. It created 76 jobs in its first year of operation, according to official progress reports, and 332 jobs in its second year.\n\nThe figures eventually began to increase, but still fell far short of promises: According to a database maintained by New York\u2019s economic development agency, 2024 ended with 276 companies in the program that had promised to create more than 3,000 jobs. They actually created 838.\n\nCatalist offers a more demure pitch \u2013 and officials at Empire State Development, which oversees New York\u2019s economic development programs, were quick to differentiate between the two programs. ESD President Hope Knight has pitched Catalist to chambers of commerce around the state as an important tool for early-stage companies trying to attract top talent.\n\n\u201cOur innovation companies are very important to New York,\u201d Knight said during a hearing last month. \u201cWe believe that by providing this personal income tax exemption, these companies are going to be able to hire the talent that they need and we can root them here in New York as they grow, instead of them moving someplace else.\u201d\n\nThe Start-Up program was also controversial because of how it was promoted. The state spent $45.1 million between October 2013 and October 2014 \u2013 as Cuomo ran for a second term \u2013 on television ads that encouraged businesses to apply for the program, according to a subsequent audit. ESD received more than 18,000 applications during the same period, but only about 10% were eligible for the program and just 41 enrolled, the audit found. That translated to $25,000 of advertising for each promised job.\n\nCuomo justified the ads by saying that the program \u2013 and its extensive marketing \u2013 were important for changing public perception about the business climate in the state. But over time he turned his focus to other areas. A board tasked with approving new Start-Up zones last met in 2017.\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance estimates that Start-Up now costs the state around $17 million in lost revenue each year. A state-commissioned study released in 2023 found that for every dollar expended on Start-Up, it returned $1.58 of direct tax benefits.\n\nJohn Kaehny, executive director of the government watchdog Reinvent Albany, said he was glad Start-Up NY is expiring. He said other factors, including access to the workforce, are bigger factors in business-location decisions than tax breaks.\n\n\u201cThey lost the thread on the program, and good riddance,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally, we are extremely skeptical of tax breaks.\u201d\n\nA few Start-Up zones have closed down, but some remain active \u2013 including BioLabs New York in Lower Manhattan. Several companies that utilize that incubator space told legislators that the tax breaks led them to choose New York over cities like Boston.\n\nOne is Lime Therapeutics, which is researching lipid processing and developing drugs that could one day treat cancer or cardiometabolic diseases. CEO Shardule Shah said Start-Up has made it easier to recruit employees by offering higher wages.\n\n\u201cIt became apparent to me that this would be an instrumental benefit in how we could grow the company,\u201d he said.\n\nMarc Alessi, a former state lawmaker who now leads an association of the state\u2019s business incubators, said he doesn\u2019t like that Catalist has a limit on how many businesses can participate. But he called it \u201ca logical step\u201d for helping new companies.\n\n\u201cAlthough Start-Up New York was bureaucratic and could have been a whole lot better, when done right it was effective. And we should learn from that and improve upon that, not just let them throw the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "With New York Knicks captain Jalen Brunson out for a few weeks with a sprained ankle, the pressure has fallen on the rest of the team to step up in his absence. The results have been a mediocre 2-4 in that span so far. For instance, individuals such as Karl-Anthony Towns have been carrying the offense. Mikal Bridges has also been incredibly efficient. And Mitchell Robinson is proving the Knicks brass right for having faith he\u2019d make a huge difference when healthy. On the other hand, they\u2019re fresh off their worst performance of the year in their blowout loss to the injury-ravaged Spurs. They suffered a similar fate against the Hornets Thursday, once again highlighting the team\u2019s weaknesses without their star man. Let\u2019s look at the stock ups and stock downs from the Knicks recent stretch.\n\nStock Ups and Stock Downs From Recent Knicks Stretch\n\nKnicks Stock Ups\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns\n\nThis one is easy. At times, KAT is the only player doing anything on offense for the Knicks. He carried the load against the Warriors; leading all scorers with 29 points on 12-21 shooting in their unfortunate loss. Towns also dismantled the Heat and fought a losing battle largely by himself against the Spurs finishing with 32 points\u2014his seventh straight 20-point game.\n\nMaking it all the more impressive, without a true point guard in the rotation and few natural ball-handlers, Towns is having to force his way into the paint to make things happen. Case in point, against the Spurs in the opening 20 minutes of the game, no starter other than Towns scored a bucket. Other starters were 0-20 in that span. Against the Heat, Towns scored 15 straight Knicks points in the second quarter to turn the game around.\n\nKAT\u2019s stock is definitely up in the Knicks recent stretch.\n\nMikal Bridges\n\nMikal Bridges looks far more comfortable with an increased role in the offense. At times, he\u2019s passive and lost as the third or fourth option. But, being the main scoring option besides Towns has seen Bridges stock rise, punctuated by a remarkable walk-off buzzer-beating three edging Portland in OT. He had 33 that night, beginning a solid stretch of efficient games.\n\nOne of the major factors in the turnaround is his aggressiveness getting into the paint and going to the line. Previously averaging just over a free throw per game, it\u2019s jumped to almost four per game in Brunson\u2019s absence. He\u2019s shot 17 free throws in his last five games, speaking to his increased aggressiveness. Bridges is also averaging over 60% shooting from the mid-range over that span and recently tallied an impressive .888 true shooting percentage against the Heat. His shot profile is still the same. He loves the mid-range pull up game, and he\u2019s doing it more efficiently by cutting and looking for his spots more.\n\nHis defensive minutes have also improved, being paired with Miles McBride in the backcourt as a formidable defensive duo.\n\nThe question remains, will Bridges return to being a peripheral figure when Brunson returns? It\u2019s incumbent on coaching to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nMitchell Robinson\n\nFull credit to Robinson, working his way back to full fitness, he\u2019s been phenomenal on the defensive end since returning. That provides a tantalizing glimpse of what a front court of him and Towns would look like for longer stretches with two 7-footers to contend with.\n\nPer Knicks Muse on X, the Knicks have the second-best defensive rating in the league since Robinson returned from injury. His best game by far came against the Spurs, where he put up a double-double of 13 points and 11 rebounds in just 17 minutes.\n\nKnicks Stock Downs\n\nTom Thibodeau\u2019s Lack Of Attention\n\nThibodeau\u2019s lack of attention to detail in a portion of these games is quite striking, especially in their blowout loss to the Spurs. Thibs likes his teams playing drop coverage, but there was no weak side help all night; thus, Sandro Mamukelashvili was always open at the top of the key from the pick-and-pop action. Mamu went 7-7 from three and 13-14 from the field for a ridiculous 34 points in 19 minutes\u2014the most points by a player in under 19 minutes in NBA history.\n\nWith almost all his three-pointers from the same action, it\u2019s hard to justify how that wasn\u2019t fixed by the coach.\n\nPoor shooting nights happen even for the best teams, but to play that badly against the Spurs\u2014a team playing for the draft lottery\u2014is a poor look, not to mention following it up with another blowout to the moribund Hornets.\n\nThibodeau\u2019s Rotations\n\nJosh Hart spent the Spurs post-game ominously talking about how the long road trip is wearing them down and they\u2019re struggling to create without Brunson.\n\nMikal Bridges was vocal with coach Thibodeau about his small rotations and over-using his starters. Therefore, it made sense to consider expanding his rotation. Instead, Thibs did the opposite by shortening his rotation further against the Hornets despite being severely underhanded.\n\nEven in the absence of their best player, they haven\u2019t looked to expand their rotation to include the only other natural playmaker on their roster, Tyler Kolek.\n\nKolek is a rookie and will have his ups and downs, but he led the NCAA in assists with 7.7 and was Big East Player of the Year in 2024. He particularly excels at creating for others getting downhill and finishing with his left hand. With the Knicks struggling to run basic offensive sets in the absence of Brunson and players standing around, Kolek could at least get guys better spacing. He has his defensive drawbacks, but he has to learn by getting NBA minutes. Being thrown on down 15 with 60 seconds left doesn\u2019t help anyone.\n\nThibodeau is overly stubborn, and his stock goes down as a result.\n\nPayne-ful Bench\n\nCameron Payne has yet to find a shot he doesn\u2019t like. Instead of running the offense off the bench and creating for others, he prefers to slingshot wildly all over the court. It\u2019s truly a sight to behold.\n\nAgainst Golden State, he put up a donut in ten minutes with just one assist. He also went 1-6 against the Lakers with one assist and Portland with one assist in recent Brunson-less games. He\u2019s shooting just 22% from three this month.\n\nPrecious Achiuwa has been having a nightmarish run recently off the bench. He has no blocks, no assists, one steal and 10 total points in his last six games. These are horrible numbers, and his stock has fallen massively.\n\nAs has Landry Shamet, who scored double figures just once in March. Furthermore, has no assists for the month. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s been a huge threat from outside either; shooting 3-16 from three in their last five games, 33% for the year. Shamet also managed zero\u2019s across the board in 19 minutes against the Hornets. This is unacceptable for their main scoring option off the bench.\n\nThe bench in general, apart from Robinson, is a mess. Their stock is down as it has been all year. Against the Hornets, the Knicks\u2019 bench got outscored 30-0 in three quarters.\n\nThe Knicks have to hope it won\u2019t be much longer until Brunson can return.",

People who opted into the conversation are now engaging with each other and starting to set the priorities for the deliberation. Invitations take participants into the space where they answer questions, vote in favor of comments left by others, and respond to other comments. Participation in the space is anonymous and open for a limited time.\n\n\u201cFire survivors are now actively communicating with us. And California is actively listening,\u201d said California Government Operations Secretary Nick Maduros. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the shaping of the conversation around recovery efforts from the people who are closest to the need.\u201d\n\nWhat is Engaged California?\n\nEngaged California is a new platform that gives Californians a unique opportunity to share their thoughts and connect with other people on topics that are important to them. It creates new opportunities for Californians to connect with their government to inform and shape policy through honest, respectful discussions.\n\nThe program was launched in February with the first use case focusing on the impacts of the Los Angeles wildfires. Ongoing conversations help keep policies useful and up to date by reflecting the ideas and needs of the community, rather than solely relying on one round of feedback.\n\nEngaged California represents a deep collaboration between California and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\u201cCarnegie California is grateful to be on the ground floor, providing our expertise to inform the development of California\u2019s deliberative democracy program,\u201d said Ian Klaus, Founding Director of Carnegie California. \u201cIt is wonderful that California is committed to grounding this work in best practices from knowledge partners in the state and around the globe to improve public engagement and strengthen democracy with digital tools.\u201d\n\nThis program was modeled after the successful efforts led by Audrey Tang, Taiwan\u2019s first Minister of Digital Affairs. Speaking on a panel at SXSW 2025, Tang highlighted how technology can enhance civic engagement. She pointed to California\u2019s role in leading this shift in the United States.\n\n\u201cJust a couple of weeks ago, Governor Newsom of California announced Engaged California with the same idea about plural listening on a very urgent topic\u2014of how to recover from the wildfire in Eaton and Palisades in LA, and more topics afterwards,\u201d Tang said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re now seeing a new wave grounded in individual ideas that people have, and resonance people have with each other, without AI stepping in to replace a human\u2019s role in decision making.\u201d\n\nThe long-term goal is to create a sustainable model for deliberative democracy that can be used to discuss other significant issues in California.\n\nWant to join?\n\nGetting involved is simple, and your voice can make a real impact. And remember, this isn\u2019t just a one-time input. Engaged California is a platform for ongoing dialogue where your ideas are heard and shared.\n\nStay tuned and get ready to participate.

We\u2019ll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\"\n\nHowever, the spokesman said the change would not slow delivery times for most customers anymore, as it has been rapidly expanding its fleet of EVs and other vehicles and using the Postal Service and Flex drivers.\n\nHe said, \"Amazon delivered at our fastest speeds ever for prime members globally in 2024 and delivered more than 9 billion items the same day or the next day.\"\n\nAmazon points out that more than two-thirds of its deliveries are now delivered via Amazon's own logistics network in the US, and that its last-mile network is facilitated by both delivery service partners who drive the branded Amazon vans and Amazon Flex delivery partners.\n\nFinally, the spokesman said \"Prime members worldwide also saved nearly $95 billion on fast, free delivery. In the U.S., that means Prime members saved on average over $500 on their deliveries last year.\"\n\nSee the concerns over Amazon delivery times and how the company is responding:\n\nAmazon claims UPS cutbacks won't slow delivery\n\nHow to make sure you get speedy delivery\n\nWant to be sure you get one or two-day delivery?\n\nLook for items that say \"get it tomorrow,\" which typically means they are already in an Amazon warehouse. Check delivery times for third-party vendors carefully, as many of them will not guarantee two-day shipping even to Prime members.\n\nIn the meantime, if your order is delayed, the easiest way to contact Amazon is through web chat, not calling.\n\nA chat agent may even rush it out from another seller, so you get it sooner and don't waste your money.\n\n________________________________\n\n\"Don't Waste Your Money\" is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc.

            "content": "In some ways it\u2019s a good thing, but of course there are some downsides to acting tough and putting on a mask.\n\nThe reality of life\n\nSo let\u2019s think about responding to the ups and downs. As I said, Claire Smith has helped me with these ideas. And Psalm 57 from the Old Testament is an excellent Psalm, if, you want to read it sometime or if you\u2019ve got it now. Instead of putting on a brave face as we often do, King David, who is actually the author of this psalm, actually calls a spade a spade.\n\nNow David is talked about a lot in the Bible, but he\u2019s not afraid to look at his situation, to make some statements. For example, he says, I am in the midst of lions. I lie among ravenous beasts whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. That\u2019s the sort of thing that he talks about. He\u2019s not afraid to cry out to God for help. Now society\u2019s like that, isn\u2019t it? We become self-absorbed and you know, we don\u2019t always want to hear the negative things that people want to say, but there\u2019s a downside to that because it can stand in the way of us getting to know each other and care for each other. If people are always on top, as it were, you can never really get to know that person.\n\nIf we try to keep a tight lid on everything and we say, oh, yeah, everything\u2019s fine. How are you? Oh, everything is fine. It almost sort of makes out that you don\u2019t need God, you don\u2019t need me, you don\u2019t need people. So if we\u2019re afraid to say how much we\u2019re hurting or how much we need God\u2019s help, perhaps we think, well, maybe he can\u2019t help. Maybe what can he do? Things can get beyond our own control. We admit that we\u2019re needy people. We need God. So I think it needs a little bit of a situation. Well, David, in this wonderful Psalm, Psalm 57, David\u2019s in real trouble. Someone called Saul had come after him with an army of several 1000 men. They were after him to kill him.\n\nSo David, obviously fled for protection, he fled to a cave. His enemies are in hot pursuit.\n\nWe talk in Australia about having a stiff upper lip. Well, David in this psalm actually states things as they are, as I said before, lions \u2013 teeth like spears and so on. That\u2019s how he felt. Well, of course it was real. I mean, David\u2019s life was in danger. He was frightened. He actually admitted how he felt.\n\nBut David is different to many of us because David realised that God was his only hope. Now, in this verse, in the Psalm rather, there\u2019s only 11 verses, and God is actually referred to in this short Psalm, Psalm 57- 22 times. That\u2019s quite a lot for a short psalm.\n\nHope 103.2 is proudly supported by\n\nSo this is a psalm that\u2019s not so much about David\u2019s hardship, but about the God who was able to help him through that particular difficulty. David fled to this cave to hide, but he realised that God was his ultimate refuge. He\u2019s one who helps us. He\u2019s able to give us the answers. So here he was, a king hiding in a rock cave.\n\nBut he knew without doubt that without God\u2019s help, he was helpless. So he realised, as I think we do need to realise that God is a God who is in control. There is no one greater than him. His glory, we\u2019re told in the Bible, fills heaven and earth. He sees all things. He knows all things. He\u2019s not just a remote someone up there watching from a distance. David, this king, he knew that God knew him, just today, as God knows us personally, so God is not there stuck in heaven. God is our only hope.\n\nLet\u2019s Pray\n\nWell, sometimes, dear Lord, we feel weary even before the day starts. Release us from the burdens and the worries. Help us to face life\u2019s ups and downs, knowing that you are in charge. We thank you in Jesus\u2019 name. Amen.",

Instead of rapid-fire resignations, stress from workplace disruption has evolved into a silent productivity drain known as The Great Detachment. According to Gallup, \u201cseven in ten employees (73%) say their organization has experienced some level of disruptive change in the past year. The more disruption that employees have experienced, the more likely they are to feel burned out today.\u201d\n\nEven with this growing disconnection, organizations continue to rely on the same outdated engagement strategies\u2014primarily surveys\u2014to listen to their workforce. The problem? Increasing survey frequency has done little to move the needle on actual engagement. Without meaningful follow-through on employee listening efforts, organizations risk losing top talent or paying a hefty disengagement tax as more employees adopt a mindset of doing the bare minimum.\n\nEmployees Need an Outlet\u2014But Fear Keeps Them Silent\n\nToday\u2019s workforce is carrying a massive emotional burden. Stress from workplace disruption, economic uncertainty, and shifting employer-employee dynamics have created an environment where employees have more to say than ever\u2014but don\u2019t always feel safe saying it.\n\nMany employees want to share their concerns, frustrations, and ideas, yet their experiences with traditional feedback mechanisms have left them skeptical. Surveys, AI-powered analysis, and passive listening tactics are falling short because employees don\u2019t believe their voices actually lead to change. A 2024 Seramount study found that:\n\nOnly 30% of employees believe their company acts on survey results.\n\n40% of employees don\u2019t provide feedback at all because they fear retaliation.\n\nOf those who do respond, 34% admit they aren\u2019t fully candid.\n\nThese numbers paint a troubling picture. Employees aren\u2019t disengaging because they don\u2019t have opinions\u2014but because they don\u2019t trust the system that\u2019s supposed to listen to them. When workers don\u2019t see follow-through on their feedback, many decide it\u2019s not worth it to share again in the future. Others self-censor, offering sanitized responses instead of candid comments that could lead to real improvement. Employees need to know that:\n\nTheir feedback won\u2019t disappear into a black hole.\n\nAction will be taken based on what they share.\n\nThey can speak honestly and anonymously without fear of repercussions.\n\nWhy the Status Quo Misses the Mark\n\nThe heart of the problem is a fundamental misunderstanding of what employees want from their employers. Organizations need more than surface-level data to understand individual experiences and overall workplace culture. And while engagement surveys provide valuable snapshots of employee sentiments, they rarely uncover the \u201cwhy\u201c behind the responses.\n\nThis leads HR leaders to guess at solutions, rather than implement precise, effective interventions. Even more concerning? Many HR executives admit their surveys lack a clear path to action\u2014meaning they collect data but struggle to translate it into meaningful improvements. Without a structured plan for turning insights into impact, HR leaders are left with a pile of numbers but no real change.\n\nWhen employees see that their voices drive real change, they\u2019ll invest in the company\u2019s success.Research shows that companies with high engagement levels experience:\n\n18% higher productivity\n\n23% greater profitability\n\n21% lower turnover\n\nBreaking Free from the Survey Trap\n\nOrganizations that successfully engage employees don\u2019t just listen\u2014they act. Reengaging employees requires more than just asking how they feel. It demands a holistic approach that prioritizes trust, transparency, and action. Here\u2019s how HR leaders can break free from the survey trap:\n\nRebuild Trust through Transparency: Employees must believe that their feedback is valued. Ensure confidentiality and demonstrate a commitment to acting on feedback.\n\nEmployees must believe that their feedback is valued. Ensure confidentiality and demonstrate a commitment to acting on feedback. Establish Clear Action Plans: Surveys should lead to specific, measurable actions\u2014not vague promises. Regularly update employees on what is being done in response to their concerns. If employees don\u2019t see change, they won\u2019t engage.\n\nSurveys should lead to specific, measurable actions\u2014not vague promises. Regularly update employees on what is being done in response to their concerns. If employees don\u2019t see change, they won\u2019t engage. Monitor Progress and Adapt: Continuously assess how new initiatives impact workplace sentiment and adjust as needed.\n\nHR leaders must move beyond surface-level assessments and shift toward a proactive listening model that gets to the root causes of disengagement before more of their workforce detaches or disappears altogether. Employees don\u2019t just want to be heard\u2014they want to see real, tangible action that validates their concerns. That\u2019s why forward-thinking organizations are reimagining employee listening by combining the scale of engagement surveys with the depth of focus groups\u2014giving HR leaders real diagnostic power to drive cultural change.\n\nThe time for passive listening is over. It\u2019s time to take action.",

In prelims, swimmers qualify for one of two finals heats: the top 8 finishers make the A final and places 9 through 16, the B final. In finals, swimmers are locked into their respective final, meaning a swimmer in the B heat (spots 9-16) can only place as high as 9th or as low as 16th, even if they put up the fastest or slowest time of any heat in the final.\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ll be tracking \u201cUps\u201d and \u201cDowns\u201d after each prelims session. \u201cUp\u201d refers to swimmers in the A final, and \u201cDown\u201d to swimmers in the B final.\n\nTeam Scores Through Day 1\n\nWomen (Top 10)\n\nKenyon \u2013 104 MIT \u2013 93 Denison \u2013 87 NYU \u2013 86 Emory \u2013 80 Williams \u2013 60 Hope \u2013 37 Tufts \u2013 33 Pomona-Pitzer \u2013 32 Chicago \u2013 30\n\nMen (Top 10)\n\nDenison \u2013 115 CMU/Centre \u2013 60 \u2014 Kenyon \u2013 59 Emory \u2013 58 NYU \u2013 54 Bates \u2013 49 Connecticut College \u2013 42 Calvin \u2013 39 Chicago \u2013 37\n\nWomen\u2019s Events:\n\nNYU had a very strong morning, putting 11 swimmers through to finals, seven into the \u2018A\u2019 finals.

The fee, announced earlier this month, is effective between March 16 and March 29, although UPS said the charge is \u201csubject to change.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with Customer Shipping Needs\n\nUPS wrote in the surge fee announcement that its goal is to \u201censure that we can continue to meet our customers\u2019 shipping needs without compromising the quality or timeliness of service expected from us.\u201d Supply Chain Dive, however, reports that the fee is likely in response to a flood of packages coming from the region, including smaller parcels from low-cost retailers such as Temu and SHEIN.\n\nAdded Pressure in a Tough Environment\n\nThe surge charge is just one part of the fee overhaul that UPS has implemented for 2025. Other fees include added charges for wire transfers and checks, as well as higher late fees on past-due balances. Additionally, as tariffs impact costs for foreign shipments, these added fees could result in costs that are passed down to the consumer level. Specifically, many China-based companies have taken advantage of the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, a guideline where small packages of lower-cost goods are exempt from trade duties. The Trump administration is expected to close this loophole once systems are in place to collect revenue related to tariffs.\n\nImage credit: Leena Robinson/Shutterstock",

The vote allows payment to Brown & Brown Inc. for a prorated additional insurance premium of $105,000 from March 19 through Sept. 30. Before the appraisal last year, Council approved renewing insurance from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 through Lake Mary-based Preferred Government Insurance Trust, with a $1.495 million annual premium.\n\n\u201cThe last comprehensive property appraisal of all city structures was completed in 2019 and Preferred required a comprehensive on-site property appraisal,\u201d Deputy Human Resources Director Lori McCullers wrote in a memo to Council. \u201cEvery three to seven years, Preferred requires updated values.\u201d\n\nPreferred contracted with Pittsburgh-based Centurisk to conduct an on-site appraisal of structures valued $250,000 or more and completed it in September 2024. The company has maintained Naples\u2019 historical values since 2009.\n\n\u201cThe on-site inspector determined that at some of the utility related structures, the contents were actually viewed as permanently installed equipment,\u201d McCullers said of blanket coverage, which includes buildings and contents.\n\nThe city had the option of maintaining current insurable values, but that would reduce coverage to stated-value coverage, with an 80% coinsurance clause, meaning properties must be insured for at least 80% of replacement costs to receive full coverage for a loss, or pay a penalty. Blanket coverage provides up to the sum of all assets for the insured replacement cost of any individual unit or item and pays the actual cost to rebuild \u2014 even if it\u2019s over the amount listed on the city\u2019s schedule of insured property.\n\n\u201cThis has become very important in Florida when factoring in demand and high inflation costs in the aftermath of catastrophic events,\u201d McCullers said, noting Brown & Brown recommended increasing insurable values to 17%. \u201cBlanket coverage offers the broadest coverage and eliminates the risk of additional financial loss to the city in the event of a property loss.\u201d\n\nAmong the 40 sites covered are City Hall, a 25,600-square-foot building at 735 Eighth St. S., with a $5.23 million replacement cost and $5.9 million insurable value. The adjacent 2,813-square-foot Council Chambers has a replacement cost of $595,500, with a $661,000 insurable value. Both were built in 1979.\n\nNext door, Fire Station No. 1, built in 2019, has a $7.73 million replacement cost and a $7.84 million insurable value, while Naples Police Department, 355 Riverside Circle, and the adjacent public safety building total 30,858 square feet, have a $6.76 million replacement cost and a $7.94 million insurable value.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about United Parcel Service (UPS).\n\nUPS currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.87, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.87 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy, representing 62.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for UPS\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for UPS\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for UPS here>>>\n\n\n\nThe ABR suggests buying UPS, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",

Despite this fierce competition, nine European quantum technology start-ups/SMEs were selected to receive grants.\n\nThe EIC Transition initiative aims at \u201caccelerating groundbreaking technologies from lab to market readiness\u201d. From a record 413 proposals, the recent announcement revealed 40 projects were chosen to receive roughly \u20ac2.5mil each. This included 5 grants for start-ups in the field of quantum technologies, working on the following projects:\n\nHQS-NextNMR (HQS Quantum Simulations GmbH, DE) \u2013 Next-Gen NMR Prediction and Analysis: A Cutting-Edge Tool for High-Precision Structure Identification\n\n\u2013 Next-Gen NMR Prediction and Analysis: A Cutting-Edge Tool for High-Precision Structure Identification SQELETON (Silent Waves, FR) \u2013 Scalable Qubit Readout to Resolve Superconducting Quantum Computing\u2019s Skeleton in the Closet\n\nScalable Qubit Readout to Resolve Superconducting Quantum Computing\u2019s Skeleton in the Closet Q-SPIN (ThinkQuantum SRL, IT) \u2013 Quantum system for polarization-based internet networking\n\nQuantum system for polarization-based internet networking InQubate (Delft Networks B.V., NL) \u2013 Integrated Quantum Network Node using Chip-based Qubit Devices\n\nIntegrated Quantum Network Node using Chip-based Qubit Devices PAQAAL (CubIQ B.V., NL) \u2013 Developing Photonic-Electronic Analog Application-Specific Integrated Circuits for a Quantum Secure Coherent Link\n\nThe EIC Accelerator initiative, meanwhile, supports SMEs to develop and scale up high-impact innovations, aiming for higher TRLs. Despite receive the highest ever number of submissions for an EIC Accelerator funding round \u2013 a staggering 1211 \u2013 amongst the 71 successful companies there are four quantum technology SMEs. The companies SemiQon (Finland) and eleQtron (Germany), for example, have revealed they will receive the considerable sums of \u20ac17.5mil and \u20ac12.5mil respectively.

            "content": "While pop-ups aren\u2019t a new phenomenon, they have become more sophisticated and varied in recent years. They can be as small (and mobile) as a food truck, like Haleon\u2019s pop-up that offered tote bags and hot beverages to denizens of NYC\u2019s East Village during the 2024 holiday season. Or they can rotate through different themes like The Corner at the Nordstrom NYC flagship, which hosted Bode at in March 2024 as the first of its high-profile \u201cguests.\u201d They can even show off new, high-tech products, like the LA Meta Lab dedicated to the company\u2019s AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses.\n\nRetailers also use pop-ups as testing grounds for permanent brick-and-mortar locations, as Kizik and design firm MG2 did with the retailer\u2019s NYC pop-up in 2024. The original pop-up proved so popular that Kizik extended its original operating dates while the brand planned two permanent shops \u2014 one in King of Prussia, Pa. and the other in the Mall of America. Pop-up stores also can \u201cput down roots\u201d as a permanent retail location, as Revolve Group did in January 2025 following its successful pop-up at LA\u2019s The Grove.\n\nEvent Tie-Ins Provide Fertile Ground for Pop-Ups\n\nSports and cultural events also are prime locations for pop-ups, as retail marketers seek to tap into consumer excitement and foot traffic. Savvy retailers will source or create event-specific merchandise for pop-up locations, as Saks Fifth Avenue did for the 50th anniversary of Saturday Night Live in January 2025 (the show tapes in Rockefeller Center, across the street from the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship). Saks rolled out an exclusive line of SNL merchandise via a dedicated landing page on its website as well as in two pop-up shops and a special window installation.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch likewise tied its Super Bowl LIX pop-up, held Feb. 8, 2025 in New Orleans, to products \u2014 in this case the retailer\u2019s National Football League-licensed apparel collection. Visitors could personalize their purchases at a custom embroidery station and participate in meet-and-greets with NFL stars, with additional invite-only VIP events throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a tie-in with the New York City Marathon, On Running used its pop-up shop not only to take advantage of runners\u2019 presence in the city but also to demonstrate its high-tech product manufacturing. The pop-up featured a fully automated LightSpray machine that created personalized LightSpray shoe uppers in three minutes. The single-step spraying process is designed to reduce waste, generating 75% fewer carbon emissions than the brand\u2019s other racing shoe uppers.\n\nPop-Ups Act as Brand Ambassadors\n\nSome retailers use pop-ups to signal a change in their brand positioning as well as a chance to interact with consumers in new ways. In fall 2024, H&M used a series of seven pop-ups in cities across the U.S. and Canada designed to immerse visitors in a modern, engaging space featuring \u201cthe very best of the brand\u2019s fashion identity,\u201d according to a company statement. The pop-ups featured aroma installations where guests could create personalized bottles of essential oils, with an expert walking them through each of the six base oils and potential pairings.\n\nWalmart used a pop-up that toured 40 cities to boost its fashion street cred with the Walmart Style Tour this past fall. Each stop on the tour included interactive experiences designed to position Walmart as a fashion expert, including a curated selection of #WalmartFinds, shoppable via QR codes; style tips from Walmart Style Tour stylists; free personalized color analysis to help guests find the best seasonal shades for their skin and hair tones; and personalized product giveaways.\n\nLinking Physical Pop-Ups with Digital Touch Points\n\nAnthropologie views its pop-ups as a feedback loop with its loyal customer base, reflecting and amplifying trends. For Anthropologie\u2019s Holiday House pop-up in October 2023, the retailer partnered with trend barometer Pinterest, transforming a historic Brooklyn brownstone into six curated holiday concepts and a series of events.\n\nAdditionally, the retailer\u2019s Anthro Fruit Stand pop-ups at The Grove in Los Angeles and in NYC\u2019s Union Square, linked these IRL experiences with its stores and digital presence. With the use of on-site QR codes, Anthropologie boosted category-specific DTC item sales at the installations and also facilitated customer acquisition efforts via registration for the brand\u2019s AnthroPerks loyalty program. The real-world pop-ups were amplified with a virtual Fruit Stand on the Anthropologie website.\n\nBigger is Better\n\nAnd then there are the unconventional pop-ups, some of which don\u2019t include traditional retailing opportunities but do garner attention and generate buzz. The Ikea Big Blue Bag, a 19-foot-high version of its iconic Frakta blue bag, visited several cities in June 2023. Viewers scanning QR codes located on the sculpture were offered exclusive discounts, with scans generating AR animation of Ikea products flying out of the bag before providing users with directions for claiming their offers.\n\nLevi Strauss & Co. created a pair of 501 Jeans measuring 12 feet tall, nearly five times the size of a normal pair of jeans, which toured five malls in mid-2024. Members of the retailer\u2019s Red Tab loyalty program who showed a picture of themselves with the jeans were eligible for a 40% discount off the price of a regular-sized pair of jeans.",

In prelims, swimmers qualify for one of two finals heats: the top 8 finishers make the A final and places 9 through 16, the B final. In finals, swimmers are locked into their respective final, meaning a swimmer in the B heat (spots 9-16) can only place as high as 9th or as low as 16th, even if they put up the fastest or slowest time of any heat in the final.\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ll be tracking \u201cUps\u201d and \u201cDowns\u201d after each prelims session. \u201cUp\u201d refers to swimmers in the A final, and \u201cDown\u201d to swimmers in the B final.\n\nThe Kenyon women out-swam their seeds this morning to position themselves for a title defense. The schools dominating the team race discussion have been Kenyon, MIT, and NYU, but Denison vaulted themselves into contention as well this morning. The NCAC rivals are tied with 5/2 this morning.\n\nThe NYU women have six finals swims tonight, but going 1/3 in one of their best events, the 500 free, puts a ceiling on the points they can grab. They\u2019ll need every point they can get, as they have no finalists in the 200 IM. Still, with Kaley McIntyre lowering her national record in the 50 free in prelims, the Violet should have an easy time grabbing points at the end of the session. The MIT women are in a similar boat; with no finalists in the 500 free, they will be depending on their finalists elsewhere to keep pace. Still, the Engineers have a little more room to swing as they\u2019re only the 5th fastest qualifiers in the relay.\n\nOn the men\u2019s side, Denison has nine finals swims on deck (4/5). With so many B finalists, they aren\u2019t on pace to match their projected score from the psych sheets, but by sheer numbers the Big Red look well on their way for a redemption after finishing 6th last year. In addition, diver Nick Fogle qualified for the championship final on 3-meter, which will add at minimum 11 points to their total.\n\nNYU has the second-most finals appearances tonight (3/1), though just missing out on the A final in the 400 medley might allow room for Kenyon (3/0) to slip by. Chicago had a strong individual showing (2/2), but a disqualification in the 400 medley relay prelims will sting.\n\nScore Projections\n\nNote: These projections do not include the preliminary results from men\u2019s 3-meter diving.

After countless hours of studying and practicing, his skills improved, and he developed a unique style.\n\nFast forward to today, Sean has traveled across the UK and Europe, doing what he loves most\u2014capturing the beauty of wildlife through his lens.\n\nMore info: Instagram | seanweekly.com | Facebook\n\n#1\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\nIn an interview with Bored Panda, Sean shared more about himself and his achievements.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a multi-award-winner and full-time photographer. My work is regularly featured across a range of national and international publications.\n\nAfter a career as a Royal Marine, I moved to the diverse habitats of Singapore where long-tailed macaques, snakes, lizards, and tropical birds were just a stone's throw away from my home.\n\nTraveling through Southeast Asia and Australia with my camera was what ignited my love of the natural world and now I venture across the globe to expand my wildlife photography. I have led numerous workshops in the UK and further afield in Europe at locations including, Greece, Norway, Zambia, Alaska, and Japan to name a few.\u201d\n\n#2\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#3\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\nSean often focuses a lot of his attention on Pelican, therefore we asked what he loves about photographing them.\n\nHe responded: \u201cThey are such gorgeous and majestic birds that are so prehistoric looking. Their habitat is surrounded by gorgeous snow-capped mountains making it the perfect location for any wildlife photographer.\u201d\n\n#4\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#5\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\nHe also shared the most memorable moment that he had photographed these majestic birds.\n\n\u201cThe most memorable moment was probably a few weeks ago when I was out on the lake photographing the pelicans and I was greeted by some very heavy snowfall. I have been photographing these birds for many years but never photographed them during a snowstorm.\u201d\n\n#6\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#7\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\nWe were wondering how important patience is in wildlife photography, to which Sean replied: \u201cPatience is a critical element when it comes to wildlife photography. Animals are unpredictable and can run away in the blink of an eye. In addition, the weather, lighting, and surrounding environment is constantly changing. If you want to tackle all these factors and set yourself up for success, you'll need to give yourself ample time and learn the art of patience.\u201d\n\n#8\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#9\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, wildlife photography is all about capturing the natural behavior of animals. Wild animals are unpredictable, move around frequently, and each species behaves differently. As a wildlife photographer, it is essential to wait patiently for the perfect moment to capture the ideal shot. This moment can take a few seconds, minutes, or even hours. If you're photographing a small bird, for instance, it could leave your field of view in the blink of an eye. If you're photographing a Bison, you will likely have much more time and flexibility as these animals slowly move throughout their environment. Bottom line, animals are unpredictable, and you will have to take the time to work around their behavior.\u201d\n\n#10\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#11\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\nLastly, Sean added by answering whether he hopes for people to care more about nature after seeing his images.\n\n\u201cYes, I hope my photography inspires many people of the beauty of the natural world.\u201d\n\n#12\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#13\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#14\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#15\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#16\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#17\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#18\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#19\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#20\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#21\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#22\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#23\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#24\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#25\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#26\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#27\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#28\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#29\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#30\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#31\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#32\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#33\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#34\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#35\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#36\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#37\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#38\n\nImage credits: seanweekly\n\n#39\n\nImage credits: seanweekly",

In finals, swimmers are locked into their respective final, meaning a swimmer in the \u2018B\u2019 final can only place as high as 9th or as low as 16th, even if they swim the fastest or slowest time of the event in any final.\n\nWith that in mind, we track \u201cUps\u201d, \u201cMids\u201d, and \u201cDowns\u201d after each prelims session.\n\nWomen\u2019s Meet\n\nUpdated Scores\n\nDrury \u2013 358 Nova S\u2019Eastern \u2013 353 Colorado Mesa \u2013 284 Indy \u2013 272 Lynn \u2013 174 Tampa \u2013 165 Grand Valley \u2013 158 Findlay \u2013 145 Clarion \u2013 140 Simon Fraser \u2013 137 West Florida \u2013 118.5 Augustana \u2013 114 Wingate \u2013 91 Catawba \u2013 73 Azusa Pacific \u2013 69 NMU \u2013 54 Oklahoma Christi \u2013 44 MSU Mankato \u2013 43 Wayne State \u2013 42 Delta State \u2013 42 CSU East Bay \u2013 35 UMSL \u2013 35 McKendree \u2013 33 Henderson St. \u2013 19 Southern Conn \u2013 14 Truman St. \u2013 14 West Chester University \u2013 13 Carson-Newman \u2013 12 Emmanuel \u2013 12 Hillsdale \u2013 9 Concordia \u2013 7 Florida Southern \u2013 6 Barry U \u2013 4 IUP \u2013 3 Ouachita \u2013 3 Ashland University \u2013 2.5 Davenport \u2013 2\n\nNote: We are only including teams in the table who have at least one finalist.

This is not including the mile, where Nova has a swimmer in the final and Drury does not.\n\nYesterday, Drury far outperformed their morning, and while they have little room for improvement in the 200 breaststroke, their 200 backstroker could move up her placement quite a bit, narrowing that gap for no mile swimmers.\n\nNova has a lot of space to move up, putting seven swimmers into finals in all three events.\n\nUltimately, it is very likely it will all come down to the relay and who performs the best there.\n\nTeams Total 100 Free 200 Back 200 Breast Drury 5/0 (76) 0/0 (0) 1/0 (11) 4/0 (65) Nova S\u2019eastern 4/3 (71) 2/1 (36) 1/0 (12) 1/2 (23) Colorado Mesa 2/1 (37) 0/0 (0) 2/1 (37) 0/0 (0) Indy 2/1 (32) 0/1 (4) 1/0 (14) 1/0 (14) Lynn 1/2 (23) 1/1 (21) 0/0 (0) 0/1 (2) Tampa 2/2 (36) 0/0 (0) 2/2 (36) 0/0 (0) Grand Valley 1/2 (24) 1/0 (12) 0/1 (6) 0/1 (6) Findlay 0/2 (18) 0/1 (9) 0/1 (9) 0/0 (0) Simon Fraser 1/0 (11) 1/0 (11) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) West Florida 1/0 (12) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) 1/0 (12) Augustana 1/0 (17) 1/0 (17) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) Wingate 0/1 (4) 0/0 (0) 0/1 (4) 0/0 (0) Catawba 0/3 (17) 0/1 (5) 0/0 (0) 0/2 (12) Azusa Pacific 1/0 (13) 1/0 (13) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) NMU 0/1 (2) 0/0 (0) 0/1 (2) 0/0 (0) Oklahoma Christian 1/0 (17) 0/0 (0) 1/0 (17) 0/0 (0) CSU East Bay 0/1 (3) 0/1 (3) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) Henderson State 1/0 (15) 1/0 (15) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) Truman State 0/1 (7) 0/1 (7) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) West Chester 1/0 (11) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) 1/0 (11) Florida Southern 0/1 (2) 0/1 (2) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) Barry 0/1 (1) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) 0/1 (1) IUP 0/1 (7) 0/0 (0) 0/1 (7) 0/0 (0) Jewell 0/1 (9) 0/0 (0) 0/0 (0) 0/1 (9)\n\nReal Team Scores + Projections\n\nDrury \u2013 434 Nova S\u2019eastern \u2013 324 Colorado Mesa \u2013 321 Indy \u2013 304 Lynn \u2013 197 Tampa \u2013 201 Grand Valley \u2013 182 Findlay \u2013 163 Simon Fraser \u2013 148 Clarion \u2013 140 Augustana \u2013 131 West Florida \u2013 130.5 Wingate \u2013 95 Catawba \u2013 90 Azusa Pacific \u2013 82 Oklahoma Christian \u2013 61 NMU \u2013 56 CSU East Bay \u2013 52 MSU Mankato \u2013 43 Wayne State / Delta State \u2013 42 \u2014 UMSL \u2013 35 Henderson St. \u2013 34 McKendree \u2013 33 West Chester University \u2013 24 Truman St. \u2013 21 Southern Conn \u2013 14 Carson-Newman/ Emmanuel \u2013 12 \u2014 IUP \u2013 10 Hillsdale/ Jewell \u2013 9 Florida Southern \u2013 8 Concordia \u2013 7 Barry U \u2013 5 Ouachita \u2013 3 Ashland University \u2013 2.5 Davenport \u2013 2\n\nProjected Score + Relay Score\n\nDrury / Nova S\u2019eastern \u2013 464 Colorado Mesa \u2013 355 Indy \u2013 332 Lynn \u2013 229 Tampa \u2013 215 Grand Valley \u2013 200 Simon Fraser \u2013 172 Findlay \u2013 171 Clarion \u2013 140 Augustana \u2013 131 West Florida \u2013 152.5 Wingate \u2013 121 Catawba \u2013 90 Azusa Pacific \u2013 84 CSU East Bay \u2013 64 Oklahoma Christian \u2013 61 NMU \u2013 56 Delta State \u2013 48 McKendree/MSU Mankato \u2013 43 Wayne State- 42 UMSL \u2013 39 Henderson St. \u2013 34 West Chester University \u2013 24 Truman St. \u2013 21 Southern Conn \u2013 14 Carson-Newman/ Emmanuel \u2013 12 \u2014 IUP \u2013 10 Hillsdale/ Jewell \u2013 9 Florida Southern \u2013 8 Concordia \u2013 7 Barry U \u2013 5 Ouachita \u2013 3 Ashland University \u2013 2.5 Davenport \u2013 2\n\nMen\u2019s Meet:\n\nUpdated Team Scores:\n\n\u200b\u200bDrury \u2013 390 Tampa \u2013 355 McKendree \u2013 262 Indy \u2013 239 Grand Valley \u2013 186 Florida Southern \u2013 127 Lynn \u2013 122 Colorado Mesa \u2013 119 Lewis \u2013 117 Wingate \u2013 117 St. Cloud St \u2013 109 Wayne State \u2013 85.5 NMU \u2013 82 Rollins \u2013 67.5 Catawba \u2013 66 Clarion \u2013 65 Nova S\u2019Eastern \u2013 54 Missouri S & T \u2013 51 Ouachita \u2013 49 West Chester University \u2013 29 Carson-Newman \u2013 26 Simon Fraser \u2013 25 Mines \u2013 24 Delta State \u2013 16 Quincy \u2013 16 Findlay \u2013 16 Barry U \u2013 15 Montevallo \u2013 14 Roberts Wesleyan \u2013 13 Davenport \u2013 12 Henderson St. \u2013 11 Florida Tech \u2013 9 Biola University \u2013 7 College of Staten Island \u2013 7 Saginaw Valley \u2013 4\n\nNote: We are only including teams in the table who have at least one finalist.

Deese, Jamien Scott, Mynkoda Smith and Kyland Strickland \u2014 Kelly Chavis says any of them can be a team leader on any given day. Nemo Chavis and Kenley Callahan have been key at the top of the lineup, the coach said, and R.J. Deese and Jamarion Brown have also \u201cswung the bat pretty good\u201d thus far, and Jayden Hunt is a strong baserunner and defensive player.\n\nWhile having broader goals like winning the Robeson County Slugfest or a conference championship, Kelly Chavis also says if his team meets the smallest goals then the others will take care of themselves.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to win every pitch,\u201d Kelly Chavis said. \u201cIf we win every pitch, then we feel like we\u2019re going to win every inning, win every game, and so on from there.\u201d\n\nLumberton Pirates\n\nLumberton coach Jeff McLamb says he had a \u201cheart-to-heart\u201d with his team after losing its first two games \u2014 and the Pirates (4-2, 3-0 United-8 Conference) scored 35 runs in the four games since ahead of Friday\u2019s matchup with Gray\u2019s Creek.\n\n\u201cThe kids are sort of buying in to what we\u2019re teaching at the plate, on the mound, making plays and having good pitching and getting some timely hitting,\u201d McLamb said. \u201cThe kids, they\u2019re buying into what we\u2019re teaching, back-side approach, letting the ball get deep and the whole nine yards.\u201d\n\nAt the plate, junior Brennan Griffin, sophomore Brody Stueck, senior Shaun Henderson and senior Isaac Simmons have been \u201ctearing it up,\u201d McLamb said, while seniors Austin Thorndyke and Nolan Groner, sophomore Manny Alba and freshman Jayden Graham are also impact players.\n\nSenior Landon Claar leads the pitching staff, while senior Noah Britt and sophomore Caiden Hall are also off to good starts.\n\n\u201cOur starting pitching\u2019s been solid. The first couple of games the guys coming out of the bullpen struggled a little bit, but after that they\u2019ve come in and thrown strikes and done a good job.\u201d\n\nAfter some strong starts in recent seasons that have faded in the second turn through conference play, McLamb hopes this team keeps up the momentum all the way through the campaign.\n\n\u201cI told them, we\u2019ve just got to keep working and take it one game at a time,\u201d McLamb said. \u201cAs long as we play good baseball I feel like we can compete with anybody.\u201d\n\nPurnell Swett Rams\n\nPurnell Swett entered Friday\u2019s play at 4-4 overall and 2-2 in the United-8, but having won three of its last four games.\n\nFirst-year coach Edmund Locklear says his team has adjusted well to his coaching style to start the season.\n\n\u201cI would say they\u2019ve come from more of a laid back atmosphere the last couple of years, where I would say I\u2019m a more old-school coach, I\u2019m pretty tough on them, and I think they\u2019ve responded well,\u201d Locklear said. \u201cThey\u2019re working hard, they\u2019re giving me all they\u2019ve got, and that\u2019s all I can ask for as a coach.\u201d\n\nSeniors Chandon Sanderson and Camden Hunt have provided the on-field leadership, Locklear said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always upbeat, being leaders with the team,\u201d Locklear said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask anything better out of them.\u201d\n\nA large sophomore class for the Rams features Mason Brewer, Conley Jacobs, Joseden Oxendine and Grayson Brooks, each of whom are making an impact offensively.\n\nOn the mound, Sanderson threw a one-hitter against Scotland, while Oxendine has surprised Locklear with his effectiveness.\n\nDespite two early losses in conference play, Locklear says the Rams are still among the teams with a shot at the United-8 title, with several potential contenders in a strong league.\n\n\u201cI think the conference is going to be wide open,\u201d Locklear said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking three losses, four losses could put you in first place in the conference, because it looks like we might beat up on one another.\u201d\n\nRed Springs Red Devils\n\nDespite a 3-3 record before Friday\u2019s doubleheader with Lakewood, Red Springs coach Matt Strickland feels his team has started off \u201cslow,\u201d but says that the team is capable of playing better and simply experiencing some growing pains.\n\n\u201c(We\u2019ve) got a couple of wins under our belt, but we\u2019re still a very young team,\u201d Strickland said. \u201cIt\u2019s not talent that we lack, I think we lack experience.\u201d\n\nSophomore Xzavier Sinclair has been strong both at the plate and on the mound for the Red Devils. Sophomore Terry Locklear and junior T.J. Ellerbe are among the returners that Strickland expects to make a big impact this season.\n\nFreshmen Alfredo Lowery and Jacoby Lowery have also both been strong at the plate to start off the season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a team effort right now, we\u2019re still trying to find our identity as a team,\u201d Strickland said.\n\nStrickland says he\u2019s looking for the Red Devils to be more competitive in conference play, and to do well enough in the league to earn a state-playoff bid.\n\n\u201cIn past years we\u2019ve made strides and we\u2019ve made some good leaps forward, but this year I feel like with the talent that I have, we can make even a bigger stride, we should be able to do more than we\u2019ve done in the last couple years,\u201d Strickland said. \u201cEven though we\u2019re still young, I feel like we\u2019re talented enough to make a bigger impact this year than what we\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been the head coach.\u201d\n\nSt. Pauls Bulldogs\n\nSt. Pauls coach Bladen Strickland says his team hasn\u2019t been consistent through a 2-3 start entering play Friday, but he\u2019s proud of how they\u2019ve competed thus far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more of a family this year and if we get out of our own way we\u2019re going to be a tough team to play,\u201d Strickland said.\n\nStrickland says his pitching staff, which has had five players make two or more appearances led by senior Jaden Parker, has been strong.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re night and day from what they were last year, so I\u2019m glad the developmental side for that,\u201d Strickland said.\n\nAt the plate, Strickland says his team has seen a lot of pitches and just needs to finish at-bats. Senior Josh Garner is the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the team and Jaylen Jacobs has also been strong thus far and is \u201cbecoming a great leader\u201d; Theophilus Setzer made his season debut earlier this week, and Strickland said it was a \u201cdifferent ball team\u201d with the Army football signee on the field.\n\nJuniors Cameron McNeill, Cailen McNeill and Tyler Lavoie and freshman Zayin Hunt are also key contributors for the Bulldogs.\n\nStrickland says he\u2019s eager to win the Southeastern Athletic Conference in the current league\u2019s final season before realignment, and that he wants the Bulldogs to make a playoff run.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s two (rounds), three, four, all the way to the state championship game, I want to make a run and put St. Pauls back on the map,\u201d Strickland said. \u201cPersonal goals for me is to enjoy it, enjoy the ride, don\u2019t stress about it too much.\u201d\n\nSports editor Chris Stiles can be reached at 910-816-1977 or by email at cstiles@robesonian.com.

            "content": "Insiders were net buyers of Phibro Animal Health Corporation's (NASDAQ:PAHC ) stock during the past year. That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Phibro Animal Health\n\nPhibro Animal Health Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non-Executive Director E. Corcoran bought US$111k worth of shares at a price of US$22.10 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$21.25. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. E. Corcoran was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.\n\nE. Corcoran bought a total of 10.00k shares over the year at an average price of US$21.06. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nNasdaqGM:PAHC Insider Trading Volume March 15th 2025\n\nThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. If investing in lesser known companies is your style, you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nDoes Phibro Animal Health Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Phibro Animal Health insiders own about US$416m worth of shares (which is 50% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Phibro Animal Health Insiders?\n\nIt is good to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Phibro Animal Health insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. One for the watchlist, at least! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Phibro Animal Health. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Phibro Animal Health (including 2 which can't be ignored).",

This is the first I\u2019ve heard about it, although I\u2019m sure there are many workout and exercise trends that I\u2019m not aware of. British influencer Sophia Habboo is going viral for saying on her podcast that she once did an ab workout that was so intense she climaxed! You can do that? She described it as different than your ordinary orgasm but it was definitely something. Now, experts are confirming that it really is a thing. Yes, if you do a hard enough ab workout you can Coregasm. You can see a TikTok video about it below. WARNING: there is an F-bomb.\n\nWhat Is A \u201cCoregasm?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s even a book on the Coregasm called \u201cThe Coregasm Workout\u201d and it\u2019s not just a thing that happens to women. It can happen to men too! I have a feeling this could be the great motivator to inspire many people to get up and go workout. I was going to say go to the gym but maybe that isn\u2019t the best idea if you plan on working out your abs until you Coregasm. Probably best that happens at home.\n\nCort Freeman was born and raised in Metro Detroit. He was named Clarkston High School 2009 Class Clown 13 years after graduating.

            "content": "UTEP men's basketball heats up, knocks off Sam Houston State to extend season\n\nHUNTSVILLE, Alabama \u2014 Through a losing streak that reached seven games, the UTEP men's basketball team firmly felt that if it could buy a shot and heat a little from the outside, it would bleed over everywhere.\n\nWhat was needed was a chance to test that theory. In a 79-65 victory over Sam Houston in the first round of the Conference USA tournament, which earned the Miners a quarterfinal with top-seeded Liberty Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. MT (5:30 p.m. CT), that theory held.\n\nA Miners team that spent the last month searching for the basket found it in Huntsville, Ala. They made 12-of-25 3-pointers, the most they've had since conference play began in the calendar year, and that fed over to their defense.\n\nA Sam Houston team that came in making a league-leading 40% of its 3-pointers \u2014 that's fifth nationally \u2014 made 2-of-19 3-pointers and added 13 turnovers. UTEP looked like the team that was so hot through the first part of January.\n\nQuoting UTEP coach Joe Golding\n\n\"The 3-point line was the difference in the game,\" UTEP coach Joe Golding said. \"They got wide-open looks against us a week ago (an 89-87 Bearkat win in Texas' Huntsville). Tuesday \"we made it very difficult for them on the 3-point line. We were locked in defensively. We ran towards the ball, we swiped it hard, we were talking, we were communicating. It was pleasant for me to see us on the defensive end.\"\n\nThe offense was fun, too.\n\n\"No question it makes a huge difference,\" Golding said of the 12 3s. UTEP averaged 7 3s per game this year. \"We've made some shots in this losing streak but we haven't defended. We defended (Tuesday) and we took good shots. We valued the basketball and we had great possessions.\n\n\"When you (take bad shots) you get screwed in transition. In our losing streak, we've been giving up 70 points per game, that's not us. Tonight, against a really good offensive basketball team, we hold them to 65 points.\n\n\"I thought our offense was a big reason for that. We made the extra pass, we touched paint, we got deeper in possessions. But yes, to get to 12 3-pointers is a relief.\"\n\nQuoting Sam Houston State coach Chris Mudge\n\nWhen asked if his team just got unlucky to run into someone uncommonly hot, Sam Houston coach Chris Mudge pointed out there was more to it than that.\n\n\"We seem to be the unluckiest team in America in anything that happens, that's just part of the game,\" he said. \"But in the first half we let them get comfortable with giving them some open looks and they have great players.\n\n\"When great players make a couple and get confident, then they are able to make some. That's on us and on me because we let them get going and feel good. (A prolific 3-point shooting team) is not who they are, but they stepped up.\"\n\nHow it happened\n\nAfter digging an early 13-3 hole when it made one of its first eight shots, UTEP charged in front with a 29-11 run and held Sam Houston off the rest of the way.\n\nThe Bearkats did close within 50-46 with 12:18 left. They had the momentum and were about to force a shot clock violation when Otis Frazier III danced behind the 3-point line and hit a fadeaway rainbow shot that reestablished order.\n\n\"It felt great because I was going to drive,\" said Frazier, one of five players in double figures with 12 points. \"I backed up. I looked up and didn't have time to drive, so I let it go. I had confidence in it and it went in.\"\n\nSaid Golding: \"We could breathe.\"\n\nUTEP stars of the game\n\nUTEP did this, as it will do everything going forward, without sixth-man Ahamad Bynum, who has been dismissed from the team for an undisclosed violation of team rules.\n\nCenter Kevin Kalu continued a splendid run of play with 15 points and 15 rebounds, while Corey Camper had his best game since spraining his ankle in February. He had a team-high 18 points and made 4-of-6 3-pointers. His previous UTEP high for 3-pointers was three.\n\n\"Every player on this team never put their head down, every player believed we were going to go on a run,\" Camper said. \"Make sure your brother never drops his head, especially through tough times.\"\n\nFrazier had a similar theme.\n\n\"Sticking together,\" he said. \"We stuck together all year, especially on the seven-game streak. We have joy in practice, it shows in how we played.\"\n\nBecause of that, UTEP gets at least one more game in Huntsville, Ala.\n\nUTEP women end season with competitive loss to Kennesaw State\n\nThe UTEP women's basketball team is about 75% of the way to being a solid outfit. The other 25% takes its form in one bad quarter, and that was again the story in a 71-63 loss to Kennesaw State in the first round of the CUSA tournament that ended UTEP's season.\n\nIn this game, the decisive quarter was the third, as UTEP's 36-34 halftime lead was erased under a sea of turnovers and Kennesaw State free throws. Specifically, the Owls outscored the Miners 20-11 in a period where UTEP had six turnovers, and the Owls made 11-of-16 free throws to the Miners' 3-of-4.\n\nThat added up to an eight-point hole to climb out of in the fourth quarter, and while UTEP did get within 62-58 with 4:12 remaining, they couldn't get enough layups to fall late to keep their season alive.\n\nGuard Portia Adams went out with a bang, as the junior guard finished with a season-high 24 points in her best game as a Miner. Forward Dunja Zecevic added 10 in a game where UTEP was whistled for 23 fouls and had three players (Luisa Vydrova, Irene Asensio and Ndack Mbengue) foul out.\n\nThe Miners turned the ball over 17 times. Kennesaw was 20-of-33 from the free-throw line for the game while UTEP was 7-of-9.\n\nUTEP finishes Keitha Adams' second season as head coach with an 11-19 overall record after a 4-14, 10th-place finish in CUSA.\n\nBret Bloomquist can be reached at bbloomquist@elpasotimes.com; @Bretbloomquist on X.",

The teams have already started bracing themselves for the 2026 Formula 1 Regulations (and new contenders on the field).\n\nThe 2024 Formula 1 season witnessed another masterclass of the four-time champion Max Verstappen. He became the second Red Bull driver to achieve four championships in succession (Sebastian Vettel flashbacks anyone?).

This pairing is arguably the most discussed partnership on the current grid. Hamilton is the seven-time champion and one of the legends of the grid, looking forward to redemption after his disappointing stint with Mercedes in the past three seasons.

            "content": "The demand for food delivery services has also increased dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Restaurants had to rely more on outside delivery services to stay afloat since dine-in options were shut down or severely restricted in many areas of the United States. Additionally, online grocery delivery and pickup services flourished as customers avoided going to stores. According to Bloomberg, online restaurant ordering accounted for about 40% of total restaurant sales in 2023, just over $22.4 billion in 2021, and has grown 300% faster than dine-in sales since 2014. CB Insights forecasts that the food delivery market size will grow to $320 billion by 2029.\n\nShipping and delivery times remain a key concern for customers. Recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights reveal that customers have remained committed to giving free and quick shipping top priority while placing online shopping in 2024. According to a survey of 1,013 online buyers, 81.34% of them rank free shipping as their main concern when receiving deliveries. Next in line is fast shipping, which was highlighted by 68.41% of respondents. Furthermore, 55.68% of customers stressed how important it is for merchants to maintain inventory and shipping readiness.\n\nParcelHero projects that the global delivery and courier market will reach $648 billion by 2030, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.31%, driven by improved logistics technologies and e-commerce. The market was valued at $482.9 billion in 2023, representing a 2.5% annual growth rate with a 5% growth from 2018 to 2023. The UK market is projected to reach $32 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.22% from its 2023 valuation of $20.97 billion. The transportation management systems market is anticipated to surge by 19.7% from its 2023 valuation of $13.5 billion to $33.3 billion by 2028. Innovations in technology, such as tracking, automation, and AI-powered logistics, will boost productivity and accommodate growing package volumes.\n\nThe growth of global e-commerce is linked to a surge in demand for delivery services. According to research by environmental organization Stand.earth, global e-commerce is anticipated to grow at a rate more than twice that of in-store purchases. It is anticipated that by the end of this decade, 25,000 parcels will be shipped per second. The rise in global e-commerce has also produced a change in people\u2019s shopping behaviors around the world. Online shopping accounts for about 15% of all American purchases, with an estimated yearly value of $1 trillion, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Delivery Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires . In this article, we are going to take a look at where United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) stands against the other delivery stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition, drone technology is increasingly being used across the US, with leading companies providing faster delivery services, particularly for short-distance shipments. As per McKinsey, drone delivery services are expanding, with over 800,000 paid commercial deliveries globally by 2023. According to the firm\u2019s most recent projections, the total addressable market in the United States alone is predicted to reach $5 billion by 2035, with an estimated 1.5 billion deliveries annually. Therefore, drone delivery is one of the first commercialized sectors of the larger future air mobility market, which also includes other platforms that use new aircraft, like urban and regional air mobility, as well as other commercial drone use cases, such as inspection or surveillance.\n\nEven though drone deliveries are not yet widely available, 83% of consumers in six countries who participated in a McKinsey survey were aware of them. India leads at 92% and the U.S. comes in last at 53%, with 76% of respondents saying they would be willing to switch, reflecting a 19% growth from 2021. With 35% willing to pay up to 1.5 times more, 58% of respondents are willing to pay a premium. The most preferred use case is express shipping (56% are willing to switch), which is followed by food and medical delivery. Urban residents (80%) and frequent consumers (68% prepared to pay more for food delivery) have the highest adoption potential. Finally, operators should put speed and convenience first because 20% of customers currently pay for expedited shipment, showing that there is a high demand for faster alternatives.\n\n10 Best Delivery Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires\n\nA warehouse filled with boxes of parcels, symbolizing the companies reliable logistics services.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified delivery stocks from the list. These companies are involved in logistics, shipping, and last-mile delivery services. From there, we picked the top 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaires having a stake in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on billionaire sentiment, we used the dollar value of billionaire holdings as a tiebreaker between them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)\n\nNumber of Billionaires: 14\n\nBillionaire Holdings: 956,791,484\n\nOne of the Best Delivery Stocks, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is also one of the three commercial providers that control the global small-parcel delivery market; FedEx and UPS are the two main US incumbents, and DHL Express is the market leader in Europe. In the second quarter of 2021, the firm sold off UPS Freight, its less-than-truckload division, as part of CEO Carol Tom\u00e9\u2019s \u201cbetter, not bigger\u201d strategy. Moreover, UPS sold off Coyote, its asset-light vehicle trading business that it had purchased in 2015, in September 2023.\n\nIn 2024, the firm made $91.1 billion in total revenue, $8.9 billion in operating profit, $10.1 billion in operating cash, and returned $5.9 billion to shareholders.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) sales for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $25.3 billion, up by 1.54% from the same period the previous year. It has also achieved an initial agreement with its biggest client to cut volume by more than half by the second half of 2026. Furthermore, it will assume complete ownership of its UPS SurePost product on January 1, 2025. The business is reorganizing its U.S. network and initiating multi-year \u201cefficiency reimagined\u201d projects in response to these developments to achieve a full process overhaul and save roughly $1.0 billion.\n\nRecently, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) expanded its healthcare logistics capabilities in Europe by acquiring Frigo-Trans and the related firm BPL. The acquisitions will improve UPS Healthcare\u2019s capacity to provide healthcare clients worldwide with end-to-end temperature-controlled solutions.\n\nOverall, UPS ranks 6th on our list of the Best Delivery Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for UPS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This commentary by Karen Swallow Prior was published Feb. 26 on religionnews.com.\n\n(RNS) \u2014 While one might identify any number of concerning qualities of our current cultural moment\u2014and our leaders in particular\u2014one feature that really stands out is rampant childishness.\n\nChildlike behavior among adults, especially those in positions of authority and power, is off the charts. I\u2019m not sure how measurable such a phenomenon is across time and cultures, but I can say anecdotally (and many of my peers confirm) that when I was a child half a century ago, I never saw adults engaging in the kind of childish antics so common today.\n\nLast year, The Wall Street Journal published a lengthy article asking, \u201cWhat Happens When a Whole Generation Never Grows Up?\u201d The article argues that \u201ca mix of social and economic factors\u201d has stunted the maturity of today\u2019s generations of adults under 50 and expresses the worry that \u201cwhat researchers once called a lag is starting to look more like a permanent state of arrested development.\u201d\n\nChronic childishness is one feature of such arrested development\u2014and it is everywhere.\n\nGrown adults take on the personas of comic book, video game and anime villains. World leaders hurl playground insults and cruel taunts across international platforms. Women sport hats designed to look like sex organs. The world\u2019s wealthiest and perhaps most powerful man wields a chainsaw on a national stage. The person in charge of homeland security plays with a flamethrower for clicks and kicks and giggles. One of Elon Musk\u2019s young DOGE administrators has a nickname right out of a middle school locker room. A pastor tries to portray \u201cmanliness\u201d by puffing a cigar while throwing gas around a dry field before sitting down in the middle of it while it burns. (Straight out of Beavis and Butthead, that one.) A Christian college recruits students by using the middle finger. Closer to home, a local school board member has been recently reprimanded after defacing the portrait of the outgoing superintendent but refuses to resign because it was all just a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\nWe really do need to grow up.\n\nAs the Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13:11: \u201cWhen I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.\u201d\n\nBut if we live in a culture that doesn\u2019t demand maturity of us or even teach us how to attain it, then how do we go about it?\n\nInasmuch as childishness is synonymous with foolishness, then its opposite is wisdom. The Book of Proverbs tells us that wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord. Hence, if we want to leave behind childish things, then we can begin\u2014and end\u2014by pursuing wisdom.\n\nConfucius is commonly credited with an observation that is helpful in thinking about this pursuit: \u201cBy three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.\u201d\n\nThe best (and least painful) way to attain wisdom is through reflection. We live in a time that encourages anything and everything but reflection. Reflectiveness takes time, space, and quiet. In order to have those, most of us must seek them out intentionally. Merely creating space in our lives for reflectiveness is a step toward wisdom. And given the conditions of our day, that\u2019s a bigger step than it might otherwise seem. Indeed, it might be a small step for each of us, but collectively, a giant leap for humankind.\n\nWhat we reflect on and how we reflect are big questions upon which whole books could be (and have been) written. Reading such books is one way of becoming more reflective. But it\u2019s not the only way. Journaling, talking with friends, praying\u2014anything besides offering a hot take, on the one hand, or turning completely away, on the other (both options are entirely too tempting)\u2014offer opportunities to reflect rather than react.\n\nFoolishness reacts. Wisdom reflects.\n\nWe learn wisdom also by imitation. That might sound strange if we think of wisdom as a quality that comes only with age or a trait some people possess more naturally than others. Both of these factors may be true, but it\u2019s also true that we can learn (indeed, we mainly learn) by imitation. The crux of the matter is who or what we have habituated ourselves to imitate most. The company we keep most, the entertainment we most consume, the habits we cultivate in both our work and our leisure time\u2014these are all sources of imitation. Seeking out models worthy of emulation\u2014whether actual people, or ways of thinking as laid out in books or podcasts, or (even better) holy Scriptures that are intended to tell us how we ought to live\u2014is something we can choose to do. Or not. We are surrounded by models of behavior. We get to decide which ones influence us most.\n\nExperience can confer wisdom, too, which, as Confucius points out, can be a bitter teacher. I say experience can confer wisdom because we have to be willing to receive the lessons of hard experience in order to gain the wisdom it offers. This brings us back to reflection. It\u2019s never too late to learn from mistakes (not only our own, but those of others as well). Through observation, self-examination and reflection, we can discern what has gone wrong, what we might have done wrong, and how we can do better.\n\nIn a world in which it is so easy to look out there, everywhere, on any given day or any given hour, and witness the foolishness (and, of course, worse) of others who seemingly hold so much control right now, it is easy to despair. It is easy to lament the foolishness of others rather than pursue wisdom ourselves.\n\nNotably, the words of Paul quoted above about putting away childish things occurs in the context of the famous love passage in 1 Corinthians 13. Paul has just defined love as patient, kind, humble, selfless, hopeful, and persevering. Such love is anything but childish or foolish. Such love requires and cultivates wisdom.\n\nLike love, we need wisdom more than ever right now. And as much as we might wish to see both in others, the only person each of us can cultivate either in is ourselves.\n\n(The views expressed in this opinion piece do not necessarily reflect those of RNS)",

As a reminder, you can\u2019t spot-reduce fat in your body \u2014 if you\u2019re looking to target belly fat, you\u2019ll need to focus on your diet, cardio levels, and overall fitness, rather than focusing on ab workouts alone.\n\nWhat is the workout?\n\nThe workout is 10 minutes long, and focuses on a quick warm-up, before moving onto the circuit of five exercises, that you\u2019ll repeat twice. You\u2019ll do each exercise for 45 seconds with a 15-second rest between. As always, if you need a longer rest you can press pause and catch your breath.\n\nYou can follow Wyndham-Read in real-time to ensure you\u2019re moving with good form, she gives you useful pointers along the way to help you get the most out of the workout. As with all ab workouts, think about engaging your core, sucking your belly button into your spine. Move dynamically and complete as many reps as possible to get the most out of this workout.\n\nThe nature of this seated ab workout makes it suitable for most people, however, if you\u2019re returning to exercise following an injury or pregnancy, it\u2019s always a good idea to check with a physio before taking on a new exercise routine.\n\nHere are the exercises involved:\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Here\u2019s what happened:\n\nIt was harder than expected\n\nI\u2019ll admit, I assumed any exercise that could be done sitting down probably wouldn\u2019t be all that challenging. I was completely mistaken \u2014 this workout got my heart rate up and worked my core harder than I was expecting.\n\nI found my upper body got a workout too \u2014 for the swimming arms during the cardio taps I felt my arm and back muscles engage, even though I was just using my body weight.\n\nAs a fitness editor, I\u2019ll often recommend lifting the best adjustable dumbbells or heading out for a run, but this reminded me that sometimes, simple bodyweight workouts can be just as effective.\n\nPlus, if you\u2019re unable to get any other movement into your day, chair workouts are a fantastic way to get your heart rate up between meetings.\n\nThe chair wasn\u2019t quite right\n\nWorking at Tom\u2019s Guide means we know exactly what to look for when it comes to finding the best office chair, with a decent amount of lumbar support, that makes sitting down for hours a day more comfortable.\n\nThe problem is, my office chair wasn\u2019t quite right for this workout. The arms, for example, really got in the way of the seated skipping arm and knee lifts, and the wheels on my chair meant I was a little more unstable than I\u2019d have liked during the punches section.\n\nWhile I\u2019d definitely recommend my colleague\u2019s choices when you\u2019re choosing an office chair, if you\u2019re looking to do this workout at home, you\u2019re probably better off using a chair from your dining table, or a stool like Wyndham-Read.\n\nI\u2019d recommend this workout to a friend\n\nAs a general rule, I won\u2019t recommend a workout I wouldn\u2019t send to a friend. This one gets my stamp of approval \u2014 I was able to do it from my desk between meetings, and I really felt my core and shoulders had worked afterward.\n\nI didn\u2019t get the deep, inner-core shake I\u2019d get after a Pilates session, but I didn\u2019t expect to, and was impressed with the results of this workout, considering I\u2019d done the entire thing sitting down.\n\nOf course, I didn\u2019t notice any difference in my core after just one workout. Sculpting visible abs is the result of a low body fat percentage, not just crunches and planks, but I\u2019m always looking to add more movement to my day, and this workout is one I\u2019ll repeat.",

In finals, swimmers are locked into their respective final, meaning a swimmer in the \u2018B\u2019 final can only place as high as 9th or as low as 16th, even if they swim the fastest or slowest time of the event in any final.\n\nWith that in mind, we track \u201cUps\u201d, \u201cMids\u201d, and \u201cDowns\u201d after each prelims session.\n\nWomen\u2019s Meet\n\nNote: Only includes teams with at least one finalist.

Each product featured has been vetted and chosen by our editors.\n\nAs much as I love leaving a salon feeling years younger with fresh color and a bouncy blowout, getting professional single-process hair color every six weeks is a major time and money investment. (Especially for someone whose main goal is just to cover grays.) For so long the idea of at-home hair dye to conceal my gray(ing) roots seemed too daunting, but after months of putting off a trek to the salon, I suddenly had no other option.\n\nSurprise! The traditional box dyes today are actually pretty foolproof (and admittedly life-changing). But, if roots are your major concern, you\u2019ll be left with lots of non-reusable dye. Luckily, bountiful root touch-up options exist, from creams, gels and sprays to pencils and powders. To find the best products to conceal unwanted visible roots, we narrowed down the \u201cbest of\u201d to eight. Our picks are based on how shoppers say the formulas vanish grays, stay in place, are mess-free, how long it lasts and the color match.

These surcharges will be applied to export shipments to destinations across the U.S., the rest of North and South America, Europe, Africa, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.\n\nU.S. businesses will have to pay an extra 66 cents per kilogram (29 cents per pound) for packages out of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, based on the shipment\u2019s billable weight. The fee is also subject to a fuel surcharge, UPS says.\n\nThe fees will be in effect until March 29.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to ensure that we can continue to meet our customers\u2019 shipping needs without compromising on the quality or timeliness of service expected from us,\u201d said UPS in a customer update on Monday.\n\nUPS revises its surge fees for selected shipments in response to market conditions, but a spokesperson for the company said the move is not in response to the 20 percent tariffs the U.S. has imposed on all Chinese imports.\n\n\u201cUPS\u2019s Surge Fee was introduced six months ago,\u201d the spokesperson told Sourcing Journal. \u201cThis fee helps protect the network during periods of greater demand and ensures UPS is compensated appropriately for additional costs incurred to maintain our high-quality service.\u201d\n\nSurge fees may be implemented based on regular assessments of shipping volume, available capacity and other considerations, UPS says.\n\nBased on its own discretion, the company can impose one or more surge fees on packages shipped during a peak or high demand period.\n\nThis is likely going to spur along more pricing adjustments, particularly as the future of the duty-free de minimis provision for low-value Chinese packages entering the U.S. remains uncertain.\n\nFedEx has not released comparable fees for Chinese imports thus far this year.\n\nFor UPS, this isn\u2019t the first time in recent months that a surge fee has been applied to shipments out of China, Hong Kong and Macao.\n\nThe carrier levied a heavier 50 cents per pound fee for U.S.-bound imports as of Sept. 15. At the time, UPS was dealing with escalating volumes from Shein and Temu, both of which had been flooding air cargo out of China throughout 2024.\n\nThe rise in the shipments from both companies helped deliver a massive uptick in air cargo demand into the U.S. throughout last year. But for companies like UPS, the new volume also had a side effect. Many of the packages were unprofitable, since so many of them were direct-to-consumer, low value shipments\u2014hence the additional surge fees.\n\nOn the same day UPS implemented the most recent surge fees, it also increased its fuel surcharges for its U.S. ground, SurePost and domestic air businesses by 0.5 percentage points.\n\nUPS adjusts its index-based fuel surcharges weekly based on the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s average on-highway diesel fuel price and the U.S. Gulf Coast jet fuel price average. If the national diesel fuel index\u2019s price per gallon is $3.83, a UPS ground or SurePost shipment will see a 19 percent surcharge instead of an 18.5 percent added fee.\n\nThe fuel surcharges further push up overall shipping costs. According to the Q1 TD Cowen/AFS Freight Index released in January, the extra fuel fees for both UPS and FedEx raised the average net fuel cost for ground parcel shipments by 4.7 percent sequentially into last year\u2019s fourth quarter.\n\nThose fuel costs resulted in a 3 percent increase in total costs per ground package on a sequential basis, and kept the costs relatively stable on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe extra surcharges have come on top of the general rate increases (GRIs) that have been installed by UPS and FedEx for 2025. Both couriers have added 5.9 percent GRIs as part of their annual hikes.\n\nAt the same time, the subdued demand throughout the parcel industry and a flurry of competitors in the last-mile delivery space have both caused the major players to implement more discounts to bring on more clients.\n\nWhile the first quarter is projected to see a seasonal bump on the strength of the GRIs, the 4.1 percent rate-per-package projection of the TD Cowen/AFS Express Parcel Freight Index represents a 0.4 percent year-over-year decline. The report calls it \u201cthe product of a full year of aggressive discounting.\u201d",

So that mix that we\u2019ve been building and putting in place over the last couple of years is coming to fruition, and it feels like it\u2019s at exactly the right time,\u201d CyberPower Vice President of Marketing Tim Madsen tells CRN.\n\nAs the data center spending boom rolls into 2025, CyberPower said sales of its largest modular three-phase UPS units to support those modernization efforts doubled last year, representing a massive win for its channel.\n\nShakopee, Minn.-based CyberPower said these devices are packed with enablement and sold exclusively through channel partners, which is a break from how competitors move units that size, CyberPower channel chief Peter Meisen told CRN.\n\n\u201cOur whole purpose behind this is to empower the reseller that maybe passed on these opportunities in the past because they didn\u2019t have the expertise,\u201d he told CRN. \u201cSo we put together a team of application engineers that can help these resellers find the right solution for their customer and determine exactly what\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nMeisen said the consultative approach has been working well for channel partners that are newer to the big UPS units. Once the product has been selected, the shipment is sent through distribution and CyberPower can provide boots on the ground when it\u2019s ready to be turned on.\n\n\u201cIt is highly technical, and that\u2019s why most of our competitors do it directly. But we put together this team so that any reseller should be able to do that,\u201d he told CRN. \u201cWe can turn things around pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nData center technology spending skyrocketed 34 percent in 2024 to $282 billion, according to Synergy Research Group. It soared past a half-trillion dollars in January alone, as technology vendors and investment firms vie to build out massive AI compute.\n\nCyberPower Vice President of Marketing Tim Madsen told CRN the company\u2019s product mix is being adopted throughout the tier-one and tier-two data center markets, which gravitate toward the 10-kVA and 20-kVA units, which provide thousands of watts of power to the data center in a side-by-side, stackable or rack-mounted configuration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving these 10- and 20-kVA models like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think that the mix that we\u2019ve been building and putting in place over the last couple of years is coming to fruition, and it feels like it\u2019s at exactly the right time.\u201d\n\nWhile a majority of the product growth that CyberPower sees is within the larger units, Madsen said the company recently introduced its newest 1U sine wave UPS lineup, which was a 2024 CRN Product of the Year Finalist in the Power Protection and Management category.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a lot of success with these type of small-footprint UPS systems that fit into wall-mount racks. That\u2019s another area of the business that we\u2019re doing really well in. Whether it\u2019s a security application, an audio-visual application or an edge computing situation, folks are looking for a 1U, high-density UPS that\u2019s going to power and protect those applications\u201d he said.\n\nMadsen said there will be new incentives every quarter for channel partners this year. Currently, CyberPower partners can receive an extended warranty on education and government purchases, which adds value for the cost-conscious buyer.\n\n\u201cOverall, it just lowers the total cost of ownership because the product is going to last for five years, and if it doesn't, you can turn it in and you get a new one, whether that's a new battery or a new unit or both,\u201d he told CRN. \u201cWe have the best warranties in the IT channel. With CyberPower, essentially, you get a bumper-to-bumper warranty for five years. If you are a government or an educational organization, it allows for advanced planning.\u201d\n\nAnd beginning in April, Madsen said, the smaller 1U unit will be 15 percent off for the channel.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the storms start to kick up, and then you realize you either need to replace your UPS or you need a UPS,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is kind of perfect timing for that.\u201d",

            "content": "When Carter (Nick Darnell), a 21-year-old mama\u2019s boy still living at home, gets presented with an ultimatum by his vindictive cop stepfather (Rodney J. Hobbs), he runs around town to complete a list of seemingly impossible tasks, risking his job and life.\n\nDirected, written and filmed by J Pinder, \u201cCotton Candy Bubble Gum\u201d premiered at South by Southwest on Tuesday. Complete with adventure, comedy and drama, this film takes audience members on a rollercoaster of emotions through its visual effects and dynamic storyline. Darnell\u2019s acting style proves similar to Jim Carrey\u2019s (\u201cLiar Liar\u201d), with his exaggerated facial expressions and energetic presence.\n\nThis film follows Carter as he must secure a paid promotion at his internship or find a new place to live. To land the job, his boss Jason (Ben Scattone) tasks Carter to detail his Jeep, babysit his teenage son, set up for a birthday party and recover a sex tape \u2014 all by the end of the day. Filled with chaos, laughs and heartfelt scenes, \u201cCotton Candy Bubble Gum\u201d touches on living with anxiety after Carter endures a traumatic life-altering event.\n\nThough this film is built around a thoughtful center, some of the plot gets lost in its Gen Z-esque script. In most scenes, the Gen Z slang felt too forced and often repetitive. Carter\u2019s best friend, Angel (Morgan Jay), resembles a walking Urban Dictionary after each line delivery. Though these lines proved fitting in select scenes, like when Jason\u2019s young son Nate (Jack Stone) conversed with his peers, in others, it just appeared overly cringe-inducing.\n\nOne noteworthy factor in this film is the editing style and camera work by Pinder. With a budget under $50,000 and a 12-day shoot, it should be commended how visually pleasing this film turned out. The audience felt like they were present among the characters in each scene with the camera movements. Also, at one point, Carter gets high, and the film switches to various colorful animation modes from 3D to rotoscope.\n\n\u201cCotton Candy Bubble Gum\u201d marks the feature film debut of comedian Morgan Jay, who gained popularity for his unique stand-up style where he does crowd work with an auto-tuned microphone. Jay delivers the same hilarious, chaotic energy with his character despite the chronically online script.\n\nFilled with various laugh-out-loud moments, this film balances perfectly with its particularly heavy scenes that deal with Carter\u2019s anxiety and his relationship with his mother. Carter is seen carrying around a blue fanny pack that holds dozens of cotton candy bubblegum. Throughout the film, flashback memories reveal the emotional tie he has to the bubblegum and why living at home proves so important to him.\n\n\u201cCotton Candy Bubble Gum\u201d tugs at the heartstrings of audience members. Amidst the chaos and silly storyline lies a beautiful message of letting go and growing up, even when the real world feels impossible.\n\n3 moving teddy bears out of 5",

Let's see why it underperformed the market, and if it's still worth buying today.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nA UPS truck.\n\nImage source: UPS.\n\nWhy did UPS underperform the market?\n\nUPS' average daily package volume and average revenue per piece grew in tandem in 2020 and 2021 as the pandemic drove people to buy more products online. Its profits also surged as its higher fees offset its rising operating expenses.\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Average daily package volume 21.9 million 24.7 million 25.3 million 24.3 million 22.3 million 22.4 million Average revenue per piece $10.87 $10.94 $12.32 $13.38 $13.62 $13.60 Total revenue $74.1 billion $84.6 billion $97.3 billion $100.3 billion $91 billion $91.1 billion Adjusted operating margin 11% 10.3% 13.5% 13.8% 10.9% 9.8% Diluted EPS $7.53 $8.23 $14.68 $13.20 $7.80 $6.75\n\nData source: UPS.\n\nBut in 2022 and 2023, UPS' package volumes dropped as the pandemic-driven tailwinds dissipated, inflation throttled consumer spending, and the threat of a potential strike from the Teamsters Union -- which represents roughly 333,000 UPS workers -- drove some of its customers to shift their deliveries to FedEx and other courier services. UPS tried to offset those slower shipments with price hikes, but its operating margins were still squeezed by higher labor and fuel costs.\n\nIn 2024, UPS' package volumes and total revenue rose again. That recovery was driven by the stabilizing macro environment and a new contract with the Teamsters Union to avert a strike. However, those higher labor and pension costs -- along with its divestment of Coyote Logistics, regulatory fines in the U.S. and Italy, impairment charges, and investments in its digital upgrades -- still reduced its earnings per share (EPS) by 13% on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis.\n\nWhat's next for UPS?\n\nUPS plans to automate more of its services, invest in new logistics technologies, reduce its mix of lower-margin customers, increase its mix of higher-margin enterprise customers and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and further prune its workforce. It already laid off about 12,000 employees after it secured its new Teamsters contract last year, and it aims to save $1 billion in 2025 through its new \"Efficiency Reimagined\" plan to further cut costs and streamline its business.\n\nFor 2025, it expects its revenue to dip 2% to $89 billion, with an 8.5% decline in its average daily package volume offsetting a 6% increase in its average revenue per piece. However, $1.5 billion of that revenue decline can be attributed to its divestment of Coyote. Excluding Coyote, it expects a milder decline of about 0.6%.\n\nThat mixed outlook indicates that UPS hasn't quite reached its cyclical trough yet, and it expects that slowdown to continue as it intentionally reduces its orders from its largest customer -- Amazon -- by more than 50% through 2026. That reduction will throttle UPS' near-term revenue growth, but it should boost its long-term profits, since Amazon's orders generate lower-margin revenue than its smaller customers.\n\nHowever, UPS expects its adjusted operating margin to expand to 10.8% in 2025 as its cost-cutting measures kick in. It also plans to buy back $1 billion in shares, and analysts expect its GAAP EPS to grow 16% for the full year.\n\nAt $117, UPS' stock looks cheap at 15 times that estimate. It also pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 5.6% -- which is significantly higher than the 10-year Treasury's 4.3% yield.\n\nIs it the right time to buy UPS?\n\nUPS is overcoming many of its previous challenges, and its top-line growth should stabilize once it fully laps its sale of Coyote and its reduction of Amazon's orders. Until that happens, it should keep focusing on stabilizing its operating margins, growing its earnings, and plowing its free cash flow into its ongoing dividends and buybacks. Its low valuation and high dividend yield should also limit its downside potential and make it an attractive investment in this frothy market.\n\nUPS' stock won't blast off anytime soon, but it looks like a safe place to park your cash and earn some extra income. So for now, I think it's a worthy buy for value-oriented income investors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Individuals not eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, or employer-based insurance may qualify to purchase coverage under ACA provisions. Medicaid enrollment is available year-round for those who meet eligibility requirements.\n\nWV Navigator, a federally funded nonprofit, provides free assistance in selecting a plan and applying for financial aid that helps reduce monthly premiums. Currently, 97% of Marketplace enrollees receive subsidies, making coverage more affordable. New subsidy rules have expanded eligibility, allowing even higher-income individuals to qualify for lower-cost plans. Four in five people can find plans for less than $10 per month.\n\nJeremy Smith, Program Director for WV Navigator, emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance during the enrollment process.\n\n\u201cMany people feel overwhelmed by their options or don\u2019t know how to shop for affordable health coverage,\u201d Smith said. \u201cExpanding outreach efforts has helped our program grow significantly\u2013our enrollments have increased by over 114% compared to last year. More people are realizing that these are legitimate, affordable plans.\u201d",

Demand for its services ebbs and flows with economic activity and the willingness of consumers and corporations to engage in commerce and send and receive packages.\n\nSo UPS investors don't want to see signs of waning confidence among consumers and corporates, but unfortunately, Delta Air Lines has given them some recently.\n\nDelta's management started the year expecting first-quarter revenue growth in the 7%-9% range. However, speaking at the JPMorgan Industrials event today, Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian, walked that guidance back to \"closer to 4%.\"\n\nWhile part of the decline comes down to the negative impact of a high-profile crash in Washington in January and bad weather, Bastian also noted that \"There was something going on with economic sentiment, something going on with consumer confidence\" over and above those issues.\n\nWhat it means to UPS investors\n\nThese signs of consumer/corporate caution don't read across well for UPS, and the last thing the company needs is a reduction in small package delivery demand as it navigates a deliberate reduction in Amazon.com delivery volumes.\n\nStill, it's far too early to discern whether this is a trend, and consumer/corporate confidence can return just as quickly as it goes away with more certainty around the economic environment and tariffs.",

            "content": "One Democratic senator offered an unexpected example of how he says President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs would hurt farmers and small businesses in his home state and across the country: Canadian-made aluminum pie pans.\n\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a former governor, said last week that he had spoken to farmers and bakery owners in the commonwealth who have not minced words in describing how they feel about Trump\u2019s tariffs program, which could soon include the imposition of fees on imported steel and aluminum goods.\n\n\u201cAlready, my farmers got hit so hard by tariffs in [the first Trump administration], and in an unlikely way. I mean, I had this bakery that sold mom\u2019s apple pies. They have three retail locations. They told me, \u2018We hate the tariffs.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why do you guys care about the tariffs?\u2019\u201d Kaine recalled.\n\nThe bakery owners\u2019 answer: \u201c\u2018The pie tins. \u2026 Every pie tin comes from Canada.\u2019\u201d\n\nCiting Virginia\u2019s diverse economy as an example, Kaine said the impact of the tariffs would be felt by the \u201cbiggest employer, shipyards, to a Volvo auto plant to the tiny farms and bakeries. \u2026 This thing really matters.\u201d\n\nThe United States has been a major market for Canadian aluminum and steel for some time. In 2023, the U.S. was the top export destination for Canadian aluminum products, accounting for 90.3 percent of the total value of such exports, according to Natural Resources Canada.\n\nBut in an escalation of the trade war between the longtime economic allies, Trump wrote on social media Tuesday that he would order Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to increase from 25 percent to 50 percent a tariff on Canadian-made aluminum and steel products starting Wednesday. He said the move was in response to a retaliatory action by the Canadian province of Ontario to slap a fee on electricity it supplies to several American states.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s announcement, Ontario Premier Doug Ford\u2019s office said the provincial leader would be meeting with Lutnick in Washington on Thursday and that Ontario had \u201cagreed to suspend its 25 per cent surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\u201d\n\nU.S. and global stock markets have in recent days taken a sour view of the tariffs pushed by Trump, who declined to rule out an economic recession during a Fox News interview that aired Sunday. The import fees even prompted one report warning of higher auto insurance costs, linked to the higher price of Canadian- and Mexican-made vehicle parts.\n\nAmerican markets \u2014 including the widely followed S&P 500, Dow Jones index and NASDAQ \u2014 were all down sharply by the end of Monday trading. At press time, all were in the red during ongoing Tuesday trading. Appearing with Elon Musk at the White House on Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the \u201cmarkets are going to go up and they\u2019re going to go down, but, you know what, we have to rebuild our country.\u201d\n\nThe markets\u2019 tumble prompted warnings from congressional Democrats, urging Trump to pump the brakes.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump knows his tariffs could wreck the economy, but he\u2019s doing it anyway,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday. \u201cAll so he can use the income from tariffs to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d\n\nHawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, a member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, wrote Monday on social media: \u201cMarkets don\u2019t like monarchs who lack impulse control.\u201d\n\nFlorida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a former Democratic National Committee chair, wrote on social media that the U.S. was \u201cheaded into a recession\u201d and that \u201cTrump\u2019s chaos just makes the high prices and job fears worse.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with Fox News that aired Sunday, Trump was asked by anchor Maria Bartiromo whether he expected a recession this year.\n\n\u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing. And there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,\u201d the president said.\n\nAsked later Sunday on Air Force One about his unwillingness to rule out a recession, Trump told reporters, \u201cI tell you what, of course, you hesitate. Who knows?\u201d\n\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine, pictured here speaking at a gathering near the Capitol on Feb. 5, has criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on many Canadian-made items. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo)\n\nMeanwhile, Lutnick said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that there would be \u201cno recession in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring manufacturing back, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going,\u201d he said. \u201cWill there be distortions? Of course. Foreign goods may get a little more expensive, but American goods are going to get cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u2018Pretty pumped\u2019\n\nBut without competition from foreign-made goods, it was not clear what would keep the prices of American-produced items affordable. What was more clear was Trump\u2019s intention to overhaul the U.S. economy, which many economists have said he inherited in fundamentally strong shape from former President Joe Biden, to make it more closed-off and self-sufficient.\n\n\u201cWhat I have to do is build a strong country. You can\u2019t really watch the stock market. If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. \u2026 We go by quarters,\u201d Trump told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t go by that. You have to do what\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re building a tremendous foundation for the future, tremendous foundation. Everything\u2019s been taken away,\u201d he added, referring to his vow to bring manufacturing facilities and jobs back from other countries.\n\nWhite House officials this week have largely brushed off reports of the stock markets\u2019 sharp downturn.\n\nOne official said in an email that he wanted to \u201cemphasize that we\u2019re seeing a strong divergence between animal spirits of the stock market and what we\u2019re actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders.\u201d\n\nThe Trump official contended that \u201cthe latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what\u2019s in store for the economy in the medium to long term.\u201d\n\nAs the markets have dipped, many Republican lawmakers have stood by Trump \u2014 who remains wildly popular with the party base.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, while he gave that honest answer, remember what he said: To me, that key word was \u2018transition.\u2019 \u2026 As awful as the last two years were and the last four years were, these are really decades of problems that have stacked up,\u201d North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer, whose state backed Trump by 37 points last fall, told Fox Business on Monday.\n\n\u201cOne president has come along and said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to right this ship. We cannot continue to do what generations of presidents and Congresses have done. And it\u2019s going to take some dramatic action, and it\u2019s what the American people signed up for,\u201d Cramer contended. \u201cThat\u2019s why they voted for him. And secondly, he\u2019s doing exactly what he said he would do, and they\u2019re still for him. The polling even today still supports Donald Trump. And maybe on Wall Street they\u2019re a little uptight for now. But on Main Street, they\u2019re pretty pumped.\u201d\n\nYet, a March 8-10 Emerson College survey conducted around Trump\u2019s 50th day back in office found his approval rating had slipped to 47 percent with disapproval of the president rising to 45 percent. The president began his term with a net approval rating of 49 percent to 41 percent, according to Emerson polling from late January.\n\n\u201cDespite not yet delivering on the economy in voters\u2019 minds, Trump\u2019s support remains strong. However, the true challenge will be how voters perceive their financial future. While little has shifted since the election, the initial \u2018honeymoon phase\u2019 seems to be coming to an end,\u201d Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cVoters are most supportive of Trump\u2019s immigration policy,\u201d Kimball added, \u201cBut they disapprove of his handling of the economy, believe tariffs will hurt economic growth, and are skeptical of his cryptocurrency policy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s top spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, defended her boss on Tuesday, saying his vision is to build a \u201cmanufacturing superpower\u201d with \u201cthriving industries again.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump will not repeat the trend of past American presidents who broke their promises to the American public,\u201d she said during a White House press briefing, \u201cand smiled while they stuck a knife in the back of American workers and shipped their jobs overseas.\n\n\u201cWe are in a period of transition from the mess that was created under Joe Biden and the previous administration,\u201d she added, \u201cinto a Golden Age of American manufacturing under a businessman and a dealmaker-in-chief in President Donald J. Trump, who will be implementing, is implementing the formula that we know works.\u201d\n\nDavid Jordan contributed to this report.",

Following industry and market expansion, these studies highlight the increasingly critical role of UPS systems\u2019 resilience in critical digital infrastructure design.\n\nAs these infrastructures become increasingly integral to everyday functions, the reliability of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems cannot be understated. Designing for reliability (DFR) is a cornerstone in maintaining uptime, offering a comprehensive approach to creating resilient and efficient UPS systems.\n\nOur newest insights paper, \u201cEnabling Uninterrupted Power: Design for Reliability in UPS Systems,\u201d delves into the basic principles of DFR and its application in UPS systems design, underscoring its operational and technical significance for data center operators and IT engineers.\n\nUnderstanding design for reliability (DFR)\n\nDFR is an engineering approach that integrates reliability into every stage of product development, from conceptualization to lifecycle management and obsolescence. It is a series of procedures and tests on products, applications, and processes that happen from the planning and design stages to the development stage of a project development cycle. DFR is meant to examine a project's performance and functions within specific or extreme environments and situations over an identified and expected lifecycle duration for:\n\nCohesion and integrability with systems\n\nReliability\n\nOptimization (as an extended, forward-thinking consideration)\n\nFrom an operational perspective, considering reliability from the outset tends to be more cost-efficient than testing for reliability post-implementation. Concurrent engineering practiced in DFR enables engineering teams to come together and collaborate on the anticipated concerns from various viewpoints, removing engineering silos that can cause problems expected to be overlooked: power requirements, limitations for assembly, restrictions in manufacturing, supply chain constraints, environmental considerations, failure-inducing loads, and causes of premature deterioration are just some of the concerns that different teams will have to operationalize during development.\n\nBy coming together during the design through prototyping and testing stages, teams can have benchmark data and insights during the product development process for reliability, reduce and optimize development and deployment times, and enable systems, components, programs, and procedures that can be duplicated and standardized.",

It\u2019s anonymous!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nMy fianc\u00e9, \u201cAnthony,\u201d and I had been working at the same company but in different divisions for four years, dating for three and living together for 18 months when \u201cLyla\u201d got hired for a cross-cutting role that made her kind of my boss\u2019s boss with some visibility into Anthony\u2019s department. We were both super excited when the announcement was made: I work in a mostly female division where no one EVER gets promoted and I thought having a female executive might help; and Anthony knew and really respected her work. She is very talented in our field and also a minor-level girlboss influencer.\n\nOur department loves gossip, and the rumors about Anthony and Lyla started practically immediately: He was bringing her coffee on their in-office days, hanging out in her cubicle area, and they were often leaving the office together. Someone even saw them having drinks in a bar after work, on a night I had been told to stay late in the office. He assured me it was all professional\u2014\u201dThat\u2019s what senior people do\u201d\u2014but we definitely fought about it and I swore Lyla was shooting me dirty looks. Eventually, we took a break to figure things out and I started working remotely from my parents, but we\u2019ve been talking again and I thought it was going well.\n\nThen, Lyla\u2019s social media account blew up as she told a multipart story about her work bestie who had an abusive, controlling partner. Plot twist: The partner\u2019s a junior woman in another division, and she and the \u201cbestie\u201d are in love. Everyone we work with under a certain age has seen at least some of it either on their TikTok or IG. Obviously, Anthony and I are not getting back together but how can I show my face back in the office? My boss told me that Lyla has issued a full return to office policy for March, and the other women in the office say the gossip is that I\u2019ll quit rather than come back, but I can\u2019t afford that.\n\n\u2014Girlboss Gone Bad\n\nDear Girlboss Gone Bad,\n\nI read your letter with my mouth agape and was prepared to ride at dawn for you even before you got to the part where Lyla trashed you on social media. What is this, seventh grade? And don\u2019t even get me started on your shitty fianc\u00e9.\n\nNeedless to say, Lyla\u2019s behavior would be awful under any circumstance, but the fact that she\u2019s your boss\u2019s boss takes it to another level. Since my preferred next steps involved things that would probably be illegal, I asked Michelle Cohen Levy, a South Florida-based employment lawyer, what you should actually do\u2014assuming you want to keep your job.\n\nShe said that while a court likely would not consider this workplace harassment (boo), Lyla should still be investigated for abusing her position for things like making you stay late so she could go out with Anthony (if she was, in fact, the person who told you to stay working that night). Before you go to human resources, though, Cohen Levy suggests \u201cmaking a timeline of every time Lyla abused her power (as much as you are able to recreate), including things like being passed over for assignments or advancement opportunities.\u201d\n\nI wondered whether you should expect confidentiality once you report to HR, and Cohen Levy had some unfortunate news about that. \u201cLyla will totally know that she\u2019s the one who brought the issue to HR,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s usually one of the biggest surprises to people when they make a complaint to HR.\u201d Still, you should be on the lookout for any retaliation from Lyla and report it immediately to HR.\n\nIn terms of what will happen during the investigation, Cohen Levy said that HR will interview you, Lyla, probably Anthony, and maybe a couple of other people that Lyla supervises to get an idea of her working relationship with them. Also, Cohen Levy emphasized that you should not expect to know the outcome of the investigation, unless there\u2019s some sort of serious repercussion for Lyla, like a demotion or termination. \u201cHR rarely discloses the actual consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cThey usually say something along the lines of, \u2018The investigation has concluded and appropriate remedial action taken.\u2019\u201d\n\nI have to say, I am not thrilled at the prospect of you having to go through this, even if it does end in Lyla\u2019s demotion or termination, because it sounds like you\u2019re in for a few weeks or months of high stress at work\u2014during a time when you\u2019re already dealing with the pain of disentangling your life from your former fianc\u00e9. I can imagine that the office gossip mill might be in overdrive when you return, but hopefully, if you don\u2019t give them anything to feed off of, they\u2019ll move on eventually. And I know it\u2019s not going to be easy to go back to an office where Lyla and Anthony are both still working; I\u2019m sure running into them in the elevator is not your idea of a good time. With all of that taken into account, if I were you, I would start looking for another job, keep my head down at work, and try to stay out of Lyla\u2019s way. Unfortunately, as unsatisfying as it is, Cohen Levy said that, \u201cAnthony probably gets away with this one because, from a workplace perspective, he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d Go figure.\n\n\u2014Doree\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nYou\u2019ve answered several questions encouraging tolerance of friends\u2019 terrible spouses, and I wonder if this takes it to a different level. We are a mom group with 5 year olds, and one day Jenny called us together to tearfully report that her home had been raided by the FBI\u2026",

            "content": "A UPS driver walks near his truck during a winter storm in Tucker, Georgia. [AP Photo/Brynn Anderson]\n\nUPS has announced a new wave of layoffs that will leave hundreds of workers in multiple states without a job. The announced layoffs will affect 198 UPS workers in Charlotte, North Carolina on March 31, 65 UPS workers in Hialeah, Florida on April 27, and an undisclosed number of UPS workers in Portland, Oregon on July 1.\n\nThis comes immediately after layoffs were initiated mid-January in Vernon, California, Commerce City, Colorado, Portland, Oregon and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, affecting nearly 1,200 UPS workers this year.\n\n\n\nThese cuts are part of an ongoing barrage of job cuts at the company, which is seeking to drastically reduce labor costs by implementing automation and artificial intelligence technologies at the expense of workers as part of the \u201cNetwork of the Future\u201d initiative announced last year.\n\nUPS has continued their layoffs without any serious opposition from the Teamsters union, which purports to represent some 300,000 workers at UPS.\n\nThe catalyst for these layoffs was implemented by the Teamsters bureaucracy itself through President Sean O\u2019Brien\u2019s fraudulent \u201cStrike Ready\u201d campaign in 2023. Prior to the expiration of the contract, UPS workers revealed their willingness to fight with a 97 percent strike vote.\n\nAs UPS workers voiced their support for a strike, tens of thousands of members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) were also on strike fighting for protections against job loss from automation and AI.\n\n\n\nThe potential for an enormous joint struggle between actors, writers and UPSers was sabotaged by the Teamsters bureaucracy, which called off the strike a week before the deadline with the announcement of a \u201chistoric\u201d agreement with UPS.\n\n\n\nThe only thing \u201chistoric\u201d about the agreement is the number of layoffs it has allowed. Since it has gone into effect, some 40,000 UPS workers have been fired or laid off.\n\nThe refusal of the Teamsters apparatus to fight in defense of UPS workers and their jobs is not unique in the slightest.\n\nIn 2023, the Teamsters sold out workers to Wall Street during the bankruptcy of the trucking and logistics company Yellow, which led to the wholesale destruction of over 30,000 jobs. This happened after the Teamsters handed Yellow $5 billion worth of concessions across multiple sellout contracts to supposedly \u201csave\u201d jobs and prevent a bankruptcy.\n\nRevealing the social chasm between the labor bureaucrats and the rank and file, while Yellow workers were calling for a joint strike with UPS workers, O\u2019Brien called off a strike and peddled the lie that in doing so, it would buy Yellow enough time to pay into workers\u2019 pensions. The company used the time afforded to them to file for bankruptcy in terms more favorable to themselves while workers received nothing.\n\n\n\nMost recently the Teamsters blocked a strike at the retail giant Costco. Mirroring the betrayal at UPS, 18,000 Costco workers voted by a wide margin of 85 percent to initiate trike action but Teamsters officials overrode this decision and announced announced a tentative agreement which fell far short of worker\u2019s demands. The sellout contract brought forward by the Teamsters was passed by a slim margin of 53 percent to 46 percent with widespread dissatisfaction among the membership.\n\nThe recent betrayals of the Teamsters bureaucracy are not a reversal of their previous course but a continuation of their rotten role of policing the working class on behalf of the financial aristocracy.\n\nAt a time when near-daily protests are taking place against Trump\u2019s attacks on immigration, science and federal workers, the Teamsters apparatus is terrified that a major strike by UPS workers could catalyze not only the 1.2 million members across the US and Canada, but also intersect with a broader movement against Trump\u2019s dictatorial measures and exploding social inequality.\n\nMuch like the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which has refused to call for strike action even as Trump/Musk purge thousands of government workers, claims to represent federal workers, the Teamsters are far more worried about a genuine movement from below that threatens their six-figure salaries than they are of Trump and fascistic forms of rule.\n\nOn the contrary, O\u2019Brien attended the inauguration of the fascist president and has supported Trump\u2019s reactionary cabinet nominees and the anti-immigrant, pro-Wall Street policies of the Republican Party more broadly.\n\nOn Monday, Republican Representative Lori Chavez DeRemer was voted in as acting Labor Secretary in a bipartisan 67-32 vote. Prior to the vote, the Teamsters official X/Twitter account praised DeRemer as \u201ca champion for American workers,\u201d while attacking Democrats and Republicans for voting against her nomination.\n\nDeRemer, like every capitalist politician, is not a \u201cchampion\u201d for the working class, but for the financial oligarchy and US imperialism. Her top donors in the 2023-2024 election cycle included Nike Inc. ($19,875), infamous for global sweatshops, and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ($122,354), the foremost Zionist and pro-genocide lobby in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe Teamsters backed her nomination due to her previously stated support for the \u201cProtecting the Right Organize\u201d Act or PRO Act. The central purpose of the Democratic Party-crafted legislation is to bolster the union bureaucracies which are increasingly, and deservedly, reviled by the majority of workers.\n\nRecent experiences at UPS, Costco and Yellow underscore that the fight to protect jobs and workplace safety cannot and will not be initiated by the Teamsters bureaucracy, or any other nationalist trade union officials, who have made their peace with Trump, corporate America and his fascist minions overseeing key government positions.\n\nThe way forward requires workers breaking with both big business parties and the trade unions, which function as labor police for Wall Street. Logistics workers, and every section of the working class, must build independent rank-and-file committees to transfer power from the corrupt apparatus to the workers on the shop floor.",

            "content": "This post was updated March 9 at 9:19 p.m.\n\nRoom sign-ups for returning students have come to a close, and many are feeling less than satisfied with their housing enrollment experience.\n\nRSU is the online process where returning undergraduate students can select housing for the upcoming academic year, according to the UCLA Housing website. Through the RSU enrollment process, students have the option to enroll in on-campus housing or university apartments.\n\nThis year, changes to RSU were announced Jan. 21 and enrollment began Feb. 18.\n\nUCLA Housing recently changed the types of university housing available to students, adding four-bedroom, 10-person apartments in Gayley Heights, Laurel, Palo Verde and Tipuana and two-bedroom, eight-person apartments in Levering Terrace. The housing changes removed four-bedroom, eight-person apartments from Gayley Heights, Laurel, Palo Verde and Tipuana apartment buildings and two-bedroom, six-person units in Levering Terrace, according to the UCLA Housing website.\n\nThe process for gender-inclusive room selection has remained the same, according to an emailed statement from a UCLA Housing spokesperson. The website said students enrolled in gender-inclusive housing can select from rooms pre-designated as gender-inclusive housing.\n\n[RELATED: UCLA Housing to transition most on-campus dorms to triple occupancy]\n\nDerrick Phu, a third-year biology student, said his roommate group of six boys and two girls signed up for gender-inclusive housing and hoped to get either a two-bedroom, six-person university apartment or a two-bedroom, four-person apartment. One of his roommates works for UCLA Dining Services, which gave their group an early RSU enrollment time, leading Phu to believe their enrollment would go well, he added.\n\n\u201cBut by the time it rolled over to our time, even though there were so many rooms open, the amount of gender-inclusive rooms was almost down to zero,\u201d Phu said. \u201cYou had to either enroll in something on the Hill, which is triples and something we don\u2019t want, or it\u2019s something of a four-10 (10 students in four bedrooms), which is what we had to do.\u201d\n\nHe also said his group did not expect the options for gender-inclusive housing to be limited at the time of their enrollment.\n\nAccording to the UCLA Housing statement, the number of requests for gender-inclusive housing decreased this year, so the number of designated gender-inclusive units both on campus and in university apartments also decreased. The available spaces for single-gender male, single-gender female, non-binary and gender-inclusive spaces are proportional to the total number of requests received for these spaces, the statement added.\n\nEllie Chun, a third-year psychology student, said her roommate group opted for gender-inclusive housing and had enrollment on the first day of RSU. They said they had hoped to enroll in a two-bedroom, four-person apartment.\n\n\u201cBy the time it hit noon, there was no gender-inclusive spots left for two-fours,\u201d she said.\n\nChun and their roommates enrolled in a 10-person university apartment but ultimately decided to move into off-campus housing, they said. Gender-inclusive housing is the primary housing option for non-binary people, she said, adding that she would like to see more gender-inclusive housing options.\n\nAnother change to this year\u2019s RSU process was roommate groups and individual students choosing their housing at the same time and roommate groups not being given priority, the Housing website said.\n\nFor students living on the Hill, the website also said most units will transition to triple occupancy, as demand for on-campus housing increases. Single-and double-occupancy rooms will not be available during RSU and are reserved for students supported by the Center for Accessible Education, the website added.\n\nNathan Huynh, a second-year material engineering student, said he would not mind living in a triple next year, but feels there should be more on-campus housing options for upperclassmen who want to live in rooms with double-occupancy units. He added that he did not want to apply for university apartments because of the possibility of living in a four-bedroom, 10-person unit.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed at the fact that UCLA made it all triples without the option to double,\u201d Huynh said.\n\nWhen addressing the shift to triple occupancy, the emailed statement said while the change may feel different from previous years, the goal is to \u201cprovide a high-quality residential experience for all.\u201d\n\nIf more housing changes occur, Huynh said he hopes information will be provided to students earlier.\n\nThe emailed statement said in order to keep the enrollment system fair, time slots are assigned based on class year, so rising fourth-year students had priority over underclassmen.\n\n\u201cWithin each class year, time slot numbers are randomly generated to ensure fairness among students in the same group,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile some options may be limited by the time a student\u2019s selection window arrives, we remain committed to providing all students with living options that support their academic and social experience.\u201d\n\nNicole Curristan, a third-year environmental science student, said her roommate group of six people \u2013 including five rising seniors \u2013 hoped to receive an earlier enrollment time since non-priority enrollment times are allocated based on seniority. She added that her experience with RSU was frustrating because the two-bedroom, six-person apartment type her roommate group wanted was not available at the time of her housing enrollment, and her roommate group had to split up and enroll in two different 10-person apartments.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any sort of priority status, then you\u2019re just left to fend for yourself,\u201d Curristan said.\n\nStudents may not always get their first choice of housing during this process, the UCLA Housing statement said, adding that with thousands of residents selecting housing, availability naturally changes as the process moves forward.\n\nHer roommate group decided to pull out of RSU and find off-campus housing, Curristan said, adding that living in a space with more than six people would be too overwhelming.\n\n\u201cI think it really just comes down to who you know, which is really unfair in a lot of ways,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I feel lucky that I have friends who are graduating who have apartments and leases that they\u2019re looking to pass down to people.\u201d\n\nIn the future, Chun said they hope to see more options for gender-inclusive housing and options for student feedback on the RSU and housing experience.\n\n\u201cI wish that they would hear and listen to their students a little bit more,\u201d Chun said.",

Then, just before the final buzzer, the referee ruled that Neal recorded a two-point near fall for the win.\n\n\u201cThat was a tough match,\u201d Union Local head coach Nate Starkey admitted. \u201cHe got the cradle on him late in the second period, and I honestly thought the referee was going to call it a pin, but he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cGunnar wrestled the right way. He stuck to our game plan,\u201d Starkey said. \u201cIt was unfortunate that he gave up those late points.\u201d\n\nGossett finished sixth last year at 144.\n\n\u201cHe will bounce back and be even better next year,\u201d Starkey said.\n\nKing, a senior, ended his career with a fine 54-3 record, but not the title that he coveted.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, King went ahead 2-0 with a reversal to start the second period and led 2-1 entering the third. Quaintance drew even with an escape and then recorded a takedown for a 5-2 advantage.\n\nKing was awarded a penalty point for stalling near the end of the third period and recorded an escape just before the final buzzer, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cHe had a fine season but not the end that he wanted,\u201d Barnesville head coach Jayson Stephen said. \u201cHe started out good but then let that kid dictate the match late.\u201d\n\nBarnesville also place-winners in sophomore Colt Carpenter (138-5th) and junior Hines Ford (175-4th).\n\nUnion Local\u2019s Brody Perzanowski (175-6th); Martins Ferry\u2019s Colten Nixon (126-7th); and Harrison Central freshman Knox McKibben (215-5th) rounded out the medalists.\n\nAfter a state runner up finish in the D-III team race a year ago, Barnesville wound up eighth this year with 53.5 points.",

This has confused Summit County residents who discovered that UPS would no longer deliver to PO boxes at US post offices.\n\nThe issue was further complicated by USPS's refusal to deliver to most physical addresses, leading to a significant number of undelivered packages.\n\nIn response, the US Postal Service stated it is working on a \"new strategic approach\" with companies like UPS that use its Parcel Select service.\n\n\"Prior agreements failed to reflect operational and financial realities, the evolving postal network, or the enhancements to our portfolio of product offerings. As a result of our new approach, some businesses negotiated new agreements with us, and some have not,\" the mail agency wrote.\n\nThe statement added: \"Throughout this process we have been transparent - both publicly and privately - with business partners, customers and the shipping industry about our intent to either negotiate new agreements or to let prior disadvantageous agreements expire. Communications to affected businesses began in the Spring of 2024 with multiple, follow-on public announcements made through the end of the year.\"\n\nImage: AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSince the contract ended, nearly a dozen Summit County residents have reached out to Summit Daily News detailing packages that were returned to sender and confusion about how to get parcels delivered in the mountains.\n\n\"We're still trying to figure out what's the best way to get items shipped to us. It's very time consuming. You can be on hold for a while. Because we don't have mailboxes here, USPS cannot deliver here - but UPS will deliver here, and USPS will only deliver to the P.O. box,\" Frisco resident Patti Plummer (Spell) said.\n\nBreckenridge resident Jonathan DeSimone said that he had three packages returned to sender when the contract between the U.S. Postal Service and UPS ended.\n\nDeSimone explained it was especially frustrating that the change occurred just after the holiday season, when many people were expecting more packages than usual.\n\nHe also noted that residents of mountain towns can't always buy the items they need locally, so they sometimes rely on packages being delivered.\n\n\"It would've been nice if they communicated how this was going to go down, and, No. 2, this is a different arrangement for a mountain community, a rural community than it is if you're living in Denver or Boulder or Colorado Springs,\" DeSimone said.",

(CBS12) \u2014 Governor Ron DeSantis took aim at property taxes Tuesday morning during his annual State of the State address, saying \"taxpayers need relief.\"\n\nDeSantis expressed concern over escalating local government property taxes and supported legislative efforts to provide constitutional protections for Florida homeowners.\n\n\"You buy a home, you pay off the mortgage, and yet you still have to write a check to the government every year just for the privilege of living on your own private property,\" he argued.\n\nDeSantis concluded by reaffirming his stance against state tax increases, stating, \"This body will not pass tax increases and this governor will not sign any tax increases.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Florida House of Representatives Chamber, DeSantis highlighted the state's economic achievements and legislative reforms. In his speech, the Republican governor also focused on key issues such as education, transportation, environmental protection, and tax relief in general.\n\nRead the full story .\n\nFourth suspect surrenders in UPS theft ring that caused $500K in phones, iMacs losses\n\nPALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. (CBS12) \u2014 The fourth suspect in an organized theft ring that targeted UPS packages containing cell phones and other electronic devices has turned himself in.\n\nAccording to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBSO), Samuel Drummond turned himself into detectives on Wednesday. Drummond was the owner of GoalMind Studios, a recording studio and cell phone repair shop in Lantana, that authorities found as operating as a front for selling stolen merchandise.\n\nPrevious reports say PBSO's investigation began in October after UPS representatives reached out to them, claiming that T-Mobile had recognized they were losing thousands of dollars from two Lake Worth locations, which began in July 2024. The losses amounted to over $504,000.\n\nAccording to the probable cause affidavit, T-Mobile's internal investigation led them to trace the stolen goods back to California by placing GPS tracking devices in the packages they believed were being stolen.\n\nThrough the investigation, detectives learned that Griffon White was a UPS supervisor and managed delivering the stolen packages to the recording studio.\n\nRead the full story .\n\nSee also:\n\nBright lights over Florida as SpaceX Starship debris burns up in latest test flight\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (CBS12) \u2014 Wondering what that bright light was in South Florida skies?\n\nAccording to CNN, SpaceX's Starship launched its eighth test flight out of South Texas. The Martin County Sheriff's Office said the SpaceX rocket was carrying Starlink satellite when it experienced a breakup during launch. It resulted in the spacecraft debris re-entering the atmosphere.\n\nVideo shared to CBS12 News shows the spacecraft, which looks like falling meteors, falling from the sky. Another video captured in Hobe Sound shows the debris which looks like burning balls of light sailing through a dark sky.\n\nCNN says SpaceX \"notched another successful Super Heavy booster catch\", however, it lost contact with the spacecraft only a few short minutes into the flight.\n\nThe objectives for the eighth launch were an attempt to reignite a Starship engine in space and to deploy batch \"mock satellites.\"\n\nRead the full story .\n\nHusband crashes truck into Port St. Lucie home\n\nPORT ST.

The crash left, what appeared to be a living room, practically fully exposed, revealing a couch and even a lamp, and left debris scattered on the ground.\n\nSt. Lucie County Fire Rescue blocked off a portion of the road as they worked to put up temporary beams to support the house.\n\nJohn has lived in the neighborhood for more than 10 years and said he was shocked to see the vehicle in the home.\n\nRead the full story .\n\nDOGE targets U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, including massive Florida facility\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (CBS12) \u2014 The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is now focusing on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a crucial agency under the Department of Defense that handles both military and civilian projects. One of its largest projects is in Palm Beach County, but powerful political voices in Florida are calling for changes.\n\nDOGE's list of canceled government leases is growing, including homes, warehouses, and office buildings that are either too large or unused. This week, the massive Jacksonville office building, which has been the Army Corps' regional headquarters since 2007, was added to the list. The agency now has just months to find a new location.\n\nThe Corps of Engineers has a significant presence in Florida, responding to hurricanes, overseeing Lake Okeechobee\u2019s locks, and managing miles of coastline. It also partners with the state on Everglades restoration, one of its largest and most costly projects.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis supports cutting bureaucracy and letting states take more control. He has expressed frustration with the Army Corps' delays and bureaucracy, asking the Trump administration to turn parts of the Everglades restoration over to the state. DeSantis said, \u201cSo our request is going to be just block grant us the money, cut the Army Corps out, and let us build the damn thing.

Here's our take on 5 pop ups\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Dubai flavors: Museum of the Future immerses SXSW in innovation The Museum of the Future at SXSW is bringing more than futuristic visions to Austin; they're offering a blend of tech and delicious Dubai chocolate.\n\nThe South by Southwest Conference and Festival isn't just bringing panels and performances to Austin; it's transforming the city into a living, breathing playground, surreal and spectacular. This year, ditch the badge envy and dive headfirst into a whirlwind of immersive experiences, where the future is on display and extraterrestrials feel alarmingly close. These aren't just passive exhibits. These activations offer a tangible escape, a chance to not just observe, but to participate.\n\nMore: Seeing Austin's signature event through ever-changing vantage points as SXSW 2025 begins\n\nTry the viral Dubai chocolate at the Museum of the Future\n\nDitch the breakfast tacos and grab a glimpse of tomorrow at the Museum of the Future activation, popping up at 3rd & Congress until Tuesday, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m everyday. Is it a portal to Dubai, or just a really convincing mirage? Either way, you're in for a treat (and maybe a sugar rush).\n\nFirst, dive into a digital dreamscape of blooming pixels \u2013 think less \"Keep Austin Weird,\" more \"Keep Austin Immersed.\" Then, unleash your inner visionary with \"Leaders for Humanity,\" a card game that's basically Cards Against Humanity, but for building a utopian future instead of destroying friendships.\n\nFinally, the moment your social media feeds have been screaming about: Dubai chocolate. Yes, that chocolate. We're talking the stuff that broke the internet, now breaking free from your screen and into your mouth. (Pro tip: grab the chai tea early, or you'll be left with just the sweet, sweet FOMO).\n\nCome see if the future tastes as good as it looks. Or, at the very least, as good as hyped-up chocolate.\n\n\u2014 Ana Gutierrez\n\nDon't miss a moment of SXSW 2025! Sign up for our newsletter\n\nPrepare for a parasite check at FX's Alien: Earth\n\nFX's \"Alien: Earth\" activation has crash-landed at 318 E 5th St and is only staying in town for one more night: Saturday, from 2:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. But trust me, you'll want to go after dark for maximum spine-tingling effect.\n\nNo, it's not a happy hour \u2013 this is spooky hour. Step into a crashed space vessel where you'll be scanned for parasites (because, you know, just in case) and armed with a flashlight. You're about to join Sydney Chandler's crew as they stumble upon something far worse than a bad hangover: Earth's greatest threat, straight from the upcoming Hulu series.\n\nExpect actors, props, and enough jump scares to make your cowboy boots tremble. Grab your flashlight, explore the wreckage, and snag some swag \u2013 stickers, buttons, and a badge to prove you survived.\n\n- A.G.\n\nScream your heart out in the Blumhouse box\n\nSXSW activations often do the most. The bigger, flashier and more eye-catching the better. How else can they draw in a crowd whose attention is constantly drawn in a million different directions?\n\nBlumhouse Production's activation is none of those things. It's an unassuming, small black box located on the Northwest side of the Austin Convention Center. However, the horror-focused company plays into a feeling nearly every human has felt at some point; the desire to rip out the loudest, most cathartic, earth-shattering scream possible.\n\nFrustration can be dealt with in different ways, whether it's venting to friends, working out, or channeling it into art \u2014 it can't stay pent up. But sometimes the pressure builds until it becomes too much to bear, and Blumhouse provides the perfect excuse to release the untapped emotion unfit for human ears. They even have a meter if you want to measure what decibel your voice reaches. I reached 104 after remembering the Dallas Mavericks traded Luka Doncic for pennies on a $100 bill.\n\n\u2014 Caleb Yum\n\nAmazon Prime takes over San Jose Hotel\n\nAmazon Prime's activation at San Jose Hotel is a laidback affair featuring activities based on shows like \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" and movies such as \"Another Simple Favor.\" They're giving out free tote bags, onto which you can stick patches from each station.\n\nIt wasn't my favorite activation, but it was a good place to relax and have a drink. After taking in all it has to offer, you can explore the rest of South Congress too.\n\n\u2014 CY\n\nParamount's 'The Lodge' at the Clive Bar leans into dark themes\n\nParamount's \"The Lodge\" is hosted at the Clive Bar, basing its offerings on \"Yellow Jackets,\" \"The Gladiator 2,\" \"Dexter: Original Sin\" and more. Between Paramount and Prime, I definitely preferred this one more \u2014 Paramount leaned into the darker themes of some of its shows, and the set designs were a lot more intricate.\n\nThere are three floors of stations for fans to explore. The rooftop is an open-air bar style area which features photo opportunities based on \"1915\" and \"Star Trek, Strange New Worlds.\"\n\n\u2014 CY",

The firm said it raised 500 million yuan from the two fundraising events. Its investors include China Merchants Group, EV maker Nio and Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post.\n\nFounded in 2022, LimX Dynamics develops humanoid robots that can lift heavy loads and be deployed in factories and warehouses.\n\nAI2Robotics said its latest funding round collected more than 100 million yuan from institutions such as Dunhong Capital and Yunqi Capital. Dunhong is known for its early investment in Unitree Robotics.\n\nTwo months ago, AI2Robotics said it completed a fundraising that raised \"hundreds of millions of yuan\" from Dunhong Capital, Fortune Capital and CoStone Capital.

In prelims, swimmers qualify for one of two finals heats: the top 8 finishers make the A final, places 9 through 16 the B final. In finals, swimmers are locked into their respective final, meaning a swimmer in the B heat (spots 9-16) can only place as high as 9th or as low as 16th, even if they put up the fastest or slowest time of any heat in the final.\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ll be tracking \u201cUps\u201d and \u201cDowns\u201d after each prelims session. \u201cUp\u201d refers to swimmers and divers in the A final, \u201cDown\u201d to B finalists.\n\nWomen\u2019s Meet\n\nWomen\u2019s Top 10 After Day 3\n\nKeiser 434.5 St Thomas 297.5 Cumberlands 253.5 Lindsey Wilson 251 SCAD Savannah 170 Bethel IN 169.5 Olivet Nazarene 137 Indiana Wesleyan 129 Union Commonwealth 128 Milligan 111\n\nWhile Keiser has been out front by a large margin all weekend, and St Thomas has a lock on second place, there have been some pretty exciting team races for third place (Cumberlands vs Lindsey Wilson), fifth place (Bethel Indiana vs SCAD Savannah), and seventh place (Olivet Nazarene vs Milligan) brewing.\n\nBethel had a huge morning, outscoring the psych sheet by 28 points.

            "content": "Rollercoaster ups and downs of closed theme park adored by generations\n\n7 days ago Share Save Oscar Edwards BBC News Share Save\n\nDiary of A Rollercoaster Girl Oakwood Theme Park opened in 1987 but has closed its doors before the start of the 2025 season\n\nThey say life can be like a rollercoaster, but for Richard Drummond and his family, it is a ride that has lasted for three generations. Richard, his dad and his two sons have all worked at Oakwood Theme Park, in Pembrokeshire, over the last 30 years. But on Tuesday, Wales' largest theme park announced it was shutting down with immediate effect due to a drop in visitor numbers. It has left Richard, and thrill-seekers around the world, wondering what comes next for the once-great attraction.\n\nRichard, 48, from Pembroke Dock, joined Oakwood in 1995 at a time when they employed about 400 seasonal staff each year. \"I was 18 or 19 and met lots of people from all over. You met all these people that you had never met before,\" he said. The park, which opened in 1987, was originally owned by William McNamara - a Pembrokeshire farmer diversifying into the leisure industry. \"You would see the directors walking around the park. Their kids worked there as well. The owners were willing to get their hands dirty,\" Richard added.\n\nRichard Drummond Richard started out in the food stalls at Oakwood in 1995\n\nRichard witnessed the birth of the world-renowned rollercoaster Megafobia in 1996. \"I could see this structure slowly going in and I was thinking, I know that's going to be pretty impressive when it's finished,\" he said. \"A lot of us that worked there were the first people to go on it.\"\n\nThe site, which opened in 1987, announced on Wednesday it would be shutting immediately\n\nMr McNamara went on to create the neighbouring Bluestone holiday resort and sold Oakwood to Spanish leisure giant Aspro in 2008. Richard believes they \"underestimated\" the task at hand. \"It costs a lot of money to replace parts, especially because most of them come from Europe,\" he said. In 2009 Aspro decided to halve the number of full-time employees and Richard was let go after 14 years at Oakwood.\n\nRichard Drummond Richard and his two sons riding Megafobia at Oakwood\n\nRichard's dad, who has worked at the site over the last couple of years, said he believed the park was in decline. \"He would tell me we only had so many people in today, or they had to close this ride because they didn't have enough staff,\" Richard said. Due to a drop in visitor numbers, Oakwood Theme Park owners Aspro Park said \"future investment\" was \"unsustainable\" for the attraction. The company added \"all possible avenues\" had been explored to avoid the closure, and that \"unrelenting economic challenges\" from electricity costs, ride parts and food and drink inflation, as well as changes to National Insurance thresholds affected the decision. The park's closure has left Richard feeling \"emotional\", but he plans to have a staff reunion this summer to share the good times they had at the attraction.\n\nJustin Garvanovic A 28-year-old Justin sat with a test dummy trialling Megafobia in February 1996\n\nJustin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club, remembers the first whispers about a wooden coaster coming to Wales. \"I bumped into William McNamara in Blackpool looking at the Big Dipper wooden coaster there. I put two and two together immediately,\" he said. \"We would go down every two weeks to see William, and his brother Paddy, to see the ride being built.\" Justin and his fellow club members loved it so much they decided to host an annual trip at Oakwood - known as the Welsh Weekender. The European Coaster Club celebrated their 25th trip to Oakwood last year as part of their annual get together. A new venue will have be found for the annual pilgrimage, but Justin admitted it will be hard to replace the \"special and unique\" Oakwood setting.\n\nJustin Garvanovic The Welsh Weekender, pictured in 1999, was held at Oakwood for 25 years\n\nJustin said he \"sadly\" saw the closure coming after what he described as the park's decline in recent years. \"It's a fantastic park, but if you talk to people in England, they don't know it exists,\" he said. The world has lost \"one of the world's best wooden coasters\" in Megafobia, according to Justin. He said Pembrokeshire is a \"wonderful part of the world\", but added Oakwood has been asking the same question for decades. \"How do you get all these people to know that this treasure is there?\"\n\nJustin broke the news that Oakwood was building its Megafobia ride in the First Drop magazine\n\nKorey Kiepert, from Cincinnati, Ohio, is a rollercoaster designer and engineer who was involved in the refurbishment of Megafobia three years ago. The 50-year-old adores theme parks and even commemorated his wedding day with a rollercoaster ride. \"Megafobia is special,\" he said. \"We really felt like we improved it and brought it back to life.\" It has been a \"whirlwind of emotions\" for Korey hearing about the park's closure. \"Oakwood is magical. It's got a lot of nice trees and it's just out in the open. All of that just adds to the experience,\" he said.\n\nKorey Kiepert Korey standing on Megafobia during the refurbishments made to the ride in 2022\n\nKorey said the park's closure is a result of a \"perfect storm\" as costs increase both for the park and its visitors. \"If you want to go to Oakwood from the big cities, you have to decide that you're going to take that four-hour drive or the train,\" he said. He added he would \"love it\" if a new theme park was able to take on some of the rides at Oakwood, including Megafobia. \"If I had a million dollars, I would love to just take it and have it as my very own,\" he said.\n\nKorey Kiepert Korey and his wife on their wedding day riding the GhostRider in California in 1999\n\nNick Hutson is a British composer known for his work in the theme park industry. The 40-year-old has provided music for firework shows, Halloween events and even parties at Oakwood in the past. \"It gave some most beautiful views with the sun setting behind Megafobia,\" he said. \"It was a joy to do music for them, and I will miss working for them a lot.\"\n\nNick Hutson Nick Hutson composed music for Oakwood Theme Park for many years\n\nNick's role allowed him to combine his passions as a \"self-confessed theme park fan\" as well as a musician. He recalls hosting an after-dark event that had a \"festival vibe\" at the park. \"I put together a techno party track,\" he said. \"They had live singers, a paint party and fireworks. It was my favourite time to be at the park.\"\n\nNick Hutson An after-dark event held at the theme park in 2022\n\nIs the theme park industry in danger?",

            "content": "Summit County residents shared what solutions and work-arounds they have found to get mail delivered by the U.S. Postal Service and UPS after contract changes, including UPS Surepost\n\nColorado mountain residents are reporting that the end of a contract between the U.S. Postal Service and UPS has led to many packages being returned to sender and continued confusion about how to get packages delivered.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service's contract with UPS SurePost -- the company's economy shipping option -- ended at the beginning of January. Summit County residents soon learned, usually because their packages failed to arrive, that the change meant UPS would no longer deliver to P.O. boxes at U.S. post offices.\n\nThis has created a dilemma for many Summit County residents, since the U.S. Postal Service won't deliver packages to most physical addresses. Yet, when shopping online, residents say it's not easy to tell whether a vendor is sending a package via the U.S. Postal Service, UPS or another delivery company.\n\n\"We're still trying to figure out what's the best way to get items shipped to us,\" Frisco resident Patti Plummer (Spell) said. \"It's very time consuming. You can be on hold for a while. Because we don't have mailboxes here, USPS cannot deliver here -- but UPS will deliver here, and USPS will only deliver to the P.O. box.\"\n\nUnder the now-expired contract, UPS was previously able to drop off packages at U.S. Post Offices -- like those in Breckenridge, Frisco, Silverthorne and Dillon -- for \"last-mile delivery,\" where residents with P.O. boxes could pick them up.\n\nBut since the contract ended, nearly a dozen Summit County residents have reached out to Summit Daily News detailing packages that were returned to sender and confusion about how to get parcels delivered in the mountains.\n\nBreckenridge resident Jonathan DeSimone said that he had three different packages that were returned to sender when the contract between the U.S. Postal Service and UPS ended. It was especially frustrating that the change occurred just after the holiday season, when many people were expecting more packages than usual, DeSimone said. He also noted that residents of mountain towns can't always buy the items they need locally, so they sometimes rely on packages being delivered.\n\n\"It would've been nice if they communicated how this was going to go down, and, No. 2, this is a different arrangement for a mountain community, a rural community than it is if you're living in Denver or Boulder or Colorado Springs,\" DeSimone said. \"You actually get U.S. (Postal Service) mail delivery to your physical residences in those communities. In mountain towns, you don't, most of the time.\"\n\nResidents told Summit Daily News that they used to be able to list their P.O. box and the physical address of the post office for package delivery, but now they're sometimes left guessing whether to list their P.O. box or physical address when online vendors don't say which service will be doing the delivery.\n\n\"I don't know how my stuff is getting sent unless (the online vendor) specifically says, which is about one of 10 times,\" said Ian Zinner, a resident of unincorporated Summit County. \"We pretty much just put our home address and hope that it shows up.\"\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service said in a statement that it has been working to implement a \"new strategic approach\" with its contracts with package consolidator companies, such as UPS, that use its Parcel Select service for high voluming shipping -- including negotiating new agreements.\n\n\"Prior agreements failed to reflect operational and financial realities, the evolving postal network, or the enhancements to our portfolio of product offerings,\" the U.S. Postal Service said in the statement. \"As a result of our new approach, some businesses negotiated new agreements with us, and some have not.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Service did not respond to questions from Summit Daily News regarding what the end of the contract with UPS SurePost means for those with P.O. boxes or how the changes could impact delivery in rural communities like Summit County.\n\nUPS also did not respond to questions about changes to its SurePost program, how customers with P.O. box would be affected or the best way for customers to ensure that their mail reaches them.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service said in its statement that it has maintained transparency throughout its new strategic approach and will continue to communicate \"openly and transparently\" moving forward.\n\n\"Throughout this process we have been transparent -- both publicly and privately -- with business partners, customers and the shipping industry about our intent to either negotiate new agreements or to let prior disadvantageous agreements expire,\" the U.S. Postal Service statement said. \"Communications to affected businesses began in the Spring of 2024 with multiple, follow-on public announcements made through the end of the year. How these aggregating businesses have communicated about these developments to their stakeholders is beyond the control or responsibility of the Postal Service.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Michael Bennet said in a statement that he \"continues to advocate that (the U.S. Postal Service) prioritize excellent customer service in its operations and is deeply concerned by reports that President (Donald) Trump plans to privatize the (Postal Service) or remove the Board of Governors.\"\n\nSummit County residents interviewed by Summit Daily said that they have not found an easy solution for ordering packages online unless the retailer lists which service will be doing the delivery, which not every retailer does.\n\nContacting the retailer to find out which delivery service they use -- so residents know whether to list their physical address or P.O. box -- appears to be the best solution, according to residents, but it isn't always easy to get ahold of the retailer.\n\n\"A lot of times the vendor doesn't know, because they've outsourced third-party logistics to somebody so somebody else is fulfilling and being that last mile. So it just requires you to go, \"OK, who is the last mile here? Can I have this package sent directly to a P.O. box via U.S. (Postal Service) mail? Can I have this package sent via UPS or some other carrier directly to a physical location that's not a post office?\"\" DeSimone said. \"Listen, it's not putting a man on the moon. It's just a little bit of work to go figure it all out.\"\n\nPlummer said that when ordering items on Amazon, she has started having them delivered to the Whole Foods Market in Frisco, rather than listing her P.O. box or physical address. She said, however, this hasn't worked with larger items she's tried to order, like a fencing for the stairway in her house. The Whole Food Market is the only Amazon pickup location listed in Summit County.\n\n\"The only way I have been able to resolve things is after they have been returned (to sender) is I've had to get online with customer service and sometimes be on hold for 20 to 30 minutes and explain to them about not having mailboxes,\" Plummer said. \"They can be very difficult to reach. From now on, when I order from a big box store or anywhere else, I'm going to call or email before I order anything to figure out what shipping (service) they use.\"\n\nThis story was made available via the Colorado News Collaborative.

            "content": "For the culinary school grad, having a buzzy, semi-Instagram-famous pop-up starring her childhood-favorite comfort food had been one of those dreams that felt slightly out of reach. But when she got laid off from her fashion job in 2023, she thought, why the hell not?\n\nIn the last two and a half years, Danielle Grivet has sold hundreds of cheesy, tomato-sauce-slathered chicken parmesan sandwiches at bars across the city through her pop-up Bette\u2019s . It\u2019s mostly a solo operation, with Grivet doing prep at an off-site kitchen before loading ingredients and equipment into a Waymo or Uber (she doesn\u2019t own a car) and hustling it all over to Lark Bar, Ginger\u2019s, or House of Shields.\n\nThis is part two of the Standard\u2019s three-part series exploring the San Francisco pop-up scene, including why it offers some of the city\u2019s most exciting dining .\n\nFor talented but underresourced chefs and restaurateurs, pop-ups are an established path to getting a nascent business off the ground. The benefits are obvious: minimal overhead, ready-made exclusivity, and a low-risk way to experiment. But Grivet \u2014 and others operating some of San Francisco\u2019s best, most hyped pop-ups \u2014 have a love-hate relationship with the model. The itinerant businesses \u2014 which can draw long lines and legions of fans seeking food driven by passion over profit \u2014 require herculean efforts on the part of operators.\n\nBut despite her success \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 Grivet is thinking about winding down Bette\u2019s. She\u2019s getting weary of schlepping sandwich ingredients all over town and is waiting to hear back about an event planning job. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for me, being at this crossroads right now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I need to get back to a more stable life.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, the investment pays off; after launching as pop-ups, Four Kings and Oakland\u2019s Burdell became two of the country\u2019s hottest restaurants. But for the majority of pop-up operators, the path to sustainability is long, arduous, and nearly impossible. Often, they struggle with the question of what exactly to do with a project about which they are obsessively passionate but seems perpetually stuck in the in-between.\n\nHan says they\u2019re viewing the time at Saluhall as an opportunity to test whether committing to a permanent space is the logical next step. They\u2019ve learned to appreciate the upsides of pop-up life, including the ability to retain direct control over the quality of food and experience, preparing every burger and serving every customer. \u201cFor us, consistency matters,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s my biggest fear of scaling.\u201d\n\nSmish Smash owners Victor Donado and Amy Han have been looking for a permanent home for the business for years, but, like Grivet, are uncertain. In January, they opened an outpost in the Saluhall food court on Market Street. But even this isn\u2019t forever; it\u2019s a year-long residency.\n\nSince launching in 2020, East Bay-based pop-up Smish Smash has attracted a following for serving some of the region\u2019s best burgers. My first memory of eating one was at the Outside Lands festival in 2022, where, sitting on a patch of brown grass, I admired the thin edges of the patty, as delicate and spindly as a snowflake. It was love at first bite, but in the last three years, I managed to catch the itinerant business only a handful of times.\n\nBut even when a chef seems to have broken out of pop-up purgatory, escape isn\u2019t always clean. Max Blachman-Gentile worked as culinary director of Tartine Bakery before launching his wildly popular pizza pop-up Jules in 2023. The pop-up was always a stepping stone toward opening a proper restaurant \u2014 a marketing tool. \u201cI saw it as a means to an end,\u201d he says, which is why he could afford to invest in sometimes impractical culinary choices, like prepping three sauces \u2014 tomato, fennel cream, and mushroom cream \u2014 for a menu of just four pizzas. \u201cThe point is to get people to say, \u2018This is serious pizza,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nOperating seven days a week at the counter-service Saluhall spot means they\u2019ve had to hire staff and embrace the challenge of training and managing a team. If the staff can\u2019t maintain the current levels of quality and consistency, Han and Donado may decide to remain a pop-up once the residency ends. \u201cThis is our livelihood,\u201d Han says. \u201cThis feeds our children. So we pour our heart and soul into it.\u201d\n\nGet our editors\u2019 top restaurant picks, access to tough reservations, heads-up on new pop-ups, and more in our Off Menu weekly newsletter.\n\nPowered by his pop-up\u2019s success, Blachman-Gentile secured financial backing to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant at 237 Fillmore St. in the Lower Haight. It debuts in a few weeks. He won\u2019t go so far as to say he couldn\u2019t have done it if he hadn\u2019t launched Jules first as a pop-up but notes that many of his early investors were pop-up customers, and he landed his lease in part because his landlord had attended one of his events.\n\nSince locking down his permanent space, however, he finds himself in uncharted territory. Pop-ups benefit from the illusion of scarcity. So what happens when your product becomes available every day? Blachman-Gentile announced the upcoming restaurant in late September, then stopped doing events for several months. He began to worry he was losing momentum as he inched closer to opening day. The steady stream of new Instagram followers on the Jules account slowed noticeably.\n\nSo he planned one more pop-up at Woods Beer & Wine Co. that drew a large crowd to the typically quiet Cole Valley neighborhood on a Wednesday night.",

Not really, but you've got to call 'em how you see 'em, and there wasn't anything to grumble about on Friday night. Triple H booked a well-received title change in the main event slot, none of the matches could be considered bad (some were average, but that isn't the same as bad!), and three emotional in-ring promos raised the bar for passion, storytelling and delivery.\n\nThis was one of the most watchable editions of the broadcast since WWE took it three hours. That should be celebrated, especially coming off a hot Elimination Chamber PLE that spotlighted a shocking John Cena heel turn. That was recapped to death throughout the show, obviously, but no-one can exactly blame the company for shouting loudly about something so monumentally historic.\n\nSo, zero 'Downs' to report. A few fans might scoff at that, but it's genuinely nice to be so positive after watching one of the weeklies. Any negativity would've been forced, which is silly. Who goes into a show wanting it to be poor?! On SmackDown, both Randy Orton and Cody Rhodes hit home runs with their babyface speeches, and there was a refreshing splash of realism between Bianca Belair and Naomi before the latter dropped a bombshell.\n\nAdmittedly, most knew that was coming, but it was sweet to get there before Jade Cargill echoed Chamber by handing out another beatdown.\n\nHere's all the good and next to no bad from a fabulous evening in front of a fired up Philadelphia crowd.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUPS is increasing its fuel surcharge calculations and changing some other fees, the carrier announced on its website. Experts warn the moves will put further pressure on shippers' delivery costs.\n\nOn Monday, the company will bump up its fuel surcharge calculations by 50 basis points for its ground, air and SurePost services in the U.S.\n\nUPS adjusts its index-based fuel surcharges weekly based on the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s average on-highway diesel fuel price and the U.S. Gulf Coast jet fuel price average. Those averages determine the surcharge rate for fuel on ground and air services. Rival FedEx handles fuel surcharges the same way.\n\nAs an example of the increase's impact, if the diesel fuel index's price per gallon is $3.20, a UPS Ground or SurePost shipment will see a 17.75% markup rather than a 17.25% fee under previous calculations.\n\nThe increase builds upon the frequent fuel surcharge hikes UPS, along with FedEx, levied in 2024. Those adjustments drove the average net fuel cost for ground parcel shipments up 4.7% from Q3 to Q4, even with a decline in on-highway diesel prices, according to the TD Cowen/AFS Freight Index.\n\n\"Fuel surcharge increases impact every customer differently,\" Kenneth Moyer, partner and VP of supply chain strategies at LJM Group, said in an email to Supply Chain Dive. \"Keeping track of what it means for your business allows you to implement mitigating strategies like consolidating shipments and optimizing package dimensions and weight.\"\n\nMore fee changes from UPS are coming on March 31 \"to modernize invoices and payment options for customers,\" according to the carrier's website. Those adjustments are:\n\nA $5 fee for each printed UPS invoice copy sent to shippers or other payors.\n\nA $25 charge per payment made by check or wire transfer. The fee won't apply to Automated Clearing House payments.\n\nThe late payment fee will jump from 8% to 9.9% of the total past due invoice balance.\n\nUPS also plans to end its 2% surcharge for invoices paid by credit card on May 18. In its place, the company will add a 2% payment processing fee for each invoice.\n\nShippers should automate payments so late fees don't pile up and switch to e-invoicing and Automated Clearing House payments to avoid added charges, said Bridget Colmenares, Transportation Insight's senior director of strategic sales, on LinkedIn.\n\nThe wave of surcharge changes come amid a highly competitive parcel delivery market that is still battling soft demand. UPS and FedEx are attempting to increase their per-package revenues with added fees while attracting customers with discounted base rates.\n\n\"One reason UPS may have earmarked these payment fees for increase versus shipping rates is the blind-spot they generally inhabit for most shippers when comparing carriers,\" LJM Group's Moyer said. \"Shippers understandably tend to focus primarily on shipping charges and generally don\u2019t give these ancillary fees the attention they may merit.\"\n\nWhile FedEx hasn't announced similar fee adjustments yet, Moyer said he wouldn't be surprised if it happens in the near future.\n\n\"Because UPS announced these changes first, it gives FedEx the political cover they need to be able to match it while citing UPS as the impetus for the change,\" he said.",

Pointe Drive in Charlotte by next May. The closure will eliminate 99 positions, another hit to the facility that lost 75 jobs just last year.\n\nThe impact runs deep. Dozens of part-time workers, about twenty supervisors, and two senior managers will lose their jobs. This is the second round of major job cuts at this location in less than a year.\n\n\u201cAs mentioned during our earnings call in January, UPS is making changes to optimize our network and improve efficiency, which will include closing some facilities,\u201d said Karen Tomaszewski Hill to businessnc.com.\n\nWhile UPS earned $91.1 billion last year, they\u2019re cutting jobs across their global operations. A massive 12,000 employees worldwide will be let go as the company reduces costs.\n\nDocuments filed with North Carolina reveal the cuts come from major changes in package handling operations. While some operations might continue at the location, the long-term outlook remains uncertain.\n\nThe cuts affect both union and non-union employees. Union members can replace less senior workers, but the exact size of Charlotte\u2019s remaining workforce remains private.\n\nThere\u2019s a silver lining, some employees might find positions elsewhere in UPS. HR director Bria Woods promises support for those looking for new positions.\n\nUPS employs half a million people globally. Seventy percent are union members.\n\nThis change is part of a bigger plan. UPS wants to cut Amazon deliveries in half within two years. They\u2019re working to reduce their dependence on their largest customer.\n\nLocal officials are concerned these job losses could impact Charlotte\u2019s economy. Still, UPS says they\u2019re staying in the Queen City, just with a smaller workforce.\n\nFor affected employees, UPS is offering career transition support. Union representatives, while concerned about the future, highlight efforts to find new positions for their members.\n\nRandi Moultrie is a Charleston, South Carolina native and has been in the radio industry for the last few years in Charlotte.

You can bet UPS will have their top legal guns there. And some good Teamsters will be there, along with our allies.\n\nUPS earlier submitted a comment to treasury in which the corporation claimed that all Central States retirees should have their benefits cut the maximum extent allow by law, including UPS retirees prior to 2008, except the one group UPS has to make whole: UPSers who retired after January 1, 2008. Their reason was pure greed: bigger cuts on all those retirees would mean that UPS could save money living up to its contractual obligation to make up for the cuts imposed on post-2008 UPS retirees.\n\nUPS lobbyists got the 2014 MPRA law written to include Tier 1 (so called \u201corphans\u201d), Tier 2 (most other retirees) and Tier 3 (UPSers who retire after 2007, who the corporation has to make whole.)\n\nUPS spent $7.6 million lobbying Congress in 2014, a 36% increase over 2013. They also gave $3.1 million to political candidates, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nUPS has threatened to sue if they don\u2019t get their way through rule making, so it looks like they will be tuning up their high-priced attorneys now.\n\nThis move reeks of corporate arrogance. UPS cut a rotten deal with Hoffa and Hall in 2007 to pull its members out of the fund, which crippled the fund\u2019s income stream. They then had to offer those UPSers still working some protection from Central States\u2019s potential collapse, by agreeing to a clause in the national contract to make up the difference in any future pension cuts.\n\nNow they want to weasel out of the deal they signed. And in the process they are demanding that UPS Teamsters who retired prior to 2008 get cut even more than the 50 % cut that Central States has proposed.",

Photo by John Ciccarelli/U.S. Air Force\n\nMarch 7 (UPI) -- Contrary to commonly held beliefs, current research shows that cutting out certain foods makes little difference in controlling the skin disease eczema, a renowned U.S. dermatologist said Friday. The latest probes into the complex links between diet, food allergies and eczema -- also known as atopic dermatitis -- reveal eczema may be better controlled or even prevented by building up tolerances to allergenic foods at an early age, according to Dr. Peter Lio, a dermatology and pediatrics professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Advertisement\n\nLio is a keynote speaker at this year's American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting, which began Friday in Orlando. During the gathering he said he will assemble and present the latest thinking on the long-controversial subject of how foodstuffs and food allergies interact with atopic dermatitis.\n\nEczema is a chronic disease that usually begins in childhood in which the skin becomes extremely itchy. Scratching it can lead to further redness, swelling, cracking, \"weeping\" clear fluid, crusting and scaling, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany sufferers have flare-ups in which the symptoms worsen, followed by periods when the skin improves or clears up entirely, called remissions.\n\nWhat causes eczema remains unknown, although links have been found connecting it to genetics, the immune system and the environment. But just how diet and food allergies interact with eczema remains a mystery after nearly two centuries of medical debate.\n\nWhile younger children with atopic dermatitis typically exhibit sensitivity to food items like peanuts, milk or eggs, strict \"elimination diets\" have not proven to be particularly effective at controlling the disease in a vast majority of cases.\n\nAmong Lio's key points at the Orlando conference is that recent studies generally refute long-held \"common sense\" beliefs held by many eczema sufferers that their conditions must somehow be related to what they eat.\n\n\"Many patients and families start the visit by explaining that they are convinced that food must be the 'root cause' of their eczema. It would be fantastic -- and easy -- if it were just food causing the eczema. But, in my experience, and more importantly, when carefully reviewing the literature, we find that this very rarely the case,\" he told UPI in emailed comments.\n\nAnd yet, food allergies do indeed appear be associated with eczema -- but maybe just not in the way commonly believed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are very often \"real, dangerous food allergies associated with atopic dermatitis,\" Lio said. \"Things like peanut allergy, shellfish allergy, and milk allergy are all much more common for patients with eczema and can even be life threatening. So, eczema and food allergy are clearly related, it just seems that the arrow of causality was pointing in the wrong direction.\"\n\nRather than diet causing a reaction, new research suggests it might actually be allergens \"leaking\" through damaged skin and into the body that triggers eczema and compromises the immune system.\n\nAnd, if a \"leaky\" skin barrier is the culprit, then it may be wiser for parents to introduce children to peanuts and other potentially allergenic foods at an early age to help \"teach\" their immune systems to tolerate them, Lio said.\n\n\"The guidance around when to eat allergic foods has flipped 180 degrees: where there used to be guidance asking patients and families to hold off on allergic foods such as peanuts, we have now seen the guidelines encourage eating those foods as early as safely possible,\" he said. \"This has been incredibly exciting to see.\"\n\nIn fact, last year a study supported by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases found that feeding children peanut products regularly from infancy to age 5 reduced the rate of peanut allergy in adolescence by 71%, even when the children ate or avoided peanut products as desired for many years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose results came nine years after the landmark Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, study determined that the introduction of peanut at age 4 to 11 months in infants with severe eczema reduced the risk of peanut allergy by more than 80% compared with peanut avoidance.\n\nThe findings \"should reinforce parents' and caregivers' confidence that feeding their young children peanut products beginning in infancy according to established guidelines can provide lasting protection from peanut allergy,\" NIAID Director Jeanne Marrazzo said in May.\n\nThe mounting evidence that many, if not most, cases of peanut allergies could be prevented indeed represents a \"shift in approach [that] could have lifelong benefits for those infants and their families as well as begin to curb the growing epidemic of food allergy in the U.S. and other parts of the world,\" said Sung Poblete, CEO of Food Allergy Research & Education, a nonprofit group dedicated to food allergy awareness, research, education and advocacy.\n\nEczema, he told UPI, is \"more than a skin condition\" in that it can serve as an \"early warning sign of food allergy, can help identify high-risk infants who may benefit from early, frequent exposure to peanut-containing foods, as demonstrated by the LEAP study.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvidence shows that as many as 81% of peanut allergy cases can be prevented, Poblete noted, adding, \"It is more important than ever that parents, primary care providers, pediatricians, and dermatologists understand the potential implications of eczema so that they can guide families toward preventive care where appropriate.\"\n\nFARE this month released a public service announcement called Eat Early, Eat Often that introduces new parents to the recommendations that came from the LEAP study, urging that a \"few spoonfuls of infant-safe peanut foods today could mean a lifetime of worry-free eating tomorrow.\"",

            "content": "Are the stem cells that form our blood and immune systems dictating the course of autoimmune disease? New research raises the possibility, suggesting that memories held within blood stem cells may trigger the often-disabling symptoms of autoimmune disease that flare up over a person\u2019s lifetime.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking \u2018under the hood\u2019 of the most powerful immune cells we have, and they are ones we never talk about in autoimmune disease,\u201d said Eric Pietras, PhD, associate professor of medicine-hematology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that activation of disease flares might not just be about immune cells. The blood stem cells \u2013 the cells that give rise to all the immune cells in the body for an entire lifetime \u2013 may also be critical players in the process.\u201d\n\nPietras believes the findings from his latest study may revolutionize how we think about all diseases.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re learning is that blood stem cells are not just the genetic blueprint for the immune system as we previously thought. They\u2019re also the functional blueprint for the immune system.\u201d\n\nHis team is beginning to gather evidence from patients that could determine whether autoimmune disease can become encoded in the blood stem cells. By understanding where the disease originates, as well as the evolving process that links metabolic fuels used by immune cells with the inflammatory response, his lab\u2019s work has the potential to unlock new treatments.\n\nWhen the immune system attacks healthy cells\n\nThe incidence of autoimmune disease is growing, with estimates of 24-50 million people in the United States affected by one of the more than 100 types, from multiple sclerosis to rheumatoid arthritis. It\u2019s characterized by the body\u2019s immune system attacking itself, targeting specific tissues or even multiple organs. Autoimmune disease is typically a life sentence and damaging to quality of life.\n\nPatients with autoimmune disease traditionally have been treated with a \u201csledgehammer\u201d approach \u2013 powerful drugs such as steroids that suppress the immune system. Today, therapies such as biologics offer a more targeted option. But the challenge with autoimmunity is that it's a lifelong disease with a remitting-relapsing course. Over their lifetimes, even people on therapy can experience disease flare-ups that feel as bad, if not worse, than when they were first diagnosed.\n\n\u201cWhat previous studies taught us is that there was an immunological memory that we didn't know about. And that immunological memory was actually not specific to the antigens the vaccine induced for these T cells to remember.\" \u2013 Eric Pietras, PhD\n\nThe question plaguing immunologists\n\nPietras and his team started with a question that the immunology field has been grappling with for years: How does the immune system \"remember\" to develop a flare (an outburst of autoimmunity that triggers symptoms of the particular disease)? The researchers aimed to understand how the body retains immunological memory that allows flares to reactivate over time.\n\nUsing animal models, the scientists set out with a chief goal of understanding how blood stem cells \u2013 the master cells that give rise to the immune system \u2013 participate in the development of disease. They transplanted blood stem cells from mice with an autoimmune condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) into healthy mice. They then examined the macrophages (a type of white blood cell that activates immune responses) emerging from those stem cells.\n\nThe immune system of the mice that received the SLE blood stem cells were reprogrammed toward a hyper-inflammatory state with different metabolic features than the immune cells from a normal mouse.\n\nHow cells hold \u2018memory\u2019 and impact immunity\n\nPietras used vaccines as an example of how certain types of immune cells can hold a memory and influence the rest of the immune system, specifically the body\u2019s chief fighter cells, or T cells. A vaccine introduces a weakened pathogen or its component parts into the body, triggering the immune system to attack that specific foreign invader, while also boosting its \u201cfighter\u201d response to other, unrelated pathogens.\n\n\u201cWhat previous studies taught us is that there was an immunological memory that we didn't know about. And that immunological memory was actually not specific to the antigens the vaccine induced for these T cells to remember,\u201d Pietras said.\n\n\u201cIt was another part of the immune system that was functioning to create this memory. And what we learned is that the other types of white blood cells, known as myeloid cells, seem to be the critical partners here. In our SLE experiments, these cells retained a memory of the disease that helped to turn up inflammation and T cell immunity more than normal myeloid cells.\u201d\n\nPietras said it\u2019s key to understand that myeloid cells don\u2019t last forever. Considering how autoimmune disease is long-term, he then posed the question: How is it that autoimmune inflammation lasts longer than the lifetime of an individual cell?\n\nIt suggests that the source of the memory might be the longest living immune cells in the body \u2013 the stem cells that build the entire blood system, including every immune cell.\n\nThe metabolism/inflammatory response relationship\n\nAutoimmune disease occurs when the immune system malfunctions. When the immune system is operating correctly, infections in the body change the metabolic state of the immune system to encourage it to respond. In most cases, this response is protective. But in cases of autoimmune disease, it can be harmful.\n\nWhen Pietras used a mouse model to block the autoimmune cells from being able to access energy (glucose), the inflammatory response was lessened.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw is that you can actually turn down the autoimmune activity of those cell populations by not allowing them access to energy, suggesting that autoimmunity, in part, is driven by where energy comes from and how it\u2019s used,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Pietras, this means it\u2019s important to understand how the metabolic state of the stem cell changes over time. He believes that because blood stem cells exist over many years, metabolic changes in the stem cells themselves could be the trigger for the autoimmune response.\n\nBecause metabolic states are highly changeable, Pietras said it\u2019s possible they are influenced by epigenetic changes (changes that are inherited by cells without rewriting their DNA code). \u201cWe think epigenetic changes are crucial for transmitting autoimmune traits across generations of immune cells over time.\u201d\n\nGiven that epigenetic-modifying drugs exist, could it mean the collection of epigenetic marks on the cells could be modified? Pietras said they are still learning what might be useful in this context. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know how exactly the new memory \u2018code\u2019 gets written into stem cells and changes how the immune system behaves.\u201d\n\nPietras cautioned that while the study opens new doors for research, it\u2019s not understood how an autoimmune condition affects the evolution of blood stem cells, how inflammation impacts the longevity of epigenetic changes and whether these changes persist in the long term.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important priorities right now is to look at patients and understand previously underappreciated data, including how patients with autoimmune disease do over time. The really important next step is to try to determine if we can find what we\u2019ve seen in our models in the blood stem cells of autoimmune patients,\u201d Pietras said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nUPS-owned Happy Returns saw 40% faster processing speeds at its three hubs during peak season compared to previous years, the company announced last month. The acceleration allowed the company to ship returns to retailers faster for inventory restocking.\n\nAutomation replacing manual processes at the locations primarily drove the faster processing speeds, COO Tim Fehr said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive. The main automation component of those hubs are Geek+ sorting robots, which were installed last year.\n\n\"We were very focused on having the entire network automated before peak so we could achieve those results,\" Fehr said.\n\nThe returns provider is planning for further automation advancements at its facilities this year, according to Fehr. While he didn't specify what those upgrades would be, Happy Returns' announcement offered a hunt about its next moves.\n\n\"We're exploring new types of robotic automation to handle higher volumes more efficiently and reduce the physical strain on warehouse workers \u2014 including the potential use of robotic systems for unloading trucks to further streamline operations,\" Happy Returns said in the announcement.\n\nBeyond automation, Happy Returns' speeds have also benefited from earlier UPS delivery times to its facilities. Fehr said it worked with various industrial engineering groups at its parent company to receive returns around 8 a.m. or 8:30 a.m., compared to previous times of noon to 1 p.m.\n\nThe additional hours give Happy Returns a larger window to process those returns for outbound shipping in the afternoon, typically to the facilities where the order originally was fulfilled from, Fehr said.\n\n\"We're getting more stuff outbound, and we continue to work with UPS on that, and I think we can get even earlier delivery times,\" he said.\n\nAs the number of returns Happy Returns handles grows, the company will lean on automation to more efficiently use space at its facilities in Pennsylvania, California and Mississippi, Fehr said. Happy Returns is satisfied with the three-hub footprint, as it is already able to meet retailers' needs with the existing footprint, he added.",

The U.S. Postal Service's contract with UPS SurePost ended at the start of the new year, causing confusion for residents who had UPS delivering packages to U.S. Postal Service post offices.\n\nRyan Spencer/Summit Daily News\n\nColorado mountain residents are reporting that the end of a contract between the U.S. Postal Service and UPS has led to many packages being returned to sender and continued confusion about how to get packages delivered.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service\u2019s contract with UPS SurePost \u2014 the company\u2019s economy shipping option \u2014 ended at the beginning of January. Residents soon learned, usually because their packages failed to arrive, that the change meant UPS would no longer deliver to P.O. boxes at U.S. post offices.\n\nThis has created a dilemma for many mountain residents, since the U.S. Postal Service won\u2019t deliver packages to most physical addresses. Yet when shopping online, residents say it\u2019s not easy to tell whether a vendor is sending a package via the U.S. Postal Service, UPS or another delivery company.\n\nUnder the now-expired contract, UPS was previously able to drop off packages at U.S. post offices for \u201clast-mile delivery,\u201d where residents with P.O. boxes could pick them up.\n\nBut since the contract ended, packages have been returned to sender, causing confusion about how to get parcels delivered in the mountains.\n\nU.S. Postal Service response\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service said in a statement that it has been working to implement a \u201cnew strategic approach\u201d with its contracts with package consolidator companies, such as UPS, that use its Parcel Select service for high voluming shipping \u2014 including negotiating new agreements.\n\n\u201cPrior agreements failed to reflect operational and financial realities, the evolving postal network or the enhancements to our portfolio of product offerings,\u201d the U.S. Postal Service said in the statement. \u201cAs a result of our new approach, some businesses negotiated new agreements with us and some have not.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Service did not respond to questions regarding what the end of the contract with UPS SurePost means for those with P.O. boxes or how the changes could impact delivery in rural communities such as Grand County.\n\nUPS also did not respond to questions about changes to its SurePost program, how customers a with P.O. box would be affected or the best way for customers to ensure that their mail reaches them.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service said in its statement that it has maintained transparency throughout its \u201cnew strategic approach\u201d and will continue to communicate \u201copenly and transparently\u201d moving forward.\n\n\u201cThroughout this process we have been transparent \u2014 both publicly and privately \u2014 with business partners, customers and the shipping industry about our intent to either negotiate new agreements or to let prior disadvantageous agreements expire,\u201d the U.S. Postal Service statement said. \u201cCommunications to affected businesses began in the spring of 2024 with multiple, follow-up public announcements made through the end of the year. How these aggregating businesses have communicated about these developments to their stakeholders is beyond the control or responsibility of the Postal Service.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Michael Bennet said in a statement that he \u201ccontinues to advocate that USPS prioritize excellent customer service in its operations and is deeply concerned by reports that President Trump plans to privatize the (Postal Service) or remove the board of governors.\u201d",

In prelims, swimmers qualify for one of two finals heats: the top 8 finishers make the A final, places 9 through 16 the B final. In finals, swimmers are locked into their respective final, meaning a swimmer in the B heat (spots 9-16) can only place as high as 9th or as low as 16th, even if they put up the fastest or slowest time of any heat in the final.\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ll be tracking \u201cUps\u201d and \u201cDowns\u201d after each prelims session. \u201cUp\u201d refers to swimmers and divers in the A final, \u201cDown\u201d to B finalists.\n\nWomen\u2019s Meet\n\nWomen\u2019s Top 10 After Day 1\n\nKeiser 80 Lindsey Wilson 68 Cumberlands 60 Bethel (IN) 54 Olivet Nazarene 48 SCAD 46 Union Commonwealth / Milligan 42 \u2013 Indiana Wesleyan 36 St Thomas / St Ambrose 30\n\nSt Thomas had a big morning on Thursday in Elkhart, beating their psych sheet seedings by 25.5 points with more finalists than expected in all three individual swimming events.

Drummond was the owner of , a recording studio and cell phone repair shop in Lantana, that authorities found as operating as a front for selling stolen merchandise.\n\nPrevious reports say PBSO's investigation began in October after UPS representatives reached out to them, claiming that T-Mobile had recognized they were losing thousands of dollars from two Lake Worth locations, which began in July 2024. The losses amounted to over $504,000.\n\nAccording to the probable cause affidavit, T-Mobile's internal investigation led them to trace the stolen goods back to California by placing GPS tracking devices in the packages they believed were being stolen.\n\nSee also:\n\nThrough the investigation, detectives learned that Griffon White was a UPS supervisor and managed delivering the stolen packages to the recording studio.\n\nSheldon Brown was the UPS delivery driver who was in charge of removing the stolen packages from the shipping facility and giving them to White and Christopher Palmer. Additionally, Palmer was a UPS driver who received the stolen packages from Brown and was, at the time of his arrest, using one of the stolen phones from the stolen packages.\n\nOn February 25, detectives executed four arrest warrants and a search warrant at GoalMind Studios.\n\nAs of February 25, the total documented loss to T-Mobile stands at approximately $269,036 in which PBSO detectives identified 16 specific thefts of T-Mobile packages from a UPS hub located at 2001 Avenue P in Riviera Beach.\n\nBrown, White, and Palmer all face charges, including Conspiracy to Commit Racketeering, Grand Theft over $100,000, Organized Scheme to Defraud Over $50,000, Dealing in Stolen Property, and Unlawful Use of a Two-way Communication Device.\n\nAccording to PBSO, Drummond faces counts of larceny, fraud, dealing in stolen property and use of a two-way communication device to commit a felony.\n\nFind more ways to stay up to date with your latest local news. to get the day's top headlines delivered right to your inbox. for the biggest stories and can't miss video.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "I first learned to appreciate warm-ups because of Michigan hoops. The football culture at that school was intense to the point where I had multiple panic attacks in that gigantic stadium, but the basketball arena felt something like home. If you got there early enough, on the one or two times a week that the men's team would play, you could sit right behind the bench, practically on the floor. I liked it so much more than football, not only because of the decreased BAC and ambient hysteria but also for the way you could see the athletes as real people\u2014your peers, really\u2014and not just maize and blue gladiators. With the pep band playing familiar tunes\u2014\"I Want You Back\" and \"You Can Call Me Al\" and so on\u2014I could get lost in their preparations: the careful stretching-out of recent injuries, the slightly forbidden thrill of attempting a showy dunk or an ultra-long-range shot, the choreography of staff members each with their own small role to play, even if it was just fetching rebounds. It was an almost meditative way to settle in before the emotional stress to come.\n\nI still make a point of arriving early enough to catch warm-ups\u2014especially when I'm watching hockey, where the beauty of the skate-around a half-hour before the advertised start time carries the warmth of a religious ritual. On Tuesday, as the New York Islanders hosted the Winnipeg Jets, I was one of a very few in position to enjoy this routine\u2014the lack of fans symbolic of an uninspiring season. But the empty seats did not portend a desolate night.\n\nIn fact, I had a lovely time taking a friend to her first-ever hockey experience, as the Isles held on for a 3-2 upset that saw their captain Anders Lee get into a fight (well, he got punched a lot) before earning the primary assist on the game-winning goal. The 60 minutes of the actual game made for worthy entertainment, but to me, the experience starts in that time before the Zambonis roll out to prep the ice for puck drop. The warm-ups are the moment when I reacquaint myself with guys I almost exclusively know as two-dimensional television sprites, like when Jets star Kyle Connor zoomed by the blue line with his helmet off and then zig-zagged his way toward the net for a shot. It's a soothing mix of structure and low-stakes improvisation, watching, say Maxim Tsyplakov and then Anthony Duclair take turns approaching goal and putting pucks off Ilya Sorokin's pads. And it's a time when the spotlight doesn't particularly favor any one player; if you're a Casey Cizikas fan, like I am, it's a rare chance to see him on a breakaway, of sorts.\n\nIt's an uncommon privilege, witnessing unfiltered the work that goes into the real show. You can't go watch a massive rock band rehearse in a studio. You don't get to see actors test out their voices before a play, or the raw footage of a movie before the lights dim. You don't see a writer's fragments and outlines before reading the finished product, nor a painter's first tries before her canvas arrives in a museum. The closest example I can call to mind is the cacophony of sound that precedes an orchestra performance, and while I do like that as a sort of aural appetizer, those disparate, individualized scales bear little connection to the tightly constructed pieces that follow.\n\nI've been on the other side of it, down there on the floor, and what I think was especially nice about pregame layup lines when I played basketball is that it was the only time in the whole night when every one of your teammates was out there together, with no separation by skill. The warm-ups contain all the joy of collaborative movement and exercise with none of the stress of competition, and absent those pressures, they're a ripe time for connection. I still have a vivid image of the warm-ups for an MLS All-Star Game I went to in Philly, where David Luiz would playfully flick the ear of the young kids on Chelsea when they couldn't manage to keep the dribbling drill going. My earliest memory of live hockey is Darren McCarty tossing pucks over the glass to eager fans. And I think about how Stef Dolson solidified her spot as my favorite then\u2013Liberty player when she remained engaged and encouraging during warm-ups, even as she was forced out of action by injury. All of these things matter as much as any play that officially counts.",

            "content": "Because U-6 is a wider definition of unemployment, it therefore usually reports a higher unemployment rate than U-3. From Jan 1994 to January 2025, the premium of U-6 to U-3 ranged from 1.55 to 2.06, with an average ratio of 1.83, implying the U-6 rate tends to be about 80% greater than the U-3 unemployment rate. From September 2014 to March 2020, the ratio was around 2.0.\n\nThe difference between the two unemployment rates is evidenced in the spread between the two indices in Figures 3, 4, & 5. For example, during the financial crisis, U-3 peaked at 10% in October 2009. However, that same month, U-6 reported 17.1% and peaked at 17.2% in December 2009. During COVID-19 in April 2020, U-3 peaked at 14.8% while U-6 reached a maximum of 22.9%.\n\nThe behavior of U-3 and U-6 is noted in Figure 3. When unemployment moves higher, U-6 tends to accelerate faster than U-3, causing the spread of the two metrics to widen. This suggests more activity is occurring in various labor market segments other than that U-3 describes.\n\nDuring moments of a tight labor market such as April 2023, U-6 and U-3 declined to 6.6% and 3.4%, respectively, equating to a spread of 3.2. In April 2000, U-6 and U-3 bottomed at 6.9% and 3.8%, respectively, with a spread of 3.1. Since the introduction of U-6 in 1994, only once did the spread narrow to 2.9, in October 2000.\n\nAfter the financial crisis, it took several years for both the spread and unemployment rates to return to pre-crisis levels. This would imply the labor market may have been hit harder than assumed.",

            "content": "Cognitive impairment in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a host of health problems, new research shows. The connections between kidney and brain health are actively being investigated. What\u2019s becoming clear is that even children and younger adults with CKD are at risk, as are patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). There is a pressing need to conduct more research in this area and discover workable solutions.\n\nAdverse Outcomes\n\nAmong more than a half million patients with stage 3-5 CKD in the TriNetX database, investigators propensity-score matched 8184 patients who had pre-existing cognitive impairment (ie, vascular dementia, Alzheimer disease, and mild cognitive impairment) up to 5 years before their CKD diagnosis and 8184 patients who did not.\n\nAt 10 years after CKD diagnosis, all-cause mortality occurred in a significantly higher proportion of the group with vs without cognitive impairment: 18.5% vs 12.6%, Lino Merlino, a PhD student at the University of Manchester in the UK, and colleagues reported in Clinical Kidney Journal.1 The cognitive impairment group had a significant 63% increased risk for early death.\n\nCognitively impaired patients also had significantly higher rates of cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs 6.9%), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (2.7% vs 1.6%), arrhythmia (14.5% vs 13.3%), hypotension (16.5% vs 12.5%), and AKI (19.5% vs 17.0%).\n\nWith respect to neurologic and psychiatric conditions, the cognitive impairment group more frequently displayed encephalopathy (9.9% vs 5.0%), mood disorders (13.6% vs 9.7%), psychosis (9.8% vs 4.6%), and epilepsy (4.3% vs 1.5%). They were more likely to take antidepressants (26.3% vs 16.3%), anticonvulsants (19.5% vs 15.1%), antipsychotics (18.6% vs 9.1%), anticholinesterase (5.6% vs 0.1%), and benzodiazepines (30.6% vs 26.6%).\n\nPartly due to poor self-care, cognitively impaired patients had higher rates of malnutrition (6.7% vs 4.0%), urinary infections (13.2% vs 9.3%), and pneumonia (10.7% vs 7.9%).\n\nAccording to Merlino\u2019s team, \u201cmost research has centered on older patients or those approaching dialysis, leaving a gap in understanding the cumulative risk associated with [cognitive impairment] in younger patients with milder CKD.\u201d\n\nThis study, they added, addresses this gap, demonstrating that even a short history of cognitive impairment can increase death risk by nearly 50% in younger adult patients (mean age 60.5 years) with milder CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 52.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) in a 2-year time frame.\n\nThe investigators noted the close connections between kidney and brain health. Brain damage, for example, may affect kidney function. Shared genetic pathways influence both the onset of CKD and cognitive impairment, particularly genes related to vascular health, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the renin-angiotensin system. In addition, some risk factors such as aging, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension are common to both conditions.\n\n\u201cThe study underscores the importance of a comprehensive cognitive assessment in CKD patients to identify the most vulnerable cohort at the earliest possible stage,\u201d Merlino\u2019s team wrote.\n\nThey also observed: \u201cNephrologists must increase their confidence in managing therapies linked to cognitive decline in the context of CKD, and cooperation with psychiatry or neurology specialists should be encouraged to guarantee better care and quality of life in patients with CKD.\u201d\n\nKidney-Brain Connections\n\nIn a study published in Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia that included 15,897 adults aged 40-69 years from the CARTaGENE cohort, lower eGFR was specifically associated with reduced reasoning and memory performance and slower reaction times, which influence attention and executive functions.2 Brain regions associated with eGFR were enriched for mitochondrial and inflammatory-related genes and correlated with changes in brain structure observable on MRI.\n\n\u201cNotably, eGFR mediated the relationship between reasoning and brain morphology,\u201d Shady Rahayel, PsyD PhD, of H\u00f4pital du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Montr\u00e9al in Quebec, Canada, and colleagues wrote. \u201cImaging transcriptomic analysis revealed that lower eGFR was associated with transcriptomic patterns resembling those seen in tauopathies and synucleinopathies.\u201d\n\nMidlife Adults and Children Affected\n\nIn a study of 22,435 Black and White adults aged 45 years and older who were free from cognitive impairment at baseline, the odds of later experiencing cognitive impairment were significantly increased 90% at midlife (aged 45 years or more but less than 65 years) for those with an eGFR less than 45 vs 90 mL/min/1.73m2 or more, investigators reported in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.3 Midlife patients with albuminuria had steeper declines in memory function. A previous study published in Scientific Reports likewise concluded that patients with CKD at midlife were at risk.\n\nEven children and adolescents with CKD appear at risk for cognitive impairment, Lyndsay Harshman, MD, of the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, and colleagues reported in JAMA Network Open.4 In a comparison of 37 patients with CKD and 87 healthy patients aged 6 to 21 years, the CKD group had worse age-related changes in cerebellar gray matter (\u03b2 = -0.10) and white matter (\u03b2 = -0.09). The findings point to abnormal growth trajectories of the cerebellum in pediatric CKD, even before dialysis or transplantation. Further, lower cerebellum volume correlated with lower kidney function and executive functioning deficits, such as attention regulation and planning. The investigators also found a negative association between amygdala volume and monitoring, another executive function component. Executive function worsens with longer CKD duration and the development of metabolic acidosis and hypertension. The investigators acknowledged that even isolated congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract may affect brain development.\n\nAcute Kidney Injury and Cognitive Impairment\n\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) can also contribute to dementia, data suggest. Among 8148 older adults at high cardiovascular risk in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), the risk for probable dementia and a composite of mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia was significantly increased 72% and 43%, respectively, for those with vs without AKI, Kristen L. Nowak, PhD, MPH, of the University of Colorado at Aurora, and colleagues reported in Kidney Medicine.5 AKI was generally mild and reversible in SPRINT, the investigators noted. The most common AKI causes were dehydration and/or intravascular volume depletion, followed by hypotension. CKD was present in 28% of the cohort.\n\n\u201cIt is plausible that a bout of inflammatory stimuli from AKI increases the risk of [mild cognitive impairment] and dementia years later, rather than via progression of AKI to CKD increasing risk of adverse cardiovascular endpoints,\u201d according to Dr Nowak\u2019s team. They urged monitoring of cognitive function after AKI in this patient population.\n\nCognitive Impairment in Dialysis Population\n\nDialysis-dependent patients have twice the risk of cognitive impairment compared with the age-matched general population, LaTonya J. Hickson, MD, of Mayo Clinic Nephrology and Hypertension in Jacksonville, Florida, and colleagues pointed out in a review article published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.10 Lower kidney clearance of uremic toxins is associated with worse performance on cognitive measures. Indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate are the most commonly studied, but there are many others.\n\nPotential therapeutic interventions for the dialysis population under investigation include AST-120 [indoxyl sulfate absorbent], CH-223191 [aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist], TRAM34 [Kca3.1-specific inhibitor], anakinra [IL-1R inhibitor], marimastat, exercise, supplements, and kidney transplantation, according to the authors.\n\nResearch Priorities\n\nClara Bohm, MD, MPH, and colleagues convened panels of researchers, clinicians, and patients who identified 27 critical research questions about cognition in CKD. The top questions by consensus centered on preventing cognitive impairment and maintaining cognition in patients, including those on dialysis and children. Panelists also wondered whether clearance of uremic toxins via hemodialysis reduces the risk of impaired cognition. Dialysis is ineffective at removing larger, protein-bound metabolites such as phosphate and indoxyl sulfate implicated in cognitive impairment, the authors noted in Kidney360.6 They also pointed out that kidney transplantation is not an option for everyone.\n\nIn the Journal of Nephrology, Carmine Zoccali, MD, of Renal Research Institute in New York, New York, and colleagues urged dedicated research on genetic markers of cognitive dysfunction and dementia in CKD.7 According to the current literature, genetic markers that may be relevant to the CKD population include apolipoprotein E (APOE; a known risk factor for Alzheimer disease), complement receptor 1 (CR1), clusterin (CLU), sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These genes play roles in lipid metabolism, inflammation, A\u03b2 clearance, and neuronal function, and have been associated with cognitive dysfunction and dementia in other populations.\n\nInterventions\n\nA small study published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine found that cognitive impairment was tied to a greater likelihood of a sedentary lifestyle both in patients on dialysis (88% vs 48% without cognitive impairment) and kidney transplant recipients (45% vs 9%).8\n\nA separate trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: ACTRN12618000851268) tested lifestyle modifications to prevent cognitive impairment in adults without CKD. In the trial, investigators randomly assigned 6104 dementia-free Australians aged 55-77 years with modifiable dementia risk factors to online coaching targeting physical activity, nutrition via a Mediterranean diet, cognitive activity and depression or anxiety (Maintain Your Brain program) or to a control group that received education only. Approximately a third had baseline hypertension, and less than half had high cholesterol. One in 5 had a history of depression and/or anxiety.\n\nAt 3 years, global cognitive composite z scores increased more in the intervention than control group: 0.28 vs 0.10, Henry Brodaty, MB BS, DSc, director of the Dementia Centre for Research Collaboration and co-director of the Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing at UNSW Sydney in New South Wales, Australia, and colleagues reported in Nature Medicine.9 Complex attention (0.16), executive function (0.07), and learning and memory (0.19) domain scores also increased significantly more in the intervention group.\n\nThe intervention group had higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet, more minutes of moderate to high-intensity aerobic training per week, 1 more day of strength training per week, and less psychological distress as measured by Kessler Psychological Distress Scale.\n\nThe Mind Your Brain program modestly lowered prospective dementia risk based on the ANU-ADRI-SF11 score by 0.53. Greater engagement and adherence were associated with better cognitive outcomes. Whether these results would extend to patients with CKD remains to be seen.\n\nTrial-related adverse event rates were very low but affected more of the intervention group: 0.60% vs 0.03%.\n\n\u201cAs these interventions can be conducted unsupervised through a web-based application, it has the potential to provide a realistic path toward community-based interventions for older people,\u201d Dr Brodaty\u2019s team wrote.\n\nDisclosure: Please see the original references for a full list of authors\u2019 disclosures.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Danica Lombardozzi.\n\nThe overall amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing, a clear trend linked to human activities and climate change. Less concerning but more mysterious, the difference between the highest and lowest amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere each year has also been increasing.\n\nThis widening disparity between carbon dioxide peaks and dips was thought to be caused by warming temperatures and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but a new study led by Colorado State University has found that agriculture is the primary cause of seasonal carbon cycle swings. This discovery adds to scientific understanding of the carbon cycle and could help inform climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nThe findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nWhile climate and carbon dioxide concentrations do contribute to annual carbon cycle highs and lows, the research found that agricultural nitrogen fertilizer is the biggest contributor to fluctuations, highlighting the impact of human actions and land management decisions on Earth system processes.\n\n\"These findings are important because we have undervalued the role of agriculture in carbon cycle fluxes,\" said lead author Danica Lombardozzi, an assistant professor of ecosystem science and sustainability. \"A lot of people recognize that agriculture can help mitigate climate change, but because it's not represented in most Earth system models, it's not considered in climate change projections the way it should be.\"\n\nAnnual carbon cycle fluctuations indicate how much the biosphere is growing every year, Lombardozzi explained. As plants grow in the spring, they draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After crops are harvested and other plants go dormant in the fall, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases. Plants need nitrogen to absorb carbon dioxide and grow. Most crops around the world are fertilized with nitrogen, which is necessary for food production and causes more carbon to be drawn from the atmosphere to fuel greater growth.\n\nThe study found that agricultural nitrogen is responsible for 45% of the fluctuation increase in the annual carbon cycle. More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and warmer temperatures contribute 40% and 18%, respectively.\n\nThe increasing fluctuation driven by crops doesn't necessarily impact carbon storage, Lombardozzi said, because crops are harvested every year and the carbon they absorb is returned to the atmosphere. However, agricultural management can be adapted to store more carbon in the soil in the long term, which would help to mitigate climate change.\n\n\"Agricultural management practices are very important to shaping the world we live in,\" said co-author Gretchen Keppel-Aleks, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan. \"At a time when many people feel like climate change has had profound and negative impacts on their lives through wildfires, flooding or droughts, we can use the fact that this study shows that agricultural management has a profound impact on carbon fluxes to think about how we can use agricultural management to our advantage.\"\n\nGuided by emerging science, many farmers are adopting practices collectively known as regenerative agriculture to improve soil health and crop production while also mitigating climate change.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Lombardozzi and her co-authors used the Community Earth System Model, developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in collaboration with researchers from other institutions, to quantify the sources causing the fluctuation increase and discover that agricultural nitrogen is the most significant factor.\n\nAll Earth system models are complex because they encompass global atmospheric, land and ocean processes, including chemistry, biology and physics for the entire planet. The Community Earth System Model is unique because it also incorporates agricultural processes.\n\nLombardozzi said that Earth system models must represent agriculture, in particular agricultural nitrogen, to accurately assess the carbon cycle, but most of them currently do not.\n\n\"It is really hard to represent human decisions in an Earth system model, but we need to tackle it,\" she said.\n\nMore information: Danica L.

This was driven by a combination of a 4.3% fall in rate of sale and a 1.0% drop in distribution points.\n\nThe report highlights the key role of chain restaurants in wine in the US On Premise. While chains account for 15% of all wine outlets, they generate 23% of total sales\u2014giving them a significantly higher rate of sale than independent venues. However, total volumes and rate of sale fell slightly faster in chains than the market as a whole in 2024.\n\nCGA\u2019s exclusive sales measurement solution also pinpoints state-by-state variations in chains\u2019 wine performance, enabling suppliers to precision-target locations. California was comfortably the best performing state in 2024, gaining just over 2 percentage points of volume share year-on-year. Texas and Arizona were among other states stealing share.\n\nin chain restaurants. Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon both increased their share of total wine sales by value by 0.5 percentage points year-on-year. These two varietals now command 13.6% and 17.4% shares of the market respectively.\n\n\n\nMatthew Crompton, CGA by NIQ\u2019s Vice-President: On Premise-Americas, said: \u201cWith wine volumes under pressure and mounting challenges from other categories, it is more crucial than ever for wine suppliers and venues to identify areas of potential. We are sure to see further change in engagement patterns from state to state and varietal to varietal in 2025, so businesses will need to stay on top of trends and target the right locations with the right portfolios. Giving consumers exactly what they want will be key to reviving growth.\u201d\n\nCGA by NIQ\u2019s On Premise Impact Reports help suppliers and manufacturers across food and beverage keep a pulse on the industry, delivering expert and up-to-the-minute insights derived from a variety of our best-in-class data tools.

            "content": "Trump ups tariffs, promises more; farm groups fret Published 11:49 am Tuesday, March 4, 2025\n\nPresident Trump raised tariffs on the top three foreign destinations for U.S. farm goods, telling farmers to get ready to make a lot of agricultural products to sell inside the U.S.\n\nTariffs of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products went into effect early March 4. Additional 10% tariffs on Chinese products also took effect.\n\nCanada and China immediately slapped tariffs on some U.S. goods. Agriculture was a prime target as both countries retaliated. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country will respond on March 9.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau and National Farmers Union issued statements warning that trade wars will hurt farmers. In a post on Social Truth, Trump reassured farmers he has their interests in mind.\n\nThe president said he planned to adopt \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on other counties April 2. The U.S. imported $195.6 billion in agricultural products in 2023, while exporting $178.7 billion in 2023, according to the USDA Economic Research Service. USDA attributed the farm trade deficit to a strong dollar and demand for year-round produce.\n\n\u201cTo the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural products to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external products on April 2nd. Have fun!\u201d Trump posted.\n\nCombined, China, Canada and Mexico buy close to half of all U.S. farm exports. In the other direction, Canada supplies the U.S. with about 85% of its supply of the fertilizer ingredient potash, according to the Farm Bureau.\n\n\u201cFarmers support the goals of ensuring security and fair trade with other nations, but additional tariffs, along with expected retaliatory tariffs, will take a toll on rural America,\u201d Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall said in a statement.\n\nTariffs will have serious consequences for American agriculture, National Farmers Union President Rob Larew said.\n\n\u201cWe are already facing significant economic uncertainty, and these actions only add to the strain,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nCanada immediately imposed 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. imports. The tariff will apply to farm equipment and farm goods such as poultry, eggs, meat, wheat, cherries, barley and dairy products.\n\nIf the U.S. doesn\u2019t lift tariffs, Canada plans a second wave of 25% tariffs in 21 days on goods worth $125 billion. The second list includes apples, pears, potatoes, onions and potash.\n\nChina Daily, owned by the Chinese government, reported China will impose 15% tariffs on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton, and 10% tariffs on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The tariffs will take effect March 10.\n\nTrump imposed tariffs after a 30-day pause expired. The Trump administration said the three countries had failed to do enough to stop the cross-border trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nTrump invoked the International Emergency Powers Act as the legal basis for imposing tariffs. A spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry said it was a \u201cflimsy excuse.\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was \u201cbogus.\u201d\n\nTrudeau speculated Trump was trying to weaken the Canadian economy to make it easier to annex Canada as the 51st state.\n\nAddressing himself at a press conference to \u201cDonald,\u201d Trudeau said, \u201dThis is a very dumb thing to do.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters the day before the tariffs went into effect, Trump didn\u2019t mention fentanyl. Tariffs will create U.S. jobs, he said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished, and they\u2019re being punished by tariffs,\u201d Trump said.",

Get all the details with the FloWrestling Watch Guide.\n\nHere are 10 must-watch first-round matches beginning at 10 a.m. CT.\n\n103: Juliana Alejandro (Tiffin) vs #12 Mia Zuniga (King)\n\nKing doesn\u2019t have its best post-season lineup due to injury and redshirts. Still, the Tornado has powerful individuals that can rip through the field. Zuniga has a tough opening match against Juliana Alejandro, whom she defeated 7-4 on Dec. 6, 2024. This could be competitive, and a win for King is important for the team race.\n\n103: Olivia Klein (East Stroudsburg) vs Madison Heinzer (Colorado Mesa)\n\nKlein has one loss at 103 this season and didn\u2019t get seeded. She has a tough test against Heinzer.\n\n110: #3 Samara Chavez (King) vs Kat Pendergrass (Gannon)\n\nChavez has the tools to reach the finals after finishing 3-2-3 at the past three national championships. She\u2019ll have to get by Pendergrass, a two-time All-American, in the first round to win her first title.\n\n110: Samantha Miller (McKendree) vs #4 Kendra Ryan (North Central)\n\nMiller and Ryan met twice at the 2024 National Collegiate Women\u2019s Wrestling Championships. Ryan, a three-time All-American (6-5-4), won by 10-0 tech in the quarters, and Miller (6-5-5-3), a four-time All-American, won by fall for third. Ryan pinned Miller on Nov. 9, 2024, to start the season.\n\n117: Nohea Moniz (Sacred Heart) vs #2 Yu Sakamoto (Northern Michigan)\n\nMoniz pinned Sakamoto on Nov. 9 during a dual, handing her the only loss this season. Sakamoto, a 2024 U23 World champion for Japan, faces Moniz in the first round.\n\n131: #4 Jaclyn Dehney (New England) vs Lily Sherer (Lock Haven)\n\nDehney is 28-0 with two forfeits and 26 pins (25 in the first period). She faces Sherer, a 2023 All-American.\n\n131: Hannah Palise (Grand Valley State) vs #8 Anna Dicugno (King)\n\nGrand Valley State and King are battling for a trophy, so this match has implications for both teams.\n\n131: Zoe Gress (East Stroudsburg) vs #6 Emmily Patneaud (Iowa)\n\nPatneaud faces Gress, a two-time All-American, in her opening match.\n\n145: #9 Erica Schroeder (Colorado Mesa) vs Skylar Little Soldier (Grand Valley State)\n\nSchroeder takes on Little Soldier of upstart Grand Valley State. Little Soldier was up 8-0 and pinned Schroeder at the Missouri Valley Open. This is a big opening match for both teams.\n\n180: #5 Brittyn Corbishley (North Central) vs Jacklyn Smith (Sacred Heart)\n\nCorbishley has a tall task against Smith, a two-time All-American. North Central is in the trophy hunt; this is important for both teams.\n\nSeeds for the 2025 National Collegiate Women's Wrestling Championships.\n\n103 Pounds\n\n1. Rianne Murphy (Iowa)\n\n2.

            "content": "The blue chip shipping courier could be turning a corner.\n\nUPS (UPS 1.33%) was once considered a stable blue chip stock for income investors. It's one of the world's largest shipping couriers, it's been a member of the S&P 500 for 23 years, and it's raised its dividend annually for 16 consecutive years.\n\nBut over the past 12 months, UPS' stock dropped more than 20% as the S&P 500 rose nearly 20%. Let's see why it underperformed the market, and if it's still worth buying today.\n\nWhy did UPS underperform the market?\n\nUPS' average daily package volume and average revenue per piece grew in tandem in 2020 and 2021 as the pandemic drove people to buy more products online. Its profits also surged as its higher fees offset its rising operating expenses.\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Average daily package volume 21.9 million 24.7 million 25.3 million 24.3 million 22.3 million 22.4 million Average revenue per piece $10.87 $10.94 $12.32 $13.38 $13.62 $13.60 Total revenue $74.1 billion $84.6 billion $97.3 billion $100.3 billion $91 billion $91.1 billion Adjusted operating margin 11% 10.3% 13.5% 13.8% 10.9% 9.8% Diluted EPS $7.53 $8.23 $14.68 $13.20 $7.80 $6.75\n\nBut in 2022 and 2023, UPS' package volumes dropped as the pandemic-driven tailwinds dissipated, inflation throttled consumer spending, and the threat of a potential strike from the Teamsters Union -- which represents roughly 333,000 UPS workers -- drove some of its customers to shift their deliveries to FedEx and other courier services. UPS tried to offset those slower shipments with price hikes, but its operating margins were still squeezed by higher labor and fuel costs.\n\nIn 2024, UPS' package volumes and total revenue rose again. That recovery was driven by the stabilizing macro environment and a new contract with the Teamsters Union to avert a strike. However, those higher labor and pension costs -- along with its divestment of Coyote Logistics, regulatory fines in the U.S. and Italy, impairment charges, and investments in its digital upgrades -- still reduced its earnings per share (EPS) by 13% on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis.\n\nWhat's next for UPS?\n\nUPS plans to automate more of its services, invest in new logistics technologies, reduce its mix of lower-margin customers, increase its mix of higher-margin enterprise customers and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and further prune its workforce. It already laid off about 12,000 employees after it secured its new Teamsters contract last year, and it aims to save $1 billion in 2025 through its new \"Efficiency Reimagined\" plan to further cut costs and streamline its business.\n\nFor 2025, it expects its revenue to dip 2% to $89 billion, with an 8.5% decline in its average daily package volume offsetting a 6% increase in its average revenue per piece. However, $1.5 billion of that revenue decline can be attributed to its divestment of Coyote. Excluding Coyote, it expects a milder decline of about 0.6%.\n\nThat mixed outlook indicates that UPS hasn't quite reached its cyclical trough yet, and it expects that slowdown to continue as it intentionally reduces its orders from its largest customer -- Amazon -- by more than 50% through 2026. That reduction will throttle UPS' near-term revenue growth, but it should boost its long-term profits, since Amazon's orders generate lower-margin revenue than its smaller customers.\n\nHowever, UPS expects its adjusted operating margin to expand to 10.8% in 2025 as its cost-cutting measures kick in. It also plans to buy back $1 billion in shares, and analysts expect its GAAP EPS to grow 16% for the full year.\n\nAt $117, UPS' stock looks cheap at 15 times that estimate. It also pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 5.6% -- which is significantly higher than the 10-year Treasury's 4.3% yield.\n\nIs it the right time to buy UPS?\n\nUPS is overcoming many of its previous challenges, and its top-line growth should stabilize once it fully laps its sale of Coyote and its reduction of Amazon's orders. Until that happens, it should keep focusing on stabilizing its operating margins, growing its earnings, and plowing its free cash flow into its ongoing dividends and buybacks. Its low valuation and high dividend yield should also limit its downside potential and make it an attractive investment in this frothy market.\n\nUPS' stock won't blast off anytime soon, but it looks like a safe place to park your cash and earn some extra income. So for now, I think it's a worthy buy for value-oriented income investors.",

            "content": "Smith: A warm, sunny day of chasing flags can make ice anglers of any age feel like kids An ice fishing outing with tip-ups yields good catches of largemouth bass and northern pike and provides plenty of fun for anglers in northwestern Wisconsin.\n\nSPOONER - The sun has at least two lives in winter.\n\nIts power was on full display on a recent clear morning in eastern Burnett County.\n\nFirst it slanted down to the snow-covered surface of Lipsett Lake, revealing a brilliant, white plain.\n\nThen it reflected up, glistening like diamonds off airborne snow crystals.\n\nThat's just the physical.\n\nI'd argue it has mood effects, too.\n\nLike how sunshine can make a late winter day feel so much more comfortable than one with thick overcast.\n\n\"No jacket required,\" said Bill Smith of Shell Lake as we set out at 8:30 a.m. on Lipsett Lake for a day of ice fishing.\n\nSmith drilled holes with an electric auger, I cleaned out the slush and set a couple tip-ups.\n\nOver the coming hour, the rest of our group \u2013 Larry Damman of Shell Lake, Bruce Moss of Spooner and Dave Zeug of Shell Lake \u2013 filtered in to our temporary village on the ice. Damman and Moss also brought their dogs for some sun and exercise.\n\nThe five of us have known each other for at least a decade, but some of the relationships go back 40 years. Damman, Moss, Smith and Zeug are all retired from various careers at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, including fields from fisheries to wildlife to law enforcement to engineering and administration.\n\nI didn't know what was taking place at DNR offices in Madison or other parts, but it was very possible for at least a few hours this day this small, frozen section of Lipsett harbored more Wisconsin natural resources experience and knowledge than any other gathering in the state.\n\nThough their full-time work is in the rear-view mirror several have part-time jobs or volunteer roles that take up dozens of hours a week. Their commitment to serving the public and the state's resources still runs strong.\n\nSo it was a treat to find a time in everyone's schedules when we could gather for some ice fishing, camaraderie and hopefully procure some fresh fish for dinners.\n\nZeug gets credit for picking the day. He looked at the forecast and had us mark our calendars on the back side of a weather system that brought extremely high winds.\n\nWhen we rolled out on Lipsett the west wind was hardly perceptible at 4 miles per hour. The mercury was 29 degrees Fahrenheit. The ice was solid and 14 inches thick.\n\nAnd with a bright sun overhead, for this crew of winter-hardened Wisconsinites the day had a lightness that felt more like spring, like t-shirt and shorts weather.\n\nLipsett Lake covers 393 acres and has a maximum depth of 24 feet. It has a fairly standard northern Wisconsin fish community including largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch, walleye and muskellunge. The lake's water clarity is low, according to the DNR.\n\nAnd similar to many other lakes in northwestern Wisconsin, in recent decades Lipsett's largemouth bass population has increased in abundance.\n\nIn recognition of this fact the DNR and local anglers worked to enact regulations on Lipsett and certain nearby waters that encourage harvest of largemouth bass.\n\nIn 2012, for example, the minimum size limit was removed for bass on most lakes in Burnett and Washburn counties. In most of the state a bass must be 14 inches to keep.\n\nThe daily bag limit on Lipsett is five bass, the same as the state norm.\n\nLipsett also has a lot of northern pike but of relatively small size. So the lake's regulations also encourage harvest of pike \u2013 there is no minimum size limit and the daily bag limit is five.\n\nIn recent years I've made at least one trip a year to northwestern Wisconsin with the intent on keeping some largemouth. I've learned that the fish, when handled properly, are excellent table fare.\n\nSo on this trip I was hoping to catch and keep some bass as well as some pike.\n\nThe fishing was simple, time-honored Wisconsin winter tactics. We spread out over an area with weed beds in water that ranged from about 8 to 16 feet deep and set-tip ups baited with large minnows. Smith and I started out by setting the minnows about 6 feet below the surface.\n\nOur strategy was to start at that depth and modify as necessary based on results.\n\nThe outing was also conducted without any forward-facing sonar or underwater cameras.\n\nTip-ups are one of the most fun and social ways to fish on the ice. There's instant excitement when a flag flies, hopefully signaling a hit.\n\nAnd there's the exercise component of running or shuffling to the rig to see if a fish is on the other end of the line.\n\nIt's a great activity for kids. But also for youthful spirits of all ages.\n\nOur \"old school\" gear and tactics was typified by Moss, one of the thriftiest people I know. His tip-up assortment includes a couple Ice Fisherman models made in 1974 in Cumberland. They are worn but still work fine.\n\nHe's used them so much we had to replace the flag material on one. So what did he chose? Recycled plastic from an old Wisconsin deer hunting backtag.\n\nDamman brought a Beaver Dam tip-up he uses as a coach for the Shell Lake High School ice fishing team. It had a shiny, painted surface featuring the image of a northern pike. It worked, too.\n\nOne of Smith's Beaver Dam tip-ups was a 50th anniversary Arctic Fisherman model. The brand originated in 1962.\n\nSmith and I had just got two tip-ups set for each of us when one of the flags went up.\n\nI skidded 40 yards over the snow and ice and saw the spool still turning. I gently lifted the tip-up from the hole and peeled off a foot of the heavy main line. As the fish took out the slack, I grabbed the line and set the hook.\n\nAfter a minute of to-and-fro I lifted a 25-inch northern onto the ice.\n\nI decided it was an eater.\n\nBecause a pair of bald eagles regularly work the lake, Smith told me to put the fish under the tailgate of his truck.\n\nSure enough, a few minutes later a mature eagle swooped low in our area as I reset the tip-up. It was apparently looking for a fish treat.\n\nBut the \"eagle guard\" worked like a charm.\n\nOver the next four hours our group had at least one flag every 15 minutes. The fish were a mix of largemouth and northerns.\n\nIt seemed like the warming temperatures and sun had stimulated the food web under the ice. The tip-up action was so fast that I never set up a jig pole I brought along.\n\nAnd we never experimented with our depth setting. Six feet under the ice worked just fine.\n\nSmith did do some hole hopping with a small jig and wax worm and caught a bunch of bluegills. He let most go but kept a plump 8-incher.\n\nAbout 11 a.m. I followed Zeug as he shuffled to one of his tip-ups. He set the hook and had a tussle with a 28-inch northern, likely the biggest of the day.\n\n\"This never gets old,\" he said.\n\nA few minutes later as Zeug unhooked and released a smaller northern, it spit out a slender, 1.5-inch-long minnow. Neither of us knew what it was. But we had just the person in our group to ask \u2013 Damman worked as a fisheries biologist for the DNR.\n\nI carried it over and asked him to identify it.\n\n\"Brook silverside,\" Damman said. \"Most fish that eat them also look just like that, skinny.\"\n\nDamman said the shiny minnows are often visible on summer evenings near the surface of Wisconsin lakes as they gather in schools.\n\nWhen it comes to fishing tip-ups, we all preferred larger minnows, even small suckers. Our largest minnow of the day, about a 7-inch-long sucker, got taken by a 15-inch northern.\n\nMoss, who spent his career in wildlife, dispensed a pearl of wisdom that applies to all wild things.\n\n\"Fish don't have mirrors,\" Moss said. \"That northern doesn't know how big it is. It just knows it's hungry.\"\n\nBy noon the mercury had risen to 35 and the wind was still light. We deployed a couple folding chairs and enjoyed a lunch of sandwiches and jerky.\n\nThe dogs cavorted in the snow and we told stories, often interrupted by a flag.\n\nAt 1 p.m. Damman caught the biggest bass of the day, a 20-incher which he released.\n\nI ended up keeping three largemouth and three pike for future dinners.\n\nAlthough some types of fishing involve more sitting than moving, ice fishing with tip-ups could be part of an exercise program. Over about five hours of fishing, a device told me I had put in 7,343 steps or about 3.5 miles.\n\nThe sun was still shining brightly when I got off the ice about 2 p.m. and it was warmer yet, 43 degrees.\n\nWe used simple techniques, but set against the backdrop of an increasingly chaotic world, the outing provided multiple, out-sized benefits.\n\nNot only did the sun provide us with light and energy, but procuring fresh, wild protein and sharing the ice with friends in a time-honored activity highlighted some of the good things that haven't changed.\n\nThe day helped inject some optimism for the future.\n\nAnd for winter fun in Wisconsin, it reminded us there's nothing better than chasing flags.",

Cena, Rock, and rapper Travis Scott proceeded to obliterate Rhodes as the PLE closed out, leaving the Undisputed WWE Champion in a bloody heap and dramatically altering the landscape of the company.\n\nElimination Chamber itself as an event was a four-match show that unquestionably delivered with both of its signature matches and somewhat fumbled the two others. However, nothing on this show was actively bad \u2013 save for one announcer. Some of the negatives noted below are more of a feeling or personal view than something that will be universally panned. Your mileage might vary.\n\nSaturday\u2019s show also featured a huge return to kick off the women\u2019s chamber match, with Jade Cargill showing up to get revenge on her attacker. And despite not emerging victorious, Liv Morgan had another really solid night in the ring, continuing her run of impressive performances.\n\nBut really, Elimination Chamber will forever be remembered for the final half-hour, and that moment will carry this show to the highest levels as time wears on.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it\u2026",

            "content": "WWE.com\n\nWell, at least WWE didn't take a century to get to the point between The Rock and Cody Rhodes this week. The same couldn't be said for last week's rambling promo between both men. Now for the bad news: It's still unclear whether or not this story is going to satisfy fans heading into WrestleMania 41, or if it'll even have an impact on the main event across either night in Las Vegas.\n\nTime is rapidly running out on that front, but creative will want to put Elimination Chamber in the rearview mirror before painting some of the bigger storytelling strokes on the 'Mania canvas. Friday's episode of SmackDown was all about delivering three things. One, more mental mulling over Rocky's offer from Cody. Two, establishing an official challenger for Shinsuke Nakamura's United States Title. Three, getting you real excited about both Chamber bouts in Toronto.\n\nSuccess varied there, and WWE even exposed the truth about John Cena's retirement run. He's as part time as part time gets. This was probably always going to happen, but the loudest words should go unsaid unless it's someone like Logan Paul needling 'Super Cena' just because he can.\n\nOne glance at the 'Ups' and 'Downs' counts shows that there's still a lot to like about SmackDown despite the pesky third hour that's been added in 2025 and is all over the WWE news. Hopefully, they can do away with that soon and go back to the zippier two hour format. That worked for Fridays better than becoming Raw-lite ever will.\n\nHere's all the good and bad on the final stop before everyone gets locked in those Chamber pods.",

The Eagles smacked up the Chiefs in the Super Bowl 40-22, and Hailee Steinfeld\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is your league MVP.\n\nThe end of an NFL season is sad for us NFL fans. No more lazy Sundays filled with ten hours of football. No more night games after class. No more supporting our favorite teams.\n\nBut it\u2019s a great time to be an NFL Draft fan. Right around this time, the big draft experts drop their first few mock drafts, and the Combine is asleep or two away.\n\nIn 3.0, we know our full draft order, and we finally get our first trade. Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n(This mock was written before the NFL Combine, so combine performances are not considered.)\n\n1. Tennessee Titans: Abdul Carter, Penn State, ED, Junior\n\nUnlike in previous years, this number one pick is up in the air. In my eyes, the Titans can go down three separate avenues: Carter, Travis Hunter, or a quarterback. In 3.0, they add to their pass rush by selecting the Penn State product. If everything comes together for Carter, he could legitimately become the best edge in the entire league.\n\n2. TRADE | Las Vegas Raiders: Cam Ward, Miami (FL), QB, Senior\n\nWith new head coach, Pete Carroll, and limited owner Tom Brady in town, Vegas rolls the dice and moves up four spots to grab Ward from Miami. I mean no disrespect, but neither Aidan O\u2019Connell nor Gardner Minshew is going to do the job. In a stacked AFC West with QBs like Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, and now Bo Nix, you need a stellar QB to keep up. Ward has all the tools to be just that.\n\n3. New York Giants: Sheduer Sanders, Colorado, QB, Senior\n\nWith Ward off the board, the Giants fill their dire need for a QB with the selection of Sanders. It\u2019s no surprise for me to say that after Ward and Sanders, there\u2019s quite a bit of a drop-off from those two to the next QB in this class. The Giants need a QB, and they get one.\n\n4. New England Patriots: Travis Hunter, Colorado, WR/CB, Junior\n\nNo one is happier than the Patriots when the 2024 Heisman winner falls into their lap at number four. New England needs help at both CB and WR, and Hunter can help out at both positions. If Hunter can become a lockdown corner and comes in as a WR3 in certain offensive packages, he\u2019ll become the Shohei Ohtani of the NFL and one of the most unique players in NFL history.\n\n5. Jacksonville Jaguars: Mason Graham, Michigan, DI, Junior\n\nYou\u2019re going to see this pairing a lot in the pre-draft process. It makes all the sense in the world for the Jags. They need interior defensive line help, and Graham would fit right in schematically. After Carter, Graham is the best pure defensive player in the draft, so Jacksonville got themselves a good one.\n\n6. TRADE | Cleveland Browns: Ashton Jeanty, Boise State, RB, Junior\n\nParagraph incoming. Why would the Browns trade back? This question could be floating around your mind right now as you read this. With Carter off the board at number one and the prospect of Myles Garrett being traded, the Browns move back a few spots and accumulate draft capital. For the selection, they picked the 2024 Heisman runner-up, Jeanty. There\u2019s not much going right for the Browns\u2019 offense right now, and that starts with their QB room. Yes, they could\u2019ve selected one with their original pick, but with the combination of this being a relatively weak QB class, a haul of picks, and a sure-fire home-run threat and pick, it\u2019s hard not to like this for Cleveland.\n\n7. New York Jets: Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona, WR, Junior\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say what the Jets could do with this pick. With QB Aaron Rodgers soon to be out the door and the arrival of HC Aaron Glenn, the Jets look to upgrade their WR room with the selection of McMillan. If Rodgers is gone, it\u2019s not crazy to say that WR Davante Adams could be gone as well. If true, New York will need a big-body threat to pair with fellow WR Garrett Wilson. McMillan would be just that.\n\n8. Carolina Panthers: James Pearce Jr., Tennessee, ED, Junior\n\nPearce Jr. is right up there with Carter when it comes to the potential at the edge position. If the pieces fall into their correct places for Pearch Jr., he\u2019ll be a premier pass-rusher in the NFL. The Panthers love the sound of that, so they use their first pick of him.\n\n9. New Orleans Saints: Luther Burden III, Missouri, WR, Junior\n\nWith new HC Kellen Moore, the Saints go offense with his first pick. It\u2019s uncertain who their future QB is going to be in New Orleans, but they\u2019re going to love having Burden and WR Chris Olave to throw to.\n\n10. Chicago Bears: Will Campbell, LSU, T, Junior\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious need for the Bears, and it\u2019s to upgrade their offensive line. Seeing how the board fell, no one is happier than QB Caleb Williams and Chicago when they\u2019re able to select Campbell from LSU. On day one, Campbell may just already be the best offensive lineman on the team.\n\n11. San Francisco 49ers: Will Johnson, Michigan, CB, Junior\n\nBack-to-back value picks come off the board when the Niners pick Johnson from Michigan. Before this past season, it wasn\u2019t a far cry to say that Johnson could have been the number one pick. After a relatively underwhelming season and an injury, Johnson falls to 11 in 3.0.\n\n12. Dallas Cowboys: Walter Nolen, Ole Miss, DI, Junior\n\nThe weakest spot on this Cowboys team is their interior offensive line. Mazi Smith is in bust territory, and Osa Odigizawa could be on his way out the door, so grabbing help interior help would be best. Nolen is a former five-star coming out of high school and has all the tools to be an absolute force on Dallas\u2019 defensive line.\n\n13. Miami Dolphins: Kelvin Banks Jr., Texas, T, Junior\n\nAnother team that desperately needs help along their offensive line is Miami. After Campbell, Banks Jr. would be the best option. I foresee the Phins moving him inside to guard.\n\n14. Indianapolis Colts: Tyler Warren, Penn State, TE, Senior\n\nAnother connection you\u2019re going to see many times in this draft process is Warren to Indianapolis. The Colts need another pass-catching threat for their offense, and Warren gives them that threat, along with inside-outside versatility and the ability to block.\n\n15. Atlanta Falcons: Mykel Williams, Georgia, ED, Junior\n\nWilliams stays in the state when the Falcons take him at pick 15. The ATL desperately needs edge help, and they have their pick of the litter at this pick. I like Williams, as he fits the most on the Falcons and could be their number one pass-rushing option for years to come.\n\n16. Arizona Cardinals: Kenneth Grant, Michigan, DI, Junior\n\nI don\u2019t say this lightly; Grant has one of the highest ceilings in this draft class. Higher than his teammate Graham and just as high as Carter and even Hunter. The downside is that he doesn\u2019t have the same floor as those three. The Cardinals grab him with their pick to try to develop him to that elite ceiling.\n\n17. Cincinnati Bengals: Shemar Stewart, Texas A&M, ED, Junior\n\nMore pass-rushers! This time, the Bengals select Stewart from A&M to add more firepower to their d-line. Considering how amazing their offense is, it\u2019s a testimony to how far away their defense is because of how they missed the playoffs. If they can improve their pass rush, their defense could be much improved in 2025-26.\n\n18. Seattle Seahawks: Mike Green, Marshall, ED, Junior (RS)\n\nGreen is the fourth straight pass rusher to come off the board, and how has he flown up the boards? He\u2019s been one of the biggest risers so far in this draft process. He\u2019s a fantastic athlete with a quick twitch first step and an impressive motor. Seattle will love him.\n\n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Jahdae Barron, Texas, CB, Senior\n\nBarron is another player who has done a lot for his draft stock in a small amount of time. A month or two ago, the Texas product was a fringe first-round talent. Now, Barron will go closer to the top ten. Even at pick 19, where the Bucs select him, he is great value.\n\n20. Denver Broncos: Colston Loveland, Michigan, TE, Junior\n\nThis just makes a ton of sense for both parties involved. Coming off an expectation-shattering season with then-rookie QB Bo Nix, it would be smart to give him more weapons. The Broncos don\u2019t have a legitimate TE threat on their team, which would allow Loveland to come in and immediately produce a big slot.\n\n21. Pittsburgh Steelers: Matthew Golden, Texas, WR, Junior\n\nWhile I\u2019m not as convinced the Steelers are going to take a WR as once was a month and a half ago, I still have them taking Golden in 3.0. The Texas receiver has great speed on the outside and control of said speed. He can speed up to full speed quickly and be able to modulate that speed to create separation. He will pair well with WR George Pickens in Pittsburgh.\n\n22. Los Angeles Chargers: Omarion Hampton, North Carolina, RB, Junior\n\nHello Hamption into the first round. While Jeanty has rightfully garnered tons of praise, don\u2019t sleep on the other RB in this draft class. Hampton is one of those players. Built like an NFL back, Hampton has great speed, burst, and vision for the position.\n\n23. Green Bay Packers: Derrick Harmon, Miami (FL), DI, Junior\n\nIf you follow MSU football closely enough, you might recognize this name. Harmon transferred from East Lansing to Coral Gables after the 2023-24 season, and the following year was a big one for him. He showed him consistent pass-rush movement and a strong upper body. Green Bay, needing interior defensive line help, picked him up with the 23rd selection.\n\n24. Minnesota Vikings: Tyler Booker, Alabama, G, Junior\n\nJust like their NFC North counterpart in Illinois, the Vikings need guard help. The best guard still on the board would be Booker from Alabama, so the pick is easy for Minnesota. I initially hesitated on Booker as a first-round pick, but you can\u2019t deny his floor. While maybe not the flashiest of prospects, Booker will do the job.\n\n25. Houston Texans: Emeka Egbuka, Ohio State, WR, Senior\n\nOne year ago, the Texans\u2019 WR room looked great. Nico Collins, Tank Dell, and Stefon Diggs, who could ask for more? With the injuries of both Dell and Diggs, their WR room is now marred with question marks. Grabbing Egbuka from OSU reunites him and Stroud in Houston and brings a complementary receiving threat to Collins.\n\n26. Los Angeles Rams: Armand Membou, Missouri, T, Junior\n\nMembou is another one of these prospects that\u2019s had a great last month and a half. You used to never see him in draft talks, now you can\u2019t read a first-round mock without seeing him. The Rams have some aging tackles on their roster, so Membou brings some much-needed youth to LA.\n\n27. Baltimore Ravens: Josh Simmons, Ohio State, T, Junior (RS)\n\nAnother tackle comes off the board when the Ravens snag Simmons from OSU. Before his injury in the midseason matchup against Oregon, Simmons was tracking to be one of the first, maybe even the first, tackle off the board. Despite the injury, Simmons holds first-round talent and goes at pick 27.\n\n28. Detroit Lions: Nic Scourton, Texas A&M, ED, Junior\n\nAfter a disappointing end to their 2024-25 season, another pass rusher is at the top of the Lions\u2019 list. Well, if you haven\u2019t noticed, this draft class is filled with first-round-caliber edge players, and Scourton is one of those guys. His size and physicality while pairing well with fellow pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson in Detroit.\n\n29. Washington Commanders: Josh Conerly Jr., Oregon, T, Junior\n\nThe team that knocked off the Lions in the divisional round picks next in the Commanders. What a year it was for Washington. A conference championship round appearance and, even more importantly, they found their franchise. The smart thing would be to build around that newfound franchise and give him some protection, that protection being Conerly Jr. from Oregon.\n\n30. Buffalo Bills: Malaki Starks, Georgia, S, Junior\n\nIn what may be the best value pick in the entire draft, the Bills have Starks from Georgia fall right into their laps at pick 30. If Starks wasn\u2019t a safety and played a position with more value, he might be a top-ten pick. He has incredible instincts, which is maybe the most important asset when playing the safety position.\n\n31. Kansas City Chiefs: Grey Zabel, North Dakota State, T, Senior\n\nIf you watched that Super Bowl, it\u2019s hard to conclude that this first pick for the Chiefs shouldn\u2019t be used on an offensive lineman. That o-line was demolished and was maybe one of the biggest reasons why the Eagles rolled KC. With their first pick, they grab Zabel out of the Dakotas. Along with a few other players in this first round, Zabel has rocketed up the boards.\n\n32. Philadelphia Eagles: Jalon Walker, Georgia, LB, Junior\n\nThe champs end night one by picking up Walker. When evaluating a roster like Philly\u2019s, it\u2019s hard to find a weakness. There might not be a single weakness on this team!? Which is crazy to say. With this pick, they go back to the SEC well and grab the explosive Georgia product.",

The massive Marvel movie marks the arrival of a Tony Stark that friends of the late, great Iron Man will be shocked to see. It won't be the only odd reunion in the massive superhero spectacle, though. Other characters, new and old, could cross paths, and fans are itching to see what comes when they do.\n\nMCU lovers took to Reddit to posit the interactions that would have them going wild in the aisles to see, and one stood out more than most simply because of the history associated with it. An obvious one would be Doctor Doom/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meeting his variant's web-slinging protege, Peter Parker (Tom Holland), who was wracked with grief following Iron Man's death at the end of Avengers: Endgame. Bittersweet doesn't even cut it, considering that Stark was the closest thing to a father figure that Peter had following the death of his Uncle Ben. Unfortunately, chances are that the leader of Latveria will have no time for the wall-crawling menace, which could spell for an emotional conflict. One fan wrote, \"If they do decide to have RDJ's appearance be relevant to the movie, it would also be really interesting to see Peters reaction.\"\n\nOther potential meet-ups that may or may not be heated included Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), as well as Doom meeting Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) given how much time the Guardian of the Galaxy member spent with Stark building the replacement Infinity Gauntlet. Perhaps one of the most heart-wrenching options, however, would be the savior of The Sacred Timeline and the God of Thunder. Since Avengers: Infinity War, Thor has believed his brother permanently dead, only for the former God of Mischief to break free and walk a path of redemption that saw him save time itself. Getting them together wouldn't just be great, it'd be an onion-cutting extravaganza. As one fan pointed out, \"Loki and Thor would have the biggest payoff since it's been a relationship we've seen develop since Thor 1.\"\n\nWhether we'll actually see that, however, has yet to be confirmed. Currently, the only cast member who is officially on board the project is Robert Downey Jr., with other cast members either rumored or, in the case of Benedict Cumberbatch, backtracking on whether he is or isn't in the film . Either way, there are going to be some monumental meetings that we can't wait to see. For now, though, check out every Marvel TV show and movie on the way here to help you prepare for Doom.",

            "content": "Viewing insider transactions for Embecta Corp.'s (NASDAQ:EMBC ) over the last year, we see that insiders were net buyers. This means that a larger number of shares were purchased by insiders in relation to shares sold.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Embecta\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Embecta\n\nIn fact, the recent purchase by David Melcher was the biggest purchase of Embecta shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$13.50. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was David Melcher.\n\nYou can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNasdaqGS:EMBC Insider Trading Volume March 1st 2025\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nEmbecta Insiders Bought Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significantly more insider buying, than insider selling, at Embecta. Independent Non-Executive Chairman David Melcher spent US$178k on stock. On the other hand, Independent Director Milton Morris netted US$51k by selling. Insiders have spent more buying shares than they have selling, so on balance we think they are are probably optimistic.\n\nDoes Embecta Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. From looking at our data, insiders own US$4.8m worth of Embecta stock, about 0.6% of the company. We prefer to see high levels of insider ownership.\n\nSo What Do The Embecta Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nIt is good to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. While the overall levels of insider ownership are below what we'd like to see, the history of transactions imply that Embecta insiders are reasonably well aligned, and optimistic for the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Embecta. For example, Embecta has 4 warning signs (and 2 which don't sit too well with us) we think you should know about.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2025). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2413965122\n\nScientists have a new target to prevent cold sores after University of Virginia School of Medicine researchers discovered an unexpected way the herpes virus re-activates in the body. The finding could also have important implications for genital herpes caused by the same virus.\n\nThe discovery from UVA's Anna Cliffe, Ph.D., and colleagues seems to defy common sense. She and her team found that the slumbering herpes virus will make a protein to trigger the body's immune response as part of its escape from dormancy.\n\nYou'd think this would be bad for the virus\u2014that activating the body's antiviral defenses would be like poking a bear. But, instead, it's the opposite: The virus highjacks the antiviral process in infected neurons (nerve cells) to make the type of comeback nobody wants.\n\n\"Our findings identify the first viral protein required for herpes simplex virus to wake up from dormancy, and, surprisingly, this protein does so by triggering responses that should act against the virus,\" said Cliffe of UVA's Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology. \"This is important because it gives us new ways to potentially prevent the virus from waking up and activating immune responses in the nervous system that could have negative consequences in the long term.\"\n\nThe researchers have published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nUnderstanding herpes simplex virus-associated disease\n\nCold sores are caused primarily by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), one of two forms of the herpes virus. HSV-1 is very contagious, and more than 60% of people under 50 have been infected worldwide, the World Health Organization estimates. That's more than 3.8 billion people.\n\nIn addition to causing cold sores, herpes simplex virus 1 can also cause genital herpes, a condition most often associated with HSV-1's cousin, herpes simplex virus 2. Now, however, there are more new cases of genital herpes in the United States caused by HSV-1 than HSV-2. Notably, the UVA researchers found that herpes simplex virus 2 also makes this same protein and may use a similar mechanism to reactivate. So UVA's new discovery may also lead to new treatments for genital herpes.\n\nIn addition to cold sores and genital herpes, HSV-1 can also cause viral encephalitis (brain inflammation) and has been linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nOnce HSV-1 makes its way into our bodies, it stays forever. Our immune systems can send it into hiding, allowing infected people to be symptom-free. But stress, other infections and even sunburns are known to cause it to flare. UVA's new discovery adds another, surprising way it can spring back into action.\n\nThe researchers found that while the virus can make a protein called UL12.5 to reactivate, the protein was not needed in the presence of another infection. The scientists believe this is because the infections trigger certain \"sensing pathways\" that act as the home security system for neurons. Detection of a pathogen alone may be sufficient to trigger the herpes virus to begin replicating, the scientists believe, even in instances of \"abortive infections\"\u2014when the immune system contains the new pathogen before it can replicate.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that HSV-1 doesn't just passively wait for the right conditions to reactivate\u2014it actively senses danger and takes control of the process,\" researcher Patryk Krakowiak said. \"Our findings suggest that the virus may be using immune signals as a way to detect cellular stress\u2014whether from neuron damage, infections or other threats\u2014as a cue to escape its host and find a new one.\"\n\nWith the new understanding of how herpes flares can be triggered, scientists may be able to target the protein to prevent them, the researchers say.\n\n\"We are now following up on this work to investigate how the virus is hijacking this response and testing inhibitors of UL12.5 function,\" Cliffe said. \"Currently, there are no therapies that can prevent the virus from waking up from dormancy, and this stage was thought to only use host proteins. Developing therapies that specifically act on a viral protein is an attractive approach that will likely have fewer side effects than targeting a host protein.\"\n\nThe research team consisted of Krakowiak, Sean R. Cuddy, Matthew E. Flores, Abigail L. Whitford, Sara A. Dochnal, Aleksandra Babnis, Tsuyoshi Miyake, Marco Tigano, Daniel A. Engel and Cliffe. The scientists have no financial interest in the work.\n\nMore information: Patryk A.

In her first year leading a kindergarten class at McDeeds Creek Elementary, Amber planned on becoming a teacher after graduating high school.\n\nFinancial concerns forced her to leave Western Carolina University not long after she first started. It wasn\u2019t until her daughter, Kristine Weary, finished high school that she returned to Western Carolina to realize a dream.\n\n\u201cI had to come back home,\u201d Amber, when reflecting on what caused her early departure, said.\n\nKristine, now a graduate of Western Carolina, also teaches kindergarten at McDeeds Creek.

            "content": "CAMBRIDGE, England\u2014A variety of start-up companies are developing next-generation radar technology for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) applications. According to a recent report by IDTechEx, those firms have raised almost $1 billion in funding over the last 12 years.\n\n\u201cThis influx of capital can be attributed to three key drivers,\u201d says Shihao Fu, technology analyst at IDTechEx. \u201cFirst, the automotive industry's growing demand for safety and robust environmental perception highlights radar's all-weather, high-reliability detection capabilities. Second, the rise of electric vehicles and robotaxis has opened up broader application scenarios for radar.\n\n\u201cFinally, emerging technologies such as 4D imaging radar, high-resolution radar and radar-on-chip [systems] continue to improve sensing accuracy and data fusion, maintaining long-term investor confidence in the radar market,\u201d explains Fu.\n\nDuring this funding wave, companies like Arbe, Mobileye and Uhnder have taken the lead by launching new types of high-performance radar products. These systems have used innovations such as high-resolution sensing and digital beamforming, resulting in improvements in detection accuracy and processing speed. At the same time, advancements in semiconductor manufacturing have decreased production costs, enabling automakers to integrate radar systems into a variety of mass-market vehicles.\n\nFu predicts that radar technology will soon move into a \"practical development\" phase. He claims that industry players must address challenges in three key areas: technology innovation, such as 4D imaging, ultra-wideband and multi-functional integration; cost control to ensure high performance while continuously reducing costs; and commercial adoption\u2014forming close partnerships with Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs to facilitate large-scale deployment.\n\nIn the past, radar's limited vertical resolution often led to misdetections in scenarios like overpasses. \u201cWhen a vehicle is parked under a bridge, conventional 3D radars might merge the overpass structure with the car's roof into a single detection, causing the system to misjudge clearance and overlook collision risks,\u201d explains Fu. \u201cAs the industry shifts toward higher-level autonomy, vehicles must accurately distinguish bridges, other vehicles and pedestrians\u2026and respond safely.\u201d\n\nTo address these challenges, start-ups and Tier One suppliers are expediting the development of 4D imaging radar. Compared to 3D radar, 4D imaging radar offers more granular object data across horizontal, vertical, depth and velocity dimensions. Leveraging multi-antenna arrays and digital beamforming, 4D radars significantly enhance spatial resolution and object classification, reducing false alarms and missed detections in complex traffic conditions.\n\nAs more Level 3 autonomous vehicles enter the market, Fu believes that radars will move beyond driver assistance to serve as a critical layer in environmental perception and advanced decision-making.\n\nFor instance, he says blind-spot detection technology will evolve toward 360-degree monitoring.\n\nThat technology will require multiple short-range radars placed around a vehicle, complemented by forward radar to enable safety features such as pedestrian automatic emergency braking (PAEB) in more complex scenarios. PAEB will use radar, cameras and intelligent algorithms to detect crossing pedestrians, bicycles or other obstacles when turning or exiting side roads. It will automatically issue warnings and apply brakes if necessary.",

The project includes installing 400 new lighting assets and nearly 200 surveillance cameras across the campus. It also includes the installation of 42 emergency call stations and security kiosks.\n\n\u201cBy fast-tracking phase two, we are addressing priority areas of campus and reinforcing our commitment to safety and ensuring that our campus community benefits from enhanced security measures as soon as possible,\u201d Raymond Bartlett, the university\u2019s senior vice president for administration and finance, wrote in a statement. \u201cThis project is a significant step in creating a safe environment for all.\u201d\n\nThe first phase of the project, which focused on residential housing and perimeter parking areas, is nearly complete, the university says.\n\nEarlier this month, three people were assaulted on campus in a four-day period, including one student who was sexually assaulted at knife point in a student parking garage. The crimes prompted a campus-wide protest on Feb. 12.\n\nIn addition to security enhancements, protesters demanded that the school establish a sexual health task force to address issues related to sexual violence and prevention, and restore free self-defense classes previously offered by the school, Houston Public Media reports.\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE 2/11/25:\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 The University of Houston (UH) announced it will increase security measures following three violent incidents in a four-day period.\n\nAround 6 p.m. Friday, a student was sexually assaulted on the second floor of the Welcome Center student parking garage, Houston Public Media reports. A man forced the victim into her vehicle and threatened her with a knife, according to a university security alert issued just over an hour after the incident. On Saturday, UH Police announced the suspect was arrested Friday night near the scene.\n\nOn Feb. 5, a student who was waiting for an elevator inside the same parking garage was assaulted and robbed of their scooter. The day prior, another student was attacked and robbed at the UH South-University Oaks Metro Rail platform.\n\nSenior Asaunte Powell told KHOU that the Welcome Center parking garage has been targeted in the past.\n\n\u201cLast year, someone broke into my car, shattered my window, didn\u2019t take anything because I didn\u2019t have anything to steal,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014Article Continues Below\u2014\u2014\n\nUniversity of Houston Students Demand More Security\n\nAn online petition that has garnered nearly 8,000 signatures is calling for added security, including increased security personnel, increase surveillance systems, increased lighting, working emergency stations, and transparent communication regarding safety and security incidents.\n\nEffective Feb. 10, the university police department increased security presence across campus parking structures and assigned four officers to patrol the Welcome Center garage 24/7, citing its proximity to the Metro Light Rail Line. Campus officials said the University of Houston Executive Steering Committee on Safety and Security will also develop a comprehensive plan \u201cwith both immediate and long-term strategies to address safety concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worry about my safety all the time, literally have pepper spray. Didn\u2019t really feel the need to use it, but you never know now and that\u2019s not okay,\u201d said student Aisha Freeman. \u201cI\u2019m glad that they have more security, but I wish that it steps were taken prior to Friday.\u201d\n\nUH Police said they are actively investigating the attacks in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies and are urging students, faculty, and visitors to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity by calling them or 911.\n\n\u201cCampus safety is not just a priority\u2014 it is a responsibility we take seriously,\u201d University of Houston President Renu Khator wrote in an email Saturday. \u201cWe are listening. We are acting. Our campus must remain a safe learning and working environment, and we will not tolerate criminal activity on our campus.\u201d",

For an immigrant illegally in Florida, that same crime now carries a felony punishment of up to five years behind bars and a $5,000 fine.\n\nThe new laws in Florida come as President Donald Trump cracks down on illegal immigration. They impose harsher penalties for offenses committed by people illegally in the U.S. than for everyone else. The consequences are particularly stiff for first-degree murder, which now carries an automatic death sentence for anyone who is in the U.S. illegally.\n\nWhile Florida is more aggressive than most, there are other states considering similar measures to enhance criminal penalties based on immigration status.\n\nA deterrence, but is it constitutional?\n\nRepublican Gov. Ron DeSantis says \u201cFlorida will be safer and securer,\u201d and a model for other states, because of its sweeping immigration laws.\n\nThe stiffer penalties are meant to be a deterrent, Republican state Rep. Lawrence McClure said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t come to the state of Florida illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the premise.\u201d\n\nSome civil rights advocates and legal experts are raising alarm.\n\nThe laws are \u201cleading into a head-on collision with the constitutional guarantee of equal protection to everyone who is in the United States,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, a law professor at Ohio State University who specializes in immigration and criminal law.\n\nAre mandatory death sentences allowed?\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump ordered a renewed emphasis on the death penalty. His executive order highlighted two particular grounds for it: murdering a law enforcement officer or committing any capital offense while in the U.S. illegally. But jurors and federal judges would still decide whether to impose the death sentence.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 ruled North Carolina\u2019s mandatory death sentence for first-degree murder violated the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. States since then have generally used court proceedings in which jurors first decide guilt, then weigh aggravating and mitigating factors when deciding whether defendants should be sentenced to death.\n\n\u201cThere is longstanding precedent making clear that mandatory death penalty laws are unconstitutional,\u201d said Kara Gross, legislative director and senior policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida.\n\nBut Florida\u2019s new laws eliminate judicial discretion in certain cases. They require courts to impose a death sentence on defendants in the U.S. illegally who are found guilty of capital offenses such as first-degree murder or child rape.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Randy Fine acknowledged the legislation he co-sponsored will likely face a legal challenge, but he expects the Supreme Court to overturn its prior ruling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost 50 years later,\u201d Fine said, adding, \u201cThe Supreme Court changes its mind on things.\u201d\n\nMore time for the same crime\n\nLast year, DeSantis signed a law enhancing penalties for people who commit state felonies after being previously deported and convicted of illegal reentry under federal law. The measure increased sentences by one classification, meaning someone convicted of a third-degree felony typically punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine would instead be sentenced for a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\nThe latest Florida laws apply similar sentencing enhancements to anyone in the U.S. illegally, regardless of any convictions for reentering, and apply the enhanced penalties to misdemeanors.\n\nIf the new laws get challenged, Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said, a court would likely look to a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The justices said Texas failed to show a substantial state interest for a law barring state school funding for children not \u201clegally admitted\u201d to the U.S. The high court cited the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment, which says a state shall not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d\n\nTo defend Florida\u2019s law, state attorneys would probably have to answer a similar question: \u201cWhat is your compelling justification for treating individuals who are accused of a crime \u2014 the same crime \u2014 differently based solely on their citizenship status?\u201d Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said.\n\nOther states may follow Florida\u2019s lead\n\nLegislation pending in several states \u2014 including Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Minnesota, South Carolina and Texas \u2014 would allow enhanced penalties for some state crimes committed by immigrants illegally in the U.S., according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.\n\nA bill by Texas state Sen. Pete Flores would raise penalties one notch for most felonies committed by people in the U.S. illegally.\n\nFlores, who is chair of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee and co-founder of the Texas Hispanic Republican Caucus, described the legislation as \u201ca common-sense, tough-on-crime response to enforce the rule of law and better protect Texans.\u201d\n\nLegislation that passed the Utah Senate and is now pending in the House takes a more narrow approach focused on theft and drug dealing. It would impose mandatory jail sentences, without the potential for early release, for repeat offenders who are lawful U.S. residents or for any offenders who were previously deported and then convicted in federal court of illegally reentering the U.S.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Cal Musselman said his legislation targets \u201ca small group of individuals.\u201d Law enforcement officers have told him they see \u201ca clear connection between being deported multiple times, coming in, and committing crimes within the state.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\n___\n\nPayne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Photo by Kaeli Talora/BU Athletics After a Career of Ups and Downs, Callie Shanahan Is Playing the Best Hockey of Her Life Terrier senior goaltender has sights set on playing for the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League\n\nWhen Callie Shanahan was growing up, she had a sign in her room with her life\u2019s goal written on it: First NHL Women\u2019s Player.\n\nSince then, the Boston University women\u2019s ice hockey goaltender has witnessed a whirlwind evolution in women\u2019s hockey and in her own game as she prepares to make the jump to the next level.\n\nThe NHL \u201cis obviously not possible, but now these younger girls can actually have a career in hockey,\u201d Shanahan (CAS\u201925) says. \u201cIt\u2019s been cool for me, seeing that progression growing up and just hoping that I can eventually play pro hockey too.\u201d\n\nBefore that, however, Shanahan will anchor the BU women\u2019s hockey team in the Hockey East tournament, which begins February 26, with the Terriers the No. 2 seed. The team is in the midst of an impressive push back to relevance, earning the most wins in a season since 2019-2020. The tournament concludes March 8.\n\nShanahan has had a BU career marked by \u201clots of ups and downs,\u201d as she puts it\u2014early success, followed by setbacks and injuries. This season, she has been key to the team\u2019s turnaround.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see when you can put a body of work together like that,\u201d says head coach Tara Watchorn (Sargent\u201912). \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that we wouldn\u2019t be having the season we\u2019re having without her. She\u2019s a big part of it, in net and as a leader.\u201d\n\nShanahan\u2019s dreams of professional hockey were born in her hometown of Commerce, a township in the southeast corner of Michigan\u2014roughly 35 miles from Detroit, the self-proclaimed \u201cHockeytown.\u201d She grew up in a setting where ponds and lakes seemingly outnumber residents and ice skates are as common as boots and scarves. Top U.S. goaltender Connor Hellebuyck once called Commerce home.\n\nShe first laced up and hit the ice at age three, guided by her father, Dan Shanahan, who grew up playing hockey and still plays beer league. \u201cHe gets butterflies sometimes before beer league games, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s just so competitive,\u201d Shanahan says. \u201cHe\u2019s such a student of the game and he loves hockey, and I think that\u2019s where I got that love and passion for the game.\u201d\n\nShanahan during a home game against Vermont on January 31, 2025. She and the BU women\u2019s ice hockey team are chasing a Hockey East Championship trophy, beginning Saturday, March 1, in the tournament quarterfinals. Photo by Matt Woolverton/BU Athletics\n\nHis daughter started out as a figure skater, but was \u201cfar from graceful,\u201d she says. She felt much more comfortable after switching to hockey skates at age seven. Playing two years as a skater, Shanahan decided to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps and become a goaltender.\n\nHe knew what it entailed\u2014his response: \u201cOh, jeez.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething pulled me towards being a goalie,\u201d his daughter says. \u201cI was like, it can\u2019t be that hard. It\u2019s a small puck, but the net\u2019s not that big. It can\u2019t be that hard. Little did I know\u2014it\u2019s really hard.\u201d\n\nDespite her passion for ice hockey, Shanahan didn\u2019t want to concentrate on one sport and get burnt out. Throughout high school, she ran cross country and track and played soccer in addition to hockey.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t planned to play hockey at the collegiate level. A tough year of hockey nearly convinced her to pursue collegiate soccer\u2014but then she was named to Team USA for the IIHF Women\u2019s World Under-18 Championship.\n\nPlaying amongst her most talented contemporaries was surreal, she says, but it also \u201clit a fire\u201d under the then-17-year-old netminder. When she returned home from the championship in Slovakia, it was with a gold medal and a new attitude towards hockey.\n\n\u201cIt totally opened my eyes to how talented the girls around me were at that age,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gave me motivation to train even harder and work harder, so it was a very humbling experience for sure, but it was an honor and a privilege.\u201d\n\nWith the decision to play collegiate hockey made, Shanahan looked out of state, since Michigan has no Division 1 women\u2019s hockey programs. She had been to Boston for tournaments in the past, and BU was everything she was looking for. When the Terriers began to recruit her, she says, \u201cit was a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for her to make an impact at BU. By October of freshman year, the netminder had earned the starting spot for the Terriers. In just her second start, she had her first shutout\u2014a 5-0 win over New Hampshire.\n\nShanahan wasn\u2019t expecting to play meaningful minutes so early in her BU career. \u201cI went into the season having low expectations, knowing that I had to work my way up, as any freshman does,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was super cool getting to play in a playoff game my freshman year and getting the nod as a starter in the second half of the season.\u201d She was unanimously named to the Hockey East All-Rookie Team at season\u2019s end.\n\nInjuries and mental strength\n\nIn her sophomore season, however, Shanahan lost her starting position in net, which she attributes to a \u201cdip in confidence.\u201d She says she wanted to \u201cwork her butt off the following summer\u201d in order to win back her starting spot.\n\n\u201cIt was so cool to hear her reflections when [she lost her starting position] and how she struggled with that and how she grew from that,\u201d Watchorn says. \u201cThe mental strength that she really grew with throughout the entire experience you see in her game today.\u201d\n\nWatchorn first met Shanahan while she was an assistant coach at BU, as part of the goaltender\u2019s recruiting process. By the time Shanahan made her way to Comm Ave, Watchorn was head coach at Stonehill. When she was named BU\u2019s head coach in 2023, the two were reunited.\n\n\u201cShe is just so passionate and outgoing when you first meet her,\u201d Watchorn says, recalling that recruiting meeting. \u201cTo see her after a few years and how she settled into such a leadership role and was someone who was respected by her teammates\u2026spoke to her maturity and growth.\u201d\n\nShanahan stopping a puck during the Women\u2019s Beanpot Championship game January 21, 2025, at TD Garden. She helped lead the BU women\u2019s ice hockey team to back-to-back Beanpot championship game appearances. Photo by Matt Woolverton/BU Athletics\n\nThe summer before her junior season, Shanahan dislocated her knee at a USA Hockey goalie training camp. She opted for physical therapy as opposed to surgery\u2014a six-week solution over a six-month one. When she returned to BU for training, she reinjured the knee on the third skate of the season. This time there was no choice.\n\nThe months spent on the sidelines were the longest Shanahan had ever been off the ice. Watchorn notes that the Terrier junior continued to be a great teammate, acknowledging the isolation and \u201csilent work ethic\u201d involved with such an injury. \u201cIt was a really tough pill to swallow,\u201d Shanahan says. \u201cThe thing that kept me going is that I knew I would eventually get my time to shine.\u201d\n\nThe thing that kept me going is that I knew I would eventually get my time to shine.\n\nThe first time she put her skates back on, the entire team stood on the other side of the glass, banging on it and cheering for their goaltender. She finally made her return to competition on January 12, 2024. Four days later, she led the team to a statement win over Boston College in the Beanpot semifinal.\n\n\u201cIt was really cool to see her work for those months after the surgery and work through her feelings and the setback,\u201d says teammate and best friend Liv Haag (CAS\u201925). \u201cIt was like she never had those months off.\u201d\n\nNow in her senior and final season at BU, Shanahan is playing some of the best hockey of her career. She\u2019s played the most games of her collegiate career, posting a career-best 1.78 goals-against average and a tie for her career-best save percentage at .925. On top of that, she is an assistant captain for a team making an unprecedented turnaround.\n\nHer father has now reached the point where he takes pointers from her on how to improve his own game.\n\n\u201cOne day you can be on the ice and the next it can be taken away from you,\u201d Shanahan says. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to soak up every day and every moment I\u2019m with my team on and off the ice because someday it\u2019s going to be over.\u201d\n\nShe now has the opportunity to put an extra exclamation point on her BU career, starting with Saturday\u2019s Hockey East quarterfinal game. After that, she hopes to be drafted to the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League, with the ultimate goal: the Olympics. Eventually, she wants to go to graduate school, but she acknowledges that she\u2019s not yet ready to give up hockey.\n\n\u201cI just appreciate her energy every day\u2026 I\u2019m grateful for every day, and I can say she brings the best out of me,\u201d Watchorn says. \u201cShe\u2019s a model for the way this program needs to go.\u201d\n\nFans can catch Callie Shanahan in action when the BU women\u2019s hockey team takes on Vermont in the Hockey East quarterfinals on Saturday, March 1, at Walter Brown Arena.

(NYSE:UPS) stands against other best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAfter much suspense, the US Federal Reserve finally began cutting interest rates in late 2024, dropping the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in two cuts in September and November, with the market expecting further cuts this year. The Fed\u2019s decision came in reaction to falling US inflation and employment market statistics, which suggested that the elusive soft landing was still within reach. However, as February comes to a close, things appear to have changed. For the time being, the Federal Open Market Committee is projected to leave interest rates unchanged on March 19. That\u2019s because the labor market looks to be strong, and inflation is still over goal and slightly increasing. The FOMC\u2019s most recent meeting in January also said that \u201crespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed,\u201d implying that any reduction (if at all) will occur sometime later in 2025.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the 65-and-older population in the United States will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when it is expected to account for more than a quarter of the total population. The World Economic Forum further predicts that half of kids born in the United States in 2007 would survive to the age of 103. As such, wages seem to be falling behind inflation as people live longer lives. That\u2019s especially true now that businesses have moved the burden of retirement savings to employees, giving 401(k)s instead of pensions that promise a fixed income each month.\n\nOne dilemma many face as they approach retirement is how much money they will need to live comfortably when they stop working. According to Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the average retiree household in the United States spends around $5,000 per month. With a median 401(k) balance of $210,724 for those aged 60 to 69, implementing the 4% withdrawal rule yields around $702 per month\u2014which, when combined with the average monthly Social Security payment of $1,976, still falls short of meeting basic needs. According to Dan Doonan, executive director of the National Institute on Retirement Security, non-wealthy workers still have insufficient retirement coverage, forcing them to save on their own:",

She said the program has been lifesaving.\n\n\u201cLearning who I am as a person, getting to know myself again; learning to love myself,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring her time at Hotel Louisville, Hopper has learned about the organizations supporting those in treatment and those struggling with homelessness.\n\nWith light snow and temperatures in the 20s, this delivery was timely, though the items UPS has brought will help individuals year-round.\n\nSince 2021, UPS employees have been collecting and donating new socks to Wayside Christian Mission, which, in return, distributes them to individuals and organizations around the city.\n\n\u201cOur folks walk all day long,\" said Nina Moseley, Wayside executive director. \"It\u2019s important that they keep their feet dry, clean, in good condition and the socks help prevent frostbite, infection.\"\n\n\u201cThey go to us, they go to shelters, they got to many places that need them,\u201d Hopper said.\n\nIt took the better part of an hour for volunteers to unload 48,000 new socks packaged up in dozens of boxes. There were winter socks, children\u2019s socks, socks for every occasion and they are needed.\n\nAaron Jones hands out socks throughout the year while visiting people living on the street.\n\n\u201cAnd with these socks, we can go out into the community with the Good Samaritan Patrol,\" Jones said. \"That is people out in the cold. We can give them socks, blankets and other necessities that they need. These are people who don\u2019t want to come into the shelter.\"\n\nNicole Hopper said she has a brighter outlook every day and the donations remind her that people care.",

            "content": "BOSTON \u2014 The first goal of the game was a reminder of Mason Lohrei\u2019s potential. His elite vision and terrific skill.\n\nThe last goal of the game \u2014 Mitch Marner\u2019s overtime strike that gave Toronto a 5-4 win over the Bruins \u2014 was a reminder that for all his potential, Lohrei is still a 24-year-old figuring out how to play in the NHL.\n\nUP NEXT WHO: New York Islanders at Boston Bruins WHEN: 7 p.m. Thursday TELEVISION: NESN\n\nThe Bruins are getting the full spectrum of the Mason Lohrei experience in 2024-25. On Tuesday, he was on the ice for five goals \u2014 two for the Bruins that he assisted on and three for the Leafs.\n\nWhen the Bruins are at full strength, Lohrei\u2019s evolution is a little more natural. But with Hampus Lindholm done for the season and Charlie McAvoy out indefinitely, Boston has been forced to give Lohrei more minutes and in more crucial spots and hope that the birdies outweigh the bogeys.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an opportunity. I want to do the best with the extra time I\u2019m getting with those guys being out,\u201d Lohrei said.\n\nJust 29 seconds into Tuesday\u2019s game, he surveyed the ice and saw David Pastrnak with a step on the Toronto defense. He threaded a perfect pass to the Bruins forward, who scored easily on the breakaway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat was a world-class pass,\u201d Pastrnak said. \u201cI was surprised. It landed right on my stick.\u201d\n\nBut in overtime, Lohrei was caught leaning the wrong way as the Leafs tried to clear the zone. It was the second time in the game he\u2019d made the wrong decision whether to be aggressive or cautious.\n\nThe first one led to a penalty in the second period. On an attempted clear, Lohrei started backpedaling but then changed his mind and shifted forward, attempting to keep the puck in.\n\nHe was late and ended up being called for cross-checking Marner leaving the zone.\n\nOnly he knows if that was in his mind in overtime when he was aggressive right away trying to keep the puck in.\n\nBut this time he should have retreated against the Maple Leafs\u2019 top two forwards. With Pastrnak and Pavel Zacha stuck deep in the zone, Lohrei leaned, trying to reach and redirect the puck back into the zone. That left him with no momentum to get back when he wasn\u2019t successful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur defenseman was caught up a little in between there whether to move up or stay back. They pushed it by him,\u201d Bruins interim coach Joe Sacco said.\n\nAuston Matthews tapped a pass to Marner, who finished his breakaway as easily as Pastrnak did.\n\nSacco didn\u2019t want to blame Lohrei.\n\n\u201cThree-on-three hockey has a couple of breakdowns here and there,\u201d Sacco said. \u201cMason did a lot of great things tonight. Especially early on, he was ready to play.\u201d\n\nLohrei is trying to stay even and keep his eye on his goals through the ups and downs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough. I know what kind of player I am, what kind of player I want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying every day. I want to be that guy who creates a lot and doesn\u2019t give up anything. I\u2019m just trying to continue to work at that. It\u2019s all I can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep my confidence and go out and make the next play,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can\u2019t lose your confidence if something bad happens. It\u2019s a game of mistakes, but I have to limit them.\u201d\n\nFREDERIC INJURED: In a development that could impact the trade deadline, Bruins forward Trent Frederic left Tuesday\u2019s game against Toronto with an apparent leg injury.\n\nFrederic skated off awkwardly after a collision with Jake McCabe in the offense corner, 4:11 into the second period.\n\nHe went to the bench and then the dressing room. There was no immediate update on his status.\n\nFrederic\u2019s absence could affect the Bruins\u2019 trade deadline situation. Frederic is among the Boston players most likely to get moved.\n\nHe\u2019s an unrestricted free agent at season\u2019s end. Frederic could offer a contender a big physical presence with a history of making an offensive impact and could potentially benefit from a change of scenery in the midst of a down year",

If you\u2019ve ever missed those suspenseful moments when your Sim\u2019s peaceful night was interrupted by tense music and a sneaky presence, we\u2019ve got great news: the Burglar is back! And the best part? It\u2019s in the base game, so it\u2019s free for everyone with today\u2019s update.\n\nThe Burglar is an iconic Sim featured in The Sims, The Sims 2, and The Sims 3 who sneaks into houses, usually at night when Sims are asleep, to steal household items. As a longtime Sims player, I have wanted to bring the Burglar to The Sims 4. You could say I\u2019ve been stealing moments to pitch this idea from the very start! ** Even during my job interview, I asked \u201cWhat would it take to bring the Burglar back?\u201d Now, The Sims team can proudly say the Burglar is back just in time for our 25th Birthday, shipping alongside The Sims 4 Businesses & Hobbies Expansion Pack. \u2014and trust me, it\u2019s worth the wait.\n\nEverything you need to know about the Burglar\n\nSo, how does the Burglar operate in The Sims 4? Here\u2019s what you need to know. The infamous Robin Banks (yep, that\u2019s her name\u2014we couldn\u2019t resist) only strikes at night, sneaking into your Sim\u2019s home while everyone is fast asleep (or even if they are awake!). Before you know it, she\u2019ll be grabbing whatever\u2019s valuable and making her escape.\n\nHow to foil that midnight mischief\n\nThe Burglar can be arrested by the police if one of your Sims calls promptly. For those who want to play it safe, the Burglar Alarm is back too! Place one in your Sim\u2019s home for extra protection because the only way to guarantee the police get to the crime scene in time is by installing a Burglar Alarm. Handy Sims can upgrade the alarm to do all sorts of useful things: automatically call the police, reduce the chance of it breaking, or even zap the Burglar, forcing her to drop the stolen goods.\n\nPrefer to handle the situation yourself? No problem\u2014your Sims can take action whether it\u2019s waking up to call the cops (who may or may not catch the thief) or getting into a one-on-one fight, your Sims have options. Pro tip: Sims who\u2019ve been hitting the gym have a better chance of winning those fights!\n\nSpecial Sims can unleash new defenses\n\nStopping the Burglar will feel unique depending on who\u2019s in the household. Special Sims bring even more exciting possibilities.\n\nHave a dog? They\u2019ll chase the Burglar right out. (Requires: The Sims 4 Cats & Dogs Expansion Pack)\n\nWerewolves can intimidate the Burglar into leaving. (Requires: The Sims 4 Werewolves Game Pack )\n\nSpellcasters? They\u2019ve got everything from confusion spells to full-on transformations. (Requires: The Sims 4 Realm of Magic Game Pack)\n\nServos can zap the Burglar into place with their defense matrix. (Requires: The Sims 4 Discover University Expansion Pack)\n\nScientists can use the Freeze Ray to immobilize them. (Requires: The Sims 4 Get to Work Expansion Pack)\n\nVampires, of course, might take advantage of the situation for a quick warm-blooded snack before commanding the Burglar to leave. (Requires: The Sims 4 Vampires Game Pack)\n\nEven Sims without superpowers have fun reactions. Teenagers might stop to take a selfie with the Burglar before bolting to safety. Talk about stealing the spotlight!\n\nIconic characters like Agnes Crumplebottom and Bonehilda won\u2019t run\u2014they\u2019re ready to fight! In total, we\u2019ve included over 50 unique reactions across the base game and 17 different packs, along with 37 player-directed interactions. Who knew a bit of thievery could add so much character to your game?\n\nBurglar visits are rare because we want those moments to stand out. But for those of you who thrive on chaos, we\u2019ve got you covered with the new Lot Challenge, Heist Havoc. Turn this on, and not only will the Burglar visit more often, but even trusty Alarms might start acting up. You\u2019ve been warned!\n\nWe are so thrilled to finally bring the Burglar back into The Sims universe. Sending a special shout out to our full team for making this a reality. Robin Banks isn\u2019t just ready to rob your Sims\u2019 houses\u2014she\u2019s here to steal your hearts too! What better way to celebrate The Sims 25th Birthday than with this nostalgic yet fresh addition? We hope you\u2019re as excited as we are to see what kind of chaos Robin Banks will bring to your households.\n\nDag Dag,\n\nX\u00e8nia\n\nFAQ\n\nDo I need to own Business & Hobbies to get the Burglar in-game?\n\nNo, the Burglar update will be available to all Simmers as part of today\u2019s base game update!\n\nIs there anything new with how the Burglar works in The Sims 4?\n\nThere are quite a few new updates with how the Burglar works in The Sims 4! First, there will be updated music accompanying the Burglar when they spawn on your lot. In addition, there is the new Heist Havoc Lot Challenge that will spawn the Burglar on your lot at a higher rate.\n\nSimilar to before, Burglar Alarms can be installed on Sims\u2019 lots to help keep their belongings safe, but now you can upgrade the alarm to reduce the chance of it breaking, automatically call the police, or even zap the Burglar! In addition, you\u2019ll be able to upgrade your Burglar Alarms so they break less often.\n\nIn addition, Sims can now take justice into their own hands, and special Sims can unleash their own defenses, as we\u2019ve outlined in our dev diary!\n\nAre any new items or functionality coming to the base game to support the Burglar? (e.g. Burglar Alarms, Smart Cameras, etc.)\n\nPolice Officers will be returning to the game to help tackle those pesky Burglars! You will also be able to install Burglar Alarms on tour Sims\u2019 Residential or Small Business Venue (in the Businesses & Hobbies Expansion Pack) lots to keep their belongings safe.\n\nIs there anything that the Burglar can\u2019t steal?\n\nMost build objects cannot be stolen \u2013 such as outdoor plants that are planted directly in the ground, windows, lights, elevators, etc.\n\nCan you befriend Robin Banks?\n\nYes, you will be able to interact with and befriend Robin Banks! You can even add Robin Banks to your household. If you do this, another Burglar will generate to take Robin\u2019s place, or a Sim that already exists in the world with the right traits who is unplayed can fulfill the role. New burglars will spawn with the same traits but a random appearance and name.\n\nCan Robin Banks die? If so, will she regenerate?\n\nYes, Robin Banks can die, but she won\u2019t regenerate. Similar to Father Winter there will be a new Burglar with similar traits that will be randomly generated if this happens.",

            "content": "One of the most intriguing investment propositions in the industrial sector, UPS (UPS 1.33%), is a battleground stock for bulls and bears. Although the company has disappointed investors in recent years, it's making underlying progress in its medium-term strategy, and a turnaround could be under way in 2025. Here's what you need to know before buying the stock.\n\nThe bears' case for UPS\n\nIt's been a difficult couple of years for UPS. For two years running, management has overestimated the strength of the U.S. small package delivery market. In addition, UPS had a protracted and costly labor dispute in 2023. Customers switched to other networks in fear of strike action, and costs associated with the ultimately agreed-upon new contract hit UPS's margins.\n\nMoreover, investors have reason to doubt management. Last year, the company held an investor and analyst day, during which management reiterated its full-year 2024 guidance and laid out its plans for the next three years.\n\nA few months later, management slashed its full-year guidance on its earnings call in July, Itended 2024 nowhere near the guidance laid out in March.\n\nMetric Guidance for 2024 at Investor Day (March 2023) Actual 2024 Consolidated revenue $92 billion to $94.5 billion $91.1 billion Consolidated adjusted operating income $9.2 billion to $10 billion $8.9 billion\n\nMoreover, after laying out its three-year strategic plan in March 2023, management has departed from it with its momentous decision to reduce its Amazon.com delivery volume, which was responsible for 11.8% of total company revenue in 2024, by 50% by the second half of 2026. It's a change that will require good execution in terms of network readjustments and cost-cutting, and given the difficulties in meeting guidance in recent years and the abrupt change of plans, investors have cause for concern.\n\nThe bulls' case for UPS\n\nThe bullish argument for buying the stock rests on the following:\n\nThe U.S. small package market will eventually improve, and the overcapacity in the marketplace will reduce over time.\n\nUPS is making demonstrable progress in expanding into key targeted markets, such as healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\nThe reduction in Amazon volumes is entirely in tune with management's operating philosophy of maximizing the profitability of its deliveries rather than chasing volume in itself.\n\nAs the three-year plan outlines, UPS is building the \"network of the future\" by investing in automation and smart facilities. It makes sense to do so while structuring its network for fewer Amazon deliveries now rather than later.\n\nThe overcapacity issue is a hangover from when package delivery companies significantly expanded their networks in response to the boom in demand created by the lockdown measures. As such, it's likely to prove temporary, and industry delivery volume will grow with an improving economy.\n\nMeanwhile, UPS continues to make progress in higher-margin targeted areas and expects the SMB share of its U.S. volume to hit 32% in 2025, compared to just 27% in 2021. In addition, there's no change to management's plan to double its healthcare-related revenue from $10 billion in 2023 to $20 billion in 2026.\n\nThese are successful initiatives, and despite the issues with the U.S. small package delivery market, management has delivered on them.\n\nFinally, the technology investments implicit in the \"network of the future\" are intended to improve productivity and allow the transportation company to close facilities handling deliveries that can now be processed in super-efficient facilities. That's a significant plus in itself, and it dovetails with the need to realign its network in light of the reduction in Amazon volumes.\n\nA stock to buy?\n\nOn balance, a weak, bullish approach makes sense. UPS is improving in the areas it wants to improve in, but there are question marks about executing its plan to lower Amazon volumes that will take time to answer fully. In addition, UPS management needs to steady the ship regarding meeting guidance.\n\nThat said, the shift toward higher-margin deliveries is why many investors bought into UPS stock in the first place, and the Amazon adjustment makes perfect sense. Management deserves the benefit of the doubt, and the risk/reward calculation suggests the stock is a buy, not least because of the underlying progress in healthcare and SMBs.",

            "content": "A new review published in Genes & Diseases explores the pivotal role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and driving cancer progression. The study provides novel insights into how ubiquitination and deubiquitination impact tumor cells, immune responses, and potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.\n\nThe tumor microenvironment is a complex ecosystem of tumor cells, immune cells, and non-cellular components, creating a dynamic interplay that influences cancer development. The study highlights that ubiquitination, a key post-translational protein modification process, is essential for maintaining protein stability and regulating various cellular processes such as cell growth, DNA replication, immune responses, and energy metabolism.\n\nOne of the key findings of this review is how the UPS system controls tumor cell proliferation, immune evasion, and metastasis. Multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that regulate essential cancer-related proteins were identified. For instance, the study outlines the role of MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53, a well-known tumor suppressor protein. Dysregulation of MDM2 leads to uncontrolled tumor growth, making it a promising target for anti-cancer therapy.\n\nFurthermore, the study delves into the UPS's impact on immune cells in the TME. Ubiquitination modifications can either promote or suppress immune responses, directly affecting cancer immunotherapy outcomes. The review discusses how targeting PD-1/PD-L1 ubiquitination can enhance T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, a critical finding for improving checkpoint inhibitor therapies.\n\nThe authors also explore how the UPS influences non-immune components of the TME, such as tumor-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), macrophages, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). By regulating protein degradation and signaling pathways, the UPS contributes to angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and tumor cell migration. These findings open new avenues for developing UPS-targeted drugs that could disrupt cancer-supportive environments.\n\nWhile the therapeutic potential of targeting UPS is immense, this review also acknowledges the challenges of developing effective inhibitors. Existing UPS-targeted drugs, such as proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib), have shown clinical success in treating multiple myeloma. However, new strategies, including PROTAC, aim to enhance specificity and reduce toxicity in solid tumors.\n\nThis study underscores the UPS as a critical regulator of cancer progression and a promising therapeutic target. Future research will focus on developing selective inhibitors and combination therapies to improve cancer treatment outcomes.",

The senior received the accolade after winning two individual events and breaking the 100 breaststroke NCAA record. He was also part of two winning relay teams as well as the 400 medley relay who smashed the NCAA record on Friday night.Throughout the six days of competition, the Gators totaled 29 medals, 15 of which were gold. Additionally, Florida broke 46 records, including two NCAA records, 13 program, 11 SEC Meet, 11 pool, six SEC, two US Open and one American. Additionally, 25 NCAA A-cuts were recorded throughout the final events.Florida had several Gators capture two event tiles, asandtook home two individual gold medals. On the women's side,led the way with two gold in both backstroke events, while Monroy won the first event of the week in the 1-Meter, whiledefended her title in the 400 IM for the third-straight year.On how happy she was with her time and how swimming the 200 back felt:\"I was talking about how the 200 back is one of the most painful 200's. It hurt so bad, but best time and I am always happy with a best time.\"On being the fifth-fasest performer ever and swimming next to the defending Olympic gold medalist (Hubert Kos of Texas):\"I knew it was going to be fast and that he was coming from me, so I knew I had to set myself up for success and get out as far ahead as I could.\"On how he carries his momentum in the backstroke into next month at NCAA's:\"Just celebrating the success here and keep it as a chip on our shoulder as we go through the next month of training and what not. I know when I get back on Monday its not going to be a taper, so keep that same grit I had in the fall and keep the confidence as well.There were eight program top-ten times recorded and three NCAA A-cut times recorded during morning prelims, as 21 swimmers advanced to Saturday finals.The 1650 free opened Saturday finals, as 10 Gators competed in the event.(14:53.23) and(16:02.53) went four-five on the women's side, respectively.finished in 11th after swimming a 16:09.69.had the fastest time on the men's side after going 14:47.44 in the second heat.14:48.46 followed in tenth, while(14:49.56) and(14:51.03) placed 12th and 14th, respectively.andadded points to Florida's team total as well, finishing in 21st (14:56.84) and 22nd (15:01.05), respectively.For the second-consecutive day,andswept the backstroke event, as the two sophomores defended their title in the 200 back, Sims posted a winning time of 1:48.28 to win the event in over two seconds to improve her school record time of 1:48.47 from last year's NCAA Championships. Marshall followed up with a school record and SEC Meet record time of 1:35.85 to defeat defending Olympic gold medalist Hubert Kos of Texas and maintain his title.In the men's 100 free,tied with Jordan Crooks of Tennessee for first place, finishing at 40.45 for an SEC Meet record and his second-straight event title.

            "content": "A new review published in Genes & Diseases explores the pivotal role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and driving cancer progression. The study provides novel insights into how ubiquitination and deubiquitination impact tumor cells, immune responses, and potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.\n\nThe tumor microenvironment is a complex ecosystem of tumor cells, immune cells, and non-cellular components, creating a dynamic interplay that influences cancer development. The study highlights that ubiquitination, a key post-translational protein modification process, is essential for maintaining protein stability and regulating various cellular processes such as cell growth, DNA replication, immune responses, and energy metabolism.\n\nOne of the key findings of this review is how the UPS system controls tumor cell proliferation, immune evasion, and metastasis. Multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that regulate essential cancer-related proteins were identified. For instance, the study outlines the role of MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53, a well-known tumor suppressor protein. Dysregulation of MDM2 leads to uncontrolled tumor growth, making it a promising target for anti-cancer therapy.\n\nFurthermore, the study delves into the UPS's impact on immune cells in the TME. Ubiquitination modifications can either promote or suppress immune responses, directly affecting cancer immunotherapy outcomes. The review discusses how targeting PD-1/PD-L1 ubiquitination can enhance T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, a critical finding for improving checkpoint inhibitor therapies.\n\nThe authors also explore how the UPS influences non-immune components of the TME, such as tumor-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), macrophages, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). By regulating protein degradation and signaling pathways, the UPS contributes to angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and tumor cell migration. These findings open new avenues for developing UPS-targeted drugs that could disrupt cancer-supportive environments.\n\nWhile the therapeutic potential of targeting UPS is immense, this review also acknowledges the challenges of developing effective inhibitors. Existing UPS-targeted drugs, such as proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib), have shown clinical success in treating multiple myeloma. However, new strategies, including PROTAC, aim to enhance specificity and reduce toxicity in solid tumors.\n\nThis study underscores the UPS as a critical regulator of cancer progression and a promising therapeutic target. Future research will focus on developing selective inhibitors and combination therapies to improve cancer treatment outcomes.",

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nView our latest analysis for Kronos Bio\n\nKronos Bio Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Director Norbert Bischofberger made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.1m worth of shares at a price of US$1.24 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$1.00. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Norbert Bischofberger.\n\nNorbert Bischofberger purchased 3.62m shares over the year. The average price per share was US$1.06. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNasdaqGS:KRON Insider Trading Volume February 23rd 2025\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Kronos Bio insiders own 29% of the company, worth about US$17m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Kronos Bio Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThe fact that there have been no Kronos Bio insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Insiders do have a stake in Kronos Bio and their transactions don't cause us concern. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Kronos Bio and we suggest you have a look.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The average startup costs of home-based startups, including franchises, range from $2,000 to $5,000. Permanent business closures are often the direct result of the startup\u2019s inability to meet expenses.\n\nThis section discusses significant startup costs statistics for new businesses.\n\nKey Statistics\n\nStartups in online retail, accounting, landscaping, and construction typically have startup costs of up to $5,000 .\n\n. Healthcare providers, restaurants, and manufacturing companies are among the most expensive startup companies and usually require more than $100,000 to launch.\n\nto launch.

The relatively high startup failure rates are due to various reasons, with the most significant being the absence of a product-market fit, poor marketing strategy formulation and implementation, and cash flow problems.\n\nWhy do entrepreneurs fail? In most cases, a business fails due to multiple reasons.\n\nFor example, suppose the startup owner fails to draw up a comprehensive business plan or build a business model that seems sustainable over the long run. In that case, the startup might lose money, encounter operational issues, and run into legal problems.\n\nInsufficient marketing is another major reason for the high business failure rates. A sound marketing strategy allows startups to strategically share offers with a target audience and present their products and services as a solution to prospective customers\u2019 problems.\n\nHowever, if no market exists for the startup\u2019s product or service, even the most creative and well-executed marketing strategy will fail. Extensive market research is crucial to ensure that there is a product-market fit.\n\nWant to Uncover\n\nYour True Audience ? \ud83d\udd0e Get My Free Report \ud83d\udc49\n\nSuccessful startups also encounter issues with product-market fit. However, the startup teams in these businesses do extensive market research, and they incorporate effective marketing strategies while adhering to a marketing budget.\n\nCash flow problems contribute significantly to the business failure rate in the United States. Most entrepreneurs who launch with insufficient funding, product or service prices that are not market-related, or optimistic sales projections end up with a failing startup.\n\nIn some cases, a startup fails because the founders don\u2019t have the necessary qualifications or experience. Ideally, entrepreneurs should be industry experts with sufficient business experience.\n\nWhat are the most common reasons for failed startups? The statistics below provide some insight into the top reasons startups fail.\n\nKey Statistics\n\n34% of startup failures are due to a poor product-market fit.\n\n22% of failed businesses didn\u2019t implement the correct marketing strategies.\n\n18% of startups fail due to team problems and other human-resource-related issues.\n\n16% of failures in the startup world are the result of cash flow problems and other financial issues.\n\n6% of startup failures are due to tech-related problems, including poor cyber security and outdated solutions.\n\n2% of startups fail due to sub-optimal operations.\n\n2% of startups fail due to legal problems, such as issues with licensing, registering an unsuitable entity structure, and failing to formulate a partnership agreement that protects the interests of each co-founder.\n\nSources: Failory, Business News Daily, Investopedia, CB Insights, Review 42\n\nStartup Funding + Investor Facts\n\nStartup Failure Rate by Stage / What Percentage of Venture-Backed Startups Fail\n\nWhat percentage of venture-backed startups fail? Generally speaking, for every ten venture-backed startups, around three companies fail, four businesses manage to repay the investment amount, and one business survives while generating sustainable returns.\n\nAccording to Forbes, less than 1% of small businesses in the United States receive funding from venture capital (VC) firms to cover costs. On the other hand, around 26% of European startup founders rely on VC funding.\n\nWhat percentage of venture capital investments fail? Below are statistics relating to venture-backed companies.\n\nKey Statistics\n\nOn average, a single VC firm receives more than 1,000 proposals per year.\n\nAround 25% of new businesses don\u2019t receive all of the funding required to launch, thus restricting their sustainable growth.\n\nOn average, credit card debt, business loans, and lines of credit amount to 75% of new business financing.\n\nAround 30% of all venture-backed startups fail.\n\nSources: Scale Finance, Statista, Forbes, Money Crashers, National Small Business Association, Fundera\n\nFor Idea-stage Startups:\n\nGenerally, the startup failure rate by stage decreases with every round of funding. The Startup Genome Project found the following about idea-stage startups:\n\nEarly-stage startups need to spend up to 3x longer validating their target markets than their founders anticipate. One of the aims of the more extended market validation period is to prevent cash flow issues from running the project into the ground before the startup has the chance to determine the market-product fit.\n\nStartup founders tend to overestimate the company\u2019s intellectual property by up to 255%.\n\nEarly-stage startups can increase user growth by up to 3.6x and generate 2.5x more returns by pivoting once or twice. Startups that don\u2019t pivot or pivot more than two times tend not to perform optimally.\n\nDuring the idea stage, the primary objective should be to establish a product-market fit. Using the lean startup methodology, business owners need to optimally validate the market using time and resources, giving themselves sufficient leeway to pivot.\n\nSources: The Lean Startup Methodology, Startup Genome\n\nFor Later-stage Startups:\n\nAccording to the Startup Genome Project, the four startup stages include:\n\nDiscovery Validation Efficiency Scale\n\nLater-stage startups that scale prematurely are inconsistent and more likely to fail. Premature scaling involves investing too many resources during the first stages of the startup journey, increasing the failure rate.\n\nAccording to the statistics of the Startup Genome Project, inconsistent later-stage startups scale prematurely by doing the following:\n\nGenerating three times more capital during the efficiency stage and 18 times less capital during the scale stage.\n\nSelf-reporting valuations of $10 million before they reach the scale phase.

Starting a new business that ends up failing can also cost entrepreneurs valuable time that they could have used to build a lucrative career or another source of income.\n\nSmall business trends relating to startup failure rates are bleak and often discourage would-be entrepreneurs from launching new ventures. When considering how many entrepreneurs fail, launching a startup doesn\u2019t appear to be a financially viable option for anyone.\n\nHowever, the goal of failure statistics is not to discourage budding entrepreneurs. Instead, these figures aim to help small businesses mitigate their risks and build the one in ten businesses that survive and achieve growth over the long run.\n\nLaunching a new startup is not a gamble but a calculated risk that startup owners can manage successfully. Various concrete reasons exist for the high failure rate among new businesses.\n\nStartup founders need to understand the reasons that startups fail and implement all necessary measures to avoid the pitfalls that most businesses encounter.\n\nSource: Failory\n\nFailure Rate Implications for Startup Investors\n\nWhen considering how many startups go out of business, one might wonder how startup investors can be profitable. In short, investors attempt to conduct their investment in a manner that allows successful startups to offset the losses of the startups that fail.\n\nStartup investors are generally up to date on how many new businesses succeed and how many fail. Venture capital investor failure costs can be high, especially in the case of sizable investments.\n\nConsequently, these investors go to great lengths to ensure that they minimize their investments in potentially unsuccessful companies. Before investing, an investment firm will typically scrutinize the startup\u2019s business plan to determine its potential return on investment.\n\nInvestors consider various factors before giving startups money in exchange for ownership:\n\nThe startup\u2019s past financial performance\n\nThe size and validity of the startup\u2019s target market\n\nAll data-based financial projections\n\nAll sales channels and their effectiveness in reaching the target audience\n\nExisting and potential future competitors in the market\n\nThe projected timeline for generating returns\n\nPotential pitfalls and the owner\u2019s modus operandi for addressing them\n\nInvestors will typically only invest in businesses with a unique idea and clear-cut investment structure.\n\nSource: Failory\n\nStartup Failure Rate by Industry and Sector\n\nStatistics for Fintech Startups\n\nFinancial technology (fintech) startups combine technology and innovation to deliver conventional financial solutions. Successful fintech startups tend to base their operations on continuous user testing and information-based iteration. These startups support organizations in banking, accounting, and other relevant industries.\n\nThe national percentage of fintech businesses that fail is relatively low compared to the startup crash rates in other industries, including startups in Silicon Valley.\n\nKey Fintech Startup Statistics\n\nThe fintech startup failure rate for venture capital-backed businesses is 75%.\n\nGlobal fintech investments by venture capital firms increased from $1.8 billion in 2011 to $30.8 billion in 2018.\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry receives $50 billion in investments per year.\n\nApproximately 80% of all financial institutions in the United States are partners with fintech service providers.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 8,775 fintech startups in the United States.\n\nAt a value of $131 billion, the Ant Group is the largest fintech company globally.\n\nThe global fintech industry was valued at $310 billion in 2022.\n\nSources: The Fintech Mag, McKinsey & Company Report, Balancing Everything\n\nStatistics for Technology Startups\n\nSome of the best-known tech companies include Google, Facebook, and Apple - all of which were startups at some point.\n\nThe profitability and profile of these tech giants attract large numbers of entrants to the market. However, the tech industry has multiple pitfalls, and the tech startup failure rate is significantly higher than the crash rate of other industries.\n\nTech Startup Statistics\n\nAt 63%, the percentage of tech businesses that fail within the first five years is relatively high.\n\nEvery year in the United States, 20 tech companies launch that will go on to generate $100 million in revenues.\n\nThe average age of a tech startup founder in the United States is 39.\n\nAt a value of $1.6 trillion, the United States has the most significant technology market in the world.\n\nTech companies pay employees an average of $102,000 per year \u2014 more than double the United States average.\n\nSources: Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, Forbes, Embroker\n\nStatistics for Real Estate Startups\n\nThe real estate sector is among the most significant industries in the world. In the United States, real estate transactions contribute significantly to the GDP, and the industry is one of the most attractive for startups.\n\nReal estate startups include businesses providing conventional real estate services and proptech (property technology) startups. As with the tech industry, the real estate startup failure rate is relatively high.\n\nReal Estate Startup Statistics\n\nThe percentage of real estate businesses that fail within four years is 48%.\n\nReal estate startups in the United States generated $1.9 billion during 2019.\n\nResidential real estate startups that incorporate artificial intelligence into their offers attract the most investments.\n\nOffice-sharing startups attract the most VC funds of all real estate startups.

So it's hard to tell them, \u2018Hey, I'm in a lot of pain.\u2019 They're like, \u2018Okay, cool. Go get this blood work.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm like, 'Okay, but that's going to take you like a week [to get the results back]. I'm in excruciating pain.

            "content": "A month ago, Elon Musk rang in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term with a straight-arm salute that divided a political nation. Was it meant to be a Nazi salute? Just an awkward gesture? Or was it a deliberate provocation meant to spur all of this debate \u2014 and attention?\n\nFast forward a month, and longtime Trump ally Stephen K. Bannon on Thursday offered a very similar gesture at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). He, like Musk, denies it was intended to evoke Nazism. But the leader of France\u2019s far-right party saw fit to cancel his own planned CPAC speech over Bannon\u2019s \u201cgesture alluding to Nazi ideology.\u201d\n\nThese episodes by prominent Trump allies just a month apart would suggest this is indeed a provocation, at the very least. And it would have plenty of precedent; right-wingers in recent years have deliberately provoked similar debates with the \u201cOkay\u201d hand sign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to the extent it is a provocation, it would have plenty of recent company from the Trump team.\n\nTrump and his top allies appear increasingly consumed with trolling their opponents \u2014 real and perceived \u2014 as they run the country. Trying to \u201cown the libs,\u201d or offend the left in the name of appearing dominant, has become a central plank of their political efforts.\n\nTrump has long done this, but now many of his allies appear to be in on it.\n\nThis week, it took the form of poking at critics of Trump\u2019s very real attempts to consolidate power.\n\nAmid a series of such moves and chatter about his potentially defying judges\u2019 rulings, Trump decided to post and repeatedly promote a quote often attributed to a dictator, Napoleon Bonaparte: \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that predictably blew up, Trump promoted his attempted ban on congestion pricing in New York City by saying, \u201cLONG LIVE THE KING!\u201d Amid yet more criticism of that, the White House posted a mock magazine cover with that quote and a crown on Trump\u2019s head. A White House spokesperson offered a similar post.\n\n\"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!\"\n\n\u2013President Donald J. Trump pic.twitter.com/IMr4tq0sMB \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 19, 2025\n\nTrump has for weeks been calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u201cGovernor Trudeau\u201d \u2014 a reference to Trump\u2019s talk about making Canada the 51st state. By Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed a hockey game between the countries by saying the White House looked \u201cforward to the United States beating our soon-to-be 51st state, Canada.\u201d\n\nCanadians regard the 51st-state talk as far from a joke and even insulting, as Trump considers potentially crippling tariffs on its imports. The idea is hugely unpopular in both Canada and the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso this week, the White House X account posted an un-narrated video of chained undocumented immigrants being deported, as loud ambient noise played in the background. The title: \u201cASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.\u201d\n\nASMR stands for \u201cautonomous sensory meridian response.\u201d The allusion was to internet videos meant to create a positive sensory response.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only time White House social media accounts have posted this kind of content, which would seem just as at-home on right-wing internet message boards. One post on Valentine\u2019s Day read, \u201cRoses are red/violets are blue/come here illegally/and we\u2019ll deport you.\u201d\n\nHappy Valentine's Day \u2665\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/6d7qmo7gtz \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 14, 2025\n\nMany, including some conservatives and immigration hawks, labeled these kinds of posts dehumanizing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stakes of each of these issues are quite different. But the goal is the same: to cause Trump\u2019s critics to pull their hair out \u2014 and maybe plant a seed.\n\nEven to the extent it actually is just some kind of joke or a provocation, those critics will regard things like bullying Canada, throwing up a straight-arm salute and talking about being a king as crass and beyond the pale.\n\nBut others will see something more insidious at work: a signal of intent and a dog-whistle to more-extreme supporters who might embrace such ideas. We\u2019ve seen over and over again how Trump will plant a seed in a seemingly joking or lighthearted way, only to fertilize it over and over again until it becomes a more serious proposal. Trump\u2019s allies will often downplay his provocations, only to see Trump actually do the thing they swore he wasn\u2019t serious about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephen Colbert summarized that view nicely: \u201cYou know he\u2019s trolling us, and we shouldn\u2019t take the bait. But with this guy, every troll is a trial balloon.\u201d\n\nConservatives, too, are invited to choose their own adventure. Those who might like these messages will celebrate them and be emboldened, while those who might find them objectionable will dismiss them as political gamesmanship and relish the common cause that is irritating the left.\n\nAs the National Review\u2019s Charles C.W. Cooke put it this week: \u201cEverything Trump says is 4D chess, you see. Unless you like it. If you like it, that\u2019s what he really thinks, and he\u2019s brave and correct for saying it. If you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s 4D chess and you need to relax.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has long exploited this dilemma between taking him seriously and taking him literally to great political effect, because it means he can say pretty much anything he wants and not lose support on his side. It\u2019s a social contract with the American people that skews decidedly in Trump\u2019s favor.",

All the characters go on a journey and yeah, it's very satisfactory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, when you read all the scripts, you realise that at the beginning, you were establishing the characters. Of course, Spencer was on a journey back home. But now you realise every character is on a journey of their own and not only a physical but a psychological journey. And these journeys are going to change these people forever,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Vampire Diaries star also talked about his character, saying he welcomed Father Renaud\u2019s upcoming changes \"wholeheartedly\" and called the experience \"a great adventure.\"\n\n\u201cAnd what I loved about my character is how complex my journey\u2014how transformational Father Renaud's journey is\u2014as he stumbles along in his quest to find this girl. What does she represent? It's a real transformational journey for him,\u201d Roche noted.\n\nFor the unversed, the first season of 1923 debuted on December 18, 2022, on Paramount+.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that the second season of 1923 is set to premiere on Sunday, February 23, 2025, on Paramount+.",

So I went to my eye doctor in the very first of October, and he did a real invasive, exclusive, whatever, eye exam, and told me that my spinal fluid was up, and he could tell that it was high based on my eyes.\u201d\n\nOptometrist Dr. Mark Bryant says he knew from first glance something was off.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s particular things that you look for in the eyes that will tip you off to things like that, and as I looked, I knew that it was not normal, and I knew from the symptoms that she had and everything that was going on, this was something that needed to be addressed very quickly.\u201d\n\nAfter her visit to her optometrist, Sapp says she was instructed to have an M.R.I. After the exam, she received unthinkable news.\n\n\u201cMy doctor is almost in tears,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he tells me, I don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but it\u2019s a brain tumor and I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 And so, I went, \u2018Excuse me?\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s a brain tumor, and it\u2019s shifted your brain like 5/8\u2014almost like a half an inch to the side.\u2019 He said, \u2018And it could cause you to have a stroke.\u2019\n\nSapp says she was then informed to be back at the hospital for surgery the following Friday.\n\n\u201cIt was a 12-hour surgery,\u201d she said. \u201cHad to be there at five in the morning. They told me before surgery I may have to have physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Thankfully, none of that. When I came out of surgery, they told me I called everybody by their nicknames, knew the Verizon password for them, so they kept me in the hospital until Monday, sent me home on medication.\u201d\n\nSnapp says without Dr. Bryant, she doesn\u2019t know where she would be.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t just decided, \u2018OK, this is something with my eyes, and I really need to have it looked at,\u2019 and he didn\u2019t brush it off as, \u2018No, you\u2019re fine,\u2019 he took the time to look at everything, took pictures\u2014which is not fun when your eyes are dilated\u2014but took pictures and everything and made sure to get me in with somebody to make sure that everything\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nDr. Bryant says Sapp\u2019s story should inspire more people to have yearly eye exams.\n\n\u201cEverything from glaucoma, cataracts\u2014which are operable\u2014but things like that can be hiding, and you really need to have those things checked out, and in Gayle\u2019s case, we found a tumor that potentially saved her life.\u201d\n\nGayle has now been tumor free for thirteen years.\n\nThe Georgia Optometric Association\u2019s board secretary, Dr. Stephen Summerow, honored her this week at a ceremony at Eyesight Associates in Macon.

            "content": "Saturday\u2019s Serie A action closes out at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza as title-bidding Inter take on mid-table Genoa in a must-win clash. Trailing pacesetters Napoli by two points, the hosts can\u2019t afford a mistake amid a rotten patch.\n\nFrancisco Conceicao\u2019s second-half strike condemned Inter to a frustrating 1-0 defeat in last weekend\u2019s Derby d\u2019Italia clash against bitter rivals Juventus. After only losing one of their first 22 Serie A outings (W15, D6), Simone Inzaghi\u2019s men have lost two of their last three, including a 3-0 demolition at Fiorentina a fortnight ago.\n\nWith high-profile contests against Lazio and Napoli in the Coppa Italia and Serie A, respectively, on the horizon, Inter must claim three points here to bolster their spirits ahead of a critical juncture. Anything less would likely compromise their chances of becoming the first Scudetto holders in five years to defend their title.\n\nVisiting Genoa could throw a spanner in the works as they head into proceedings in a buoyant mood after toppling relegation-threatened Venezia 2-0 on Monday. Andrea Pinamonti and Maxwel Cornet netted beyond the 80th minute at Stadio Luigi Ferraris to end Genoa\u2019s two-game winless league run (D1, L1).\n\nThat victory steered Patrick Vieira\u2019s side ten points away from the bottom three, putting Genoa only six points adrift of 10th-placed Udinese pre-round. Therefore, a first top-half finish in Serie A since 2014/15 has become a distinct possibility for the Griffins.\n\nMatch Preview\n\nInter\n\nKeen to enact revenge on Genoa for a dramatic 2-2 draw in August\u2019s reverse fixture at Luigi Ferraris, Inter can take confidence from a 2-1 win against Fiorentina in their last home league outing. That victory forms part of the home team\u2019s patchy seven-game form in Serie A (W3, D2, L2).\n\nHowever, Genoa\u2019s visit should be \u2018another day in the office\u2019 for Inter, especially considering their formidable head-to-head record since February 2018 (W8, D3). Furthermore, before a 2-1 win in this corresponding fixture last season, they had beaten this opposition \u2018to nil\u2019 in seven previous meetings at the San Siro.\n\nFour of those seven victories saw Inter score 4+ goals, a feat they\u2019ve achieved five times in the first 25 Serie A rounds, most recently in a 4-0 rout of Lecce in late January. Moreover, they\u2019ve been outstanding at home, winning eight of their ten previous matches across all competitions (D1, L1), including the last three on the spin.\n\nGenoa\n\nAfter leaving it late to beat Venezia, Genoa could post back-to-back league triumphs for the first time this season. They last achieved that milestone in January 2024, highlighting the team\u2019s remarkable inconsistency.\n\nThat win against Eusebio Di Francesco\u2019s side was a rare occasion to see Genoa score 2+ goals in Serie A action this season. Indeed, Vieira\u2019s charges have averaged under a goal per game, suggesting Inter\u2019s backline could have a field day.\n\nGenoa encouragingly scored once on their last three league travels despite failing to win each (D1, L2). Particularly dominant after the halftime interval, the visitors have tallied 12 second-half \u2018wins\u2019 this term, with only two teams bettering that haul pre-round.\n\nTeam News\n\nFirst-choice Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer underwent toe surgery and will be on the sidelines, meaning Josep Martinez is in line for his Serie A debut in the Nerazzurri shirt. With Marcus Thuram yet to regain full fitness, Inzaghi may turn to Joaquin Correa to partner up with Lautaro Martinez.\n\nOn the other hand, Genoa will take this trip without captain Milan Badelj and versatile forward Vitinha. Honest Ahanor and Morten Thorsby are also on the sidelines as Cornet bids for promotion off the bench after netting his first Serie A goal earlier this week.\n\nInter vs Genoa Potential Starting Line-ups\n\nInter (3-5-2): J. Martinez; Pavard, De Vrij, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Zielinski, Dimarco; Correa, L. Martinez.\n\nGenoa (4-2-3-1): Leali; De Winter, Bani, Vasquez, Martin; Frendrup, Masini; Cornet, Messias, Miretti; Pinamonti.\n\nInter vs Genoa Prediction\n\nOnly victory will settle fans\u2019 nerves after Inter won one of their last four Serie A games. Given their long-standing dominance in this fixture, it\u2019s hard to expect anything else, but the visitors have proved capable of causing upsets.\n\nVieira inspired Genoa to a 0-0 draw against Milan on this ground in mid-December. Yet, replicating that feat could be beyond them against the division\u2019s best team.\n\nPrediction: Inter to Win",

Photo courtesy of the Alabama Department of Archives & History. Donated by Alabama Media Group. Photo by Jerry Ayres, Birmingham News.\n\nA.G. Gaston ranks high among modern Alabama\u2019s most successful businessmen.\n\nBorn in the late 19th century, he overcame poverty and racial discrimination during his long climb to success in Birmingham, where he lived after 1905. Gaston\u2019s $40 million business empire spread over the fields of finance, construction, hospitality, communication, education and insurance.\n\nFor a short time in 1940s Birmingham, he presided over a small bottling company, owned and operated by African Americans. In those few up-and-down years, the entrepreneur learned important, hard lessons in the soft drink business.\n\nGaston had pursued a bottling business for several years. Having seen the successes of African American bottlers in other cities, he felt Birmingham could sustain such a venture.\n\n\u201cEven when allowances were made for maximum overhead expenses,\u201d Gaston wrote in his memoir, \u201cit appeared to me that the profits were enormous and fast.\u201d\n\n- Sponsor -\n\nHe secured franchise and trademark rights to make and distribute Brown Belle, a line of soft drinks marketed to Black clientele.\n\nThe company organized in November 1940 with Gaston as head. Early associates included Robert L. Williams, who was proprietor of the popular Little Savoy Caf\u00e9; steakhouse owner Alvey Alexander; event promoter B. F. Cammack; and attorney Arthur D. Shores. A. G. Gaston Jr., the business titan\u2019s namesake, served as manager of the company\u2019s 15 employees.\n\nNone of the individuals involved with Brown Belle\u2019s launch had prior experience in the bottling or distribution business. What they had in abundance, however, was well-founded confidence in A. G. Gaston himself.\n\nGaston also had a silent partner: James Lee Sr., chief executive of Buffalo Rock, the Magic City\u2019s bottling behemoth. Quietly, Lee installed bottling equipment at Gaston\u2019s 4th Avenue facility in exchange for a profit share. It was a risky endeavor, considering the rigid color line of the era. Neither of the businessmen spoke publicly of their arrangement, which only came to light in 2010.\n\nWhen it launched in January 1940, the Brown Belle Bottling Co. produced several varieties, including Brown Belle Boogie, ginger ale and \u201ctrue fruit flavors\u201d like grape, lemon, orange, peach and strawberry.\n\nWith an eye toward community uplift, the company donated a percentage of its profits to local charities. \u201cEvery time you drink a bottle of Brown Belle you will satisfy your thirst, tickle your palate and ease your conscience,\u201d read an advertisement. After the U.S. entered World War II, Brown Belle contributed to area war bond drives.\n\nDemand was high. More than 1 million bottles were sold in the first 10 months. Profits for the first year were a reported $100,000 (about $2.3 million today.) By 1943, more than 4 million bottles had been sold. The company outgrew its location and moved to a renovated two-story brick building on the corner of 3rd Avenue and 14th Street. Brown Belle also secured a retail establishment, winning a bid to build and operate a concession stand at Tuxedo Park, a municipal entertainment venue for African Americans.\n\nIn October 1946, Gaston traveled to Washington, D.C., to address the annual Conference on the Negro in Business. He urged the young attendees to \u201cgo into a new business, not the regular, run-of-the-mill business.\u201d\n\nThere was reason to heed his words. In just six years, his startup soft drink gamble had sold 10 million bottles and weathered public challenges. Earlier in the year, Arthur Shores, noted Birmingham attorney and an original Brown Belle officer, fended off a trademark dispute against Gaston in federal court.\n\nA newspaper ad touted the millions of Brown Belle bottles manufactured.\n\nDespite the confidence espoused by its founder, problems bubbled just below the surface. Burglars stole a safe from the Brown Belle headquarters containing $500 and important business records. It was a blow, to be sure, but not a fatal one. Employee maleficence was a greater, more costly malady. Gaston discovered some of his staff were involved in schemes to offload the company\u2019s sugar and syrup to bootleggers.\n\nBrown Belle also experienced increased industry competition after World War II, including one challenge from another, albeit unlikely, Alabamian: heavyweight boxing champ Joe Louis. New York\u2019s William P. Graham, president of the All-American Drinks Corp., partnered with the Chambers County native to market the eponymous soft drink called Joe Louis Punch. The boxer\u2019s name alone helped secure dozens of franchise opportunities throughout the country. But when Graham came calling for a partnership with Brown Belle, Gaston refused him, perhaps still leery from his recent trademark dispute. By 1947, the upstart Joe Louis Bottling Co. of Birmingham was selling crates of the new soda, \u201cthe bottle of the century,\u201d from its own headquarters on North 26th Street, a few blocks away from Brown Belle.\n\nIt is unlikely that Joe Louis knew anything of the dispute. Throughout the short-lived enterprise, he showed little interest in the product that bore his name. Once, when asked by a radio host to name his favorite beverage, the champ quickly replied \u201cCoca-Cola!\u201d\n\nStill, rising pressures and fizzling profits left Gaston, in his own words, \u201cexhausted, embarrassed and no little ashamed.\u201d\n\nHe candidly concluded that he had entered the business for the wrong reasons. \u201cI turned\u2026to the idea of filling my pockets\u2026. After all the accounts were in, I found that I had lost about $60,000 trying to get rich quick.\u201d\n\nGaston absorbed the company\u2019s debts himself to save face with the community and his investors. In his memoir, he called the venture a \u201ccomplete fiasco.\u201d In this fact, Gaston and his biographers agree. The Brown Belle Bottling Co. was one of his only true business failures. Before it, and after, were years of successes.\n\n\u201cFailure is not fatal,\u201d Winston Churchill once said. \u201cIt is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d\n\nWhen he shuttered Brown Belle, Gaston\u2019s greatest years as a businessman and engaged citizen were ahead of him, including his crucial support of the Civil Rights Movement and the fostering of minority-owned businesses. In these efforts he continued well into advanced years, before his death in 1996 at the age of 103. Thus, for a half-century after Brown Belle, Gaston had the chance, and the courage, to continue.\n\nHistorian Scotty E. Kirkland is a freelance contributor to Business Alabama.

The big story of \u200bthe 2024 \u200belection was the movement of the heart of Big Capital, most prominently Big Tech, into Trump\u2019s camp. UPS\u2019s scrubbing of January 6 is a belated but important bending at the knee of President Donald Trump.\n\nHis rapid expansion of presidential power, union-busting, and rollback of every major legislative victory of the working class and oppressed peoples in this country during the last century is going to be a huge boon to UPS, whatever tensions exist over international trade agreements. Back in October 2022, I summarized the lucrative relationship between UPS and the first Trump administration:\n\n\u201cThe Trump years were good ones for UPS\u2019s corporate leaders. While the company was cool toward former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, it moved quickly to reconcile with him after his election. UPS contributed heavily to Trump\u2019s 2016 inauguration fund. UPS Executive Chairman David Abney was treated to a state dinner at the Trump White House, while CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 later hosted Trump at UPS\u2019s facility at Atlanta\u2019s International Airport. UPS was central to Trump administration initiatives in the early months of the pandemic, including Project Airbridge and Operation Warp Speed. However, relations became strained with Trump following the 2020 presidential election. Tom\u00e9 denounced the attack on the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021. \u201cWe are appalled by the lawlessness and violence that unfolded at the U.S. Capitol and strongly condemn the actions of those individuals who participated in the illegal activities that destroyed property and cost lives,\u201d she wrote. Tom\u00e9, however, failed to mention Trump by name.\n\nScreenshot of UPS\u2019s original statement.\n\nAlong with other major corporations, UPS threatened to suspend campaign contributions to U.S. House and Senate Republicans, who voted against the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president, known as the Sedition caucus. Within a few months UPS and other major corporations and corporate lobbying groups changed their minds. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) reported:\n\n\u2018Corporate and industry group political action committees have donated more than $44 million directly to the campaigns and leadership PACs of the 147 members of the Sedition Caucus. Companies and trade associations that pledged to suspend donations have given more than $12 million to the campaign and leadership PACs of the Sedition Caucus. Koch Industries ($626,500), American Crystal Sugar ($530,000), Home Depot ($525,000), Boeing ($488,000), and UPS ($479,500) have contributed the most money to members of the Sedition Caucus through their corporate PACs.\u2019 Tom\u00e9\u2019s reconciliation with representatives who legitimized Trump\u2019s attempted presidential coup \u2014 and who may control Congress after the November midterm elections \u2014 shouldn\u2019t surprise us. Trump lavished huge gifts on UPS and Corporate America that have made them richer.\u201d\n\nThe second Trump presidency has the potential to be even more lucrative for UPS, given that the bulk of UPS\u2019s unionized workers are Teamsters and led by prominent Trump ally Sean O\u2019Brien. This situation cannot hold. UPS Teamsters are literally caught between a rock and a hard place, a situation that could lead to unrest and demands for change from the rank and file.",

It wasn't so much the numbers from the final quarter of 2024 as it was management outlining the strategic changes it was making to its business. The market didn't like the update much, sending the stock sharply lower. At the time of writing, it's down 9.4% in 2025.\n\nStill, the changes align with management's philosophy, and there's a robust case for arguing that the stock is an excellent value right now. Here's the lowdown.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nUPS delivers change\n\nLet's start by looking at the changes announced by UPS. CEO Carol Tome said the changes were necessary, as UPS could \"lose momentum\" in the U.S. unless it addressed three specific challenges:\n\nA slowing U.S. small package delivery market with \"changing package characteristics\" -- indeed, UPS management overestimated demand in the U.S. small package market for the last two years\n\nAn over-reliance on its largest customer, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- Amazon was responsible for 11.8% of total company revenue in 2024\n\nA reliance on the United States Postal Service (USPS) for its UPS SurePost (lower cost, less urgent deliveries)\n\nManagement decided to take pre-emptive action over these \"challenges\" in two ways. First, it agreed with Amazon to gradually lower its delivery volumes until it had 50% of its current volume by the second half of 2026. As noted above, Amazon is a major customer, and this implies a significant reduction in volume and revenue from the e-commerce company.\n\nSecond, UPS will bring the SurePost deliveries currently undertaken by the USPS in-house.\n\nThese changes can immediately be seen in the full-year 2025 guidance, whereby management expects lower revenue (fewer Amazon deliveries) but higher overall operating margin and higher operating margin in the U.S. domestic package segment. Consequently, management expects adjusted operating profit to improve as it enacts the strategic change of adjusting its network away from lower-margin Amazon deliveries and reaps the benefit of a positive shift in margin.\n\nUPS Guidance 2024 2025 (Est) Revenue $91.1 billion $89 billion Non-GAAP adjusted operating profit margin 9.8% 10.8% Implied non-GAAP adjusted operating margin* $8.9 billion ~$9.6 billion*\n\nData source: UPS presentations. GAAP = generally accepted accounting practices. *Author's calculation.\n\nRisks ahead for UPS\n\nIn theory, at least, the plan makes sense, but the market sold the stock off on the news, and many Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets on it. The reasoning behind both moves most likely comes from skepticism over the execution of UPS' plans to simultaneously lower Amazon delivery volumes and lower costs in its network. CFO Brian Dykes promised more color on the issue on the first-quarter earnings call in a few months, but investors have reason to be cautious, given UPS' execution over the last couple of years.\n\nWorker delivering package to house.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy UPS is well-placed\n\nThat said, most of UPS' problems in recent years have come from a combination of lower-than-expected U.S. small package delivery volume and a protracted and costly labor dispute in 2023.\n\nMoreover, there are clear indications that UPS is improving its underlying business. Its three-year transformational plans outlined on its Investor Day last year involve continued focus on expanding deliveries in targeted areas like small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and healthcare, while investing in productivity-enhancing IT (automation and smart facilities) to enable asset consolidation.\n\nThe early results have been encouraging. SMB volume as a share of U.S. volume rose to 28.9% in 2024 from 28.6% in 2023, driven by a 17% increase in its digital access program. Management expects an increase to 32% in 2025. Healthcare-related volume grew by 5% to $10.5 billion in 2024 and aims to reach $20 billion by 2026. Furthermore, the IT investments resulted in the closure of 11 buildings, and management continues to invest in smart and automated facilities.\n\nFurthermore, as previously discussed, one of the key metrics to follow with UPS is the spread between its revenue per piece (RPP) and its cost per piece (CPP) in its U.S. domestic package segment. For the second quarter running, UPS reported a favorable result.\n\nUPS U.S. Domestic Package Segment First Quarter 2024 Second Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2024 Fourth Quarter 2024 Revenue per piece (0.3)% (2.6)% (2.2)% 2.4% Adjusted cost per piece 4.1% 2.5% (4.1)% 0.9% Spread (4.4 pp) (5.1 pp) 1.9 pp 1.5 pp\n\nData source: UPS presentations. Pp = percentage points.\n\nWhat it means to UPS investors\n\nFocusing on higher-margin deliveries rather than chasing delivery volume lies at the heart of UPS' \"better not bigger\" approach, and the plan to reduce lower-margin Amazon delivery volumes makes perfect sense. Meanwhile, UPS is demonstrating underlying progress in its strategic objectives (SMBs, healthcare, \"network of the future\") and growing the RPP/CPP spread, which shows confidence that it can hit its targets.\n\nTwo people counting cash.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile there's no guarantee that UPS will successfully finesse a lowering of Amazon volumes and cut costs smoothly in the process, the trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1 times earnings and a dividend yield of 4.9% gives a good margin of safety, and the stock looks like an excellent value prospect.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and United Parcel Service wasn\u2019t one of them.

The UPS is plugged directly into a power outlet, and any connected devices are plugged into the UPS.\n\nBut the innovation is not without its challenges. For instance, \u201cmost UPSs are black boxes, so users don\u2019t know how long the battery will last or if the incoming power quality is consistent.\u201d\n\nRemote locations are another challenge. \u201cConsider a company with 5,000 retail locations across the United States,\u201d Giri says. \u201cEach one has a point-of-sale device connected to a UPS.

UPS said the ideal weight for SurePost packages is less than 10 pounds.\n\nBefore the contract expiration, SurePost packages could be delivered by UPS or USPS to the 48 US states, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, all U.S. Territories, PO Boxes and Military APO/FPO Destinations, Supply Chain Dive reported. The transit time for these deliveries was an estimated two to seven days within the U.S., and longer for other destinations.\n\nA United States Postal Service logo is displayed on a U.S. Post Office mailbox on April 1, 2024 in Montclair, California.\n\nWhat did USPS say about the contract's expiration?\n\nIn a statement emailed to USA TODAY, USPS spokesperson Felicia Lott said, \"Throughout the past year, the Postal Service has been implementing a new strategic approach with respect to its contracts with package consolidator companies - ones that consolidate large package volumes at local delivery units and use our Parcel Select offering \u2014 including negotiating new agreements.\"\n\n\"Prior agreements failed to reflect operational and financial realities, the evolving postal network, or the enhancements to our portfolio of product offerings,\" Lott said. \"As a result of our new approach, some businesses negotiated new agreements with us, and some have not. We concluded our negotiations in December 2024. Our Parcel Select product still exists and any business can use it now at our published rates.\"\n\nUSPS had a contract with FedEx for domestic air transportation services, but it expired on Sept. 29, 2024. The government agency later chose UPS for its new air cargo contract.\n\n\"FedEx and the United States Postal Service have had a long and productive relationship for more than 20 years,\" FedEx said in a statement in March. \"Over time, our respective strategies have shifted as we transform our networks and operations for the future.\"\n\nThis story was updated to add a video and statement from USPS.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: UPS, USPS package delivery changes: Here's what to know",

            "content": "A 6-year-old girl who was severely injured by dogs in January is recovering, her mother said this week.\n\nBut while their family\u2019s life is starting to get back into a routine, Casey Winter said, it can still be a struggle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of doing our best with what we\u2019ve got. We\u2019re trying to stay positive through it all,\u201d said Winter, a Minnesota resident\n\nWinter said her daughter Zophiana Vera-Winter has started getting back to regular activities like going to school. Zophiana underwent surgeries for injuries to her arm, legs and ear after being bitten by three dogs on Jan. 25.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of how well she\u2019s doing,\u201d Winter said. At the same time, the family were still going through \u201cups and downs,\u201d she said.\n\nLast week, misdemeanor charges were filed in Lyon County District Court against 44-year-old Katrina Marie Davis, the owner of the dogs that attacked Zophiana. Court documents said the city of Minneota took custody of two of the dogs, to move forward with an order to destroy them. The two dogs had previously been declared dangerous by the city of Minneota.\n\nA third dog, which was declared dangerous by the city of Ghent, was still in custody at the kennel, said Lyon County Sheriff Eric Wallen.\n\nWinter said Zophiana and her sister Vi\u2019Vienne were in the care of a babysitter at the time of the dog attack. The woman watching the two girls wasn\u2019t Winter\u2019s usual babysitter, she said.\n\nThe dog attack happened at a Ghent residence where Davis lived.\n\nWinter said Zophiana\u2019s injuries weren\u2019t the only outcome of the dog attack. There\u2019s been an emotional toll too.\n\n\u201cMy daughter who saw it, she struggles a lot with it. I struggle with it a lot,\u201d Winter said.\n\nWinter said that, as she returns to work, \u201cI really struggle with them going to a babysitter.\u201d\n\nAfter the dog attack, Winter said she cut contact with the babysitter who was watching the girls.\n\nAnother thing that was hard about the dog attack was that Zophiana liked dogs, and some of their friends and family members have dogs, Winter said.\n\n\u201cWe have had the conversation about how not all dogs are good,\u201d she said.\n\nWinter said her family was looking into resources to help them with moving forward. She said they were also waiting to see whether Zophiana might need future surgery to help with scarring.\n\nLast week, misdemeanor charges of substantial bodily harm caused by a dog were filed against Davis in Lyon County District Court. A hearing in the case is scheduled for March 5.\n\nA criminal complaint alleges that Davis\u2019 three pit bulls attacked a child and caused multiple bite injuries. The attack took place at a residence in Ghent where Davis was living.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Winter said of criminal charges being filed after the attack. \u201cThere\u2019s not really much that can make up for this, but I feel like somebody should be held accountable.\u201d\n\nDavis has two past misdemeanor convictions for dogs running at large, according to Lyon County District Court records. Those complaints were filed in 2021 and 2022. In one of those incidents, two of Davis\u2019 dogs injured another dog in Minneota, causing more than $700 in veterinary bills, court records said. In a civil suit filed in 2022, a Lyon County District Court judge gave law enforcement the authority to enforce an order to destroy the two dogs, court documents said.\n\nLyon County court records showed there are currently two other open court cases involving Davis. Last year, she was charged with making threats of violence and disorderly conduct for allegedly threatening the Lyon County administrator. A pre-trial hearing date in that case is set for March 28. The other ongoing case involving Davis is a petition for civil commitment due to mental illness.\n\nIn the criminal complaint for the dog attack, Davis was described as not making sense when speaking to a Lyon County deputy. The complaint alleged she told law enforcement the injured child was \u201cfake.\u201d",

Will mail be delivered?\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Presidents Day: what businesses are open and closed on the holiday Washington's birthday, or Presidents Day, is the third Monday of February, so here are what businesses are open and closed on the federal holiday? USA TODAY\n\nMonday, Feb. 17 is Presidents Day, a federal holiday to observe the birthdays of former presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhile the holiday is sometimes misunderstood as a celebration of the lives and birthdays of all U.S. presidents, the holiday was initially called Washington's Birthday. It was the first federal holiday to honor an individual's birth date.\n\nWashington's birthday, Feb. 22, was designated by Congress as a holiday for all federal workers in 1885. In 1971, the Uniform Monday Holiday Law changed the date to the third Monday in February, according to the National Archives. It adds that the position of the holiday between the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln, whose birthday is Feb. 12, gave rise to the popular name of Presidents Day.\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2025? Here's everything to know including what is open and closed\n\nWhile most restaurants, grocery stores, and retail stores will remain open on Feb. 17, that will not happen for banks, post offices, and the stock market.

Additionally, Mindy Kaling, the series\u2019 creator and executive producer, has renewed her big overall deal with Warner Bros. TV Group, Deadline can reveal exclusively.\n\nThe project, fka Murray Hill, was taken out at the start of 2024, garnering interest from multiple buyers before landing at Hulu after a bidding with a script-to-series commitment. Kaling\u2019s frequent collaborator Charlie Grandy (Velma) serves as executive producer and showrunner.\n\nWBTV signed Kaling and her Kaling International banner six years ago in a very competitive situation as she left her longtime NBCUniversal home. While terms were not revealed back then, Deadline reported at the time that the WBTVG deal was for six years and worth about $8.5 million a year.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAs studios do with their top talent whom they want to keep, WBTVG approached Kaling about a renewal months before her current pact was to expire in May 2025, reaching an agreement on a multi-year renewal last month, sources said.\n\nWhile the marketplace is nowhere near the overall deal bubble of 2019 that saw prices skyrocket, studios continue to put a premium on writer-producers like Kaling who have proven that they can originate and shepherd multiple series at the same time. Going forward, she will continue to develop and produce series exclusively for WBTV.\n\nSince moving to the Warner Bros Discovery-owned studio, Kaling has co-created/executive produced several comedy series, The Sex Lives Of College Girls on Max; Running Point, starring Kate Hudson, which premieres on Netflix next week; and Not Suitable For Work. She also executive produced the studio\u2019s animated comedy series for Max Velma and is executive producing multi-camera comedy Zarna, which landed a rare these days pilot order at CBS.\n\nNot Suitable For Work explores the next stage in young people\u2019s lives after high school, which Kaling chronicled in her hit Netflix/Universal TV comedy Never Have I Ever, and college, the setting of The Sex Lives of College Girls. It centers around five work-obsessed twenty-somethings striving for professional success and, if they have time, personal happiness in Manhattan\u2019s most glamorous neighborhood, Murray Hill.\n\nKaling and Grandy, who also is under an overall deal at WBTV, executive produce with Howard Klein of 3 Arts Entertainment.\n\nThis marks Kaling\u2019s third series for Hulu following The Mindy Project, which relocated to the streamer after three seasons on Fox, and the romantic comedy series Four Weddings and Funeral. Kaling, who today is getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is repped by CAA, 3 Arts and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.\n\nNot Suitable For Work joins Hulu Originals\u2019 roster of live-action comedies that includes one returning series, Only Murders In The Building, as well as two upcoming ones, Glen Powell\u2019s Chad Powers amd multi-camera sitcom Mid-Century Modern.",

(Photo: UPS)\n\nUPS has introduced an atypical air cargo route focused on reverse trade from Paris to Hong Kong to support exporters in France.\n\nThe primary flow of goods by air and ocean tends to be from Asia to Europe because that is where low-cost manufacturing centers and a large consumer market are located. Backhaul routes tend to carry less cargo.\n\nThe integrated express delivery and logistics company informed select news outlets that it is operating a Boeing 747-8 freighter five times per week from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Hong Kong to meet growing export demand from French businesses. Primary customers include makers of wine, perishable foods, luxury goods, medical products and aerospace components\n\nThe new service makes economic sense because Hong Kong has large consumer bases for high fashion, food and drinks, as well as growing sectors for contract manufacturing of dental and pharmaceutical products, UPS (NYSE: UPS) said.\n\nFrance is the largest exporter of wine and other food products to Hong Kong and Asia, accounting for over 20% of its total export market. Hong Kong\u2019s luxury fashion market has recovered from the pandemic and is projected to grow 4.9% in the next five years, reaching sales of $2.9 billion in 2029, according to Euromonitor. Hong Kong has the highest per-capita spending on luxury goods in the world.\n\n\u201cWith this new flight path, we can provide French businesses of all sizes and industries the fast and reliable service they need to grow and stay competitive. Shipping preferences play an increasing part in a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. Thanks to our investments we can make logistics a competitive advantage, offering unmatched choice, convenience, and control,\u201d said Michiel van Veen, a manager for Benelux and France, in a prepared statement.\n\nIt is more common for airlines to provide scheduled service from Asia to Europe, sometimes as a round trip with less backhaul volume or with aircraft deployed to other destinations before returning to origin.\n\nAn Asian logistics company recently chartered freighter aircraft to ship Chinese goods from Ezhou International Airport in China to Paris via Abu Dhabi, with Etihad Airways flying the second leg with Boeing 777s. Etihad\u2019s cargo division also began operating a weekly cargo service for DB Schenker from Ezhou to Frankfurt, Germany, carrying e-commerce packages, electronics, industrial goods, retail merchandise and automotive parts.\n\nOther recent UPS enhancements in France include the introduction of surcharge-free Saturday delivery and the addition of 100 Iveco eDaily vans to the delivery fleet.",

            "content": "UPS (NYSE: UPS) has a fascinating value proposition. Based on management's guidance, the stock is an excellent value, but can UPS meet its leadership's expectations?\n\nWhile that question won't be answered in full until at least the second half of 2026, the good news is that investors can use a host of data to monitor events and judge whether the stock is worth investing in.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nThe value proposition at UPS\n\nAs noted, based on the company's guidance, UPS is a great value. Management's guidance for 2025 calls for revenue of $89 billion with an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.8% compared to 9.8% in 2024, implying an 8% improvement in adjusted operating profit in 2025. In addition, management expects $5.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF).\n\nBased on Wall Street estimates and management's guidance, UPS currently trades at 14 times 2025 earnings, and 16.6 times 2025 FCF.\n\nThese are attractive multiples in themselves, and even more so for a company that could end 2025 with strong momentum in expanding profit margins and having successfully strategically readjusted its business for growth.\n\nUPS restructures\n\nIt's one thing to see a company at an attractive valuation, and it's another thing to believe in the numbers that make the valuation. In UPS's case, there's a dose of skepticism about its ability to meet its guidance due to the complexity of the changes ahead.\n\nIn a nutshell, UPS has agreed with its largest customer, Amazon (responsible for 11.8% of total company revenue in 2024), to reduce its Amazon deliveries by 50% by the second half of 2026. Also, UPS is bringing SurePost deliveries in-house and away from the United States Postal Service (USPS).\n\nPackage deliveries.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Amazon move makes perfect sense on paper, and it's not without precedent -- FedEx has also reduced its Amazon deliveries. The reasoning behind FedEx's previous move and UPS's current move is the same: reduce lower-margin Amazon deliveries and improve margins in the process.\n\nWith the reduction in Amazon volumes negatively impacting revenue but positively impacting margins, Wall Street sees UPS revenue in 2026 comparable to the $91.1 billion in 2024, but with earnings per share up from $7.72 in 2024 to $8.89 in 2026.\n\nUPS faces challenges\n\nHowever, getting to the numbers won't be a walk in the park. UPS will need to reconfigure its network significantly. In the words of CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 on the recent earnings call, UPS will launch \"multiyear initiatives we're calling Efficiency Reimagined, which tackle our processes from end to end, from peak hiring practices to processing payments and more. Efficiency Reimagined should drive approximately $1 billion in savings.\"\n\nCFO Brian Dykes acknowledged that UPS would have to \"bring the fixed asset base, the buildings, the vehicles, the aircraft, in line with the new volume levels.\" Given the scale of UPS's Amazon-based deliveries, it's clear that UPS has a challenge ahead, not least at a time when the U.S. small package market remains in low growth mode.\n\nA family with packages.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMonitoring progress at UPS\n\nUltimately, we won't know whether UPS will succeed until 2026. Still, investors can monitor progress, and the key number to follow is the progression of its U.S. domestic segment margin because it's the segment where the changes are due to be enacted. UPS expects its U.S. domestic package segment adjusted operating margin to expand from 7.5% in 2024 to 8.8% in 2025, and then to hit 12% by the end of 2026.\n\nAn investor looking at a laptop.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's a dramatic improvement and fits into UPS's \"better, not bigger\" framework. Combined with an ongoing focus on growing deliveries in targeted markets like healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), UPS aims to focus on its most profitable deliveries.\n\nIs UPS a buy?\n\nDykes told investors to expect growth in its U.S. domestic operating margin in every quarter through 2025, which will then accelerate in 2026 -- he promised to lay out details on the next earnings call.\n\nAs such, if you want to invest in UPS, you should monitor its progress on this metric. If UPS hits its targets, the stock is likely to appreciate substantially.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and United Parcel Service wasn\u2019t one of them.

USA TODAY\n\nMonday, Feb. 17 is Presidents Day, a federal holiday to observe the birthdays of former presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhile the holiday is sometimes misunderstood as a celebration of the lives and birthdays of all U.S. presidents, the holiday was originally called Washington's Birthday and was the first federal holiday to honor an individual's birth date.\n\nWashington's birthday, Feb. 22, was designated by Congress as a holiday for all federal workers in 1885, and in 1971, the Uniform Monday Holiday Law changed the date to the third Monday in February, according to the National Archives. It adds that the position of the holiday between the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln, whose birthday is Feb. 12, gave rise to the popular name of Presidents Day.\n\nWhile most restaurants, grocery stores, and retail stores will remain open on Feb. 17, that will not be the case for banks, post offices, and the stock market.\n\nHere's what will be open and closed on Presidents Day in 2025.\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2025?\n\nPresidents Day will be observed on Monday, Feb. 17 this year.\n\nIs the post office open on Presidents Day?

The USPS will resume regular operations on Tuesday, Feb. 18.\n\nAre banks open on Presidents Day?\n\nBecause Presidents Day is a federal holiday, branches of Capital One, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC, Chase, Truist and CitiBank, among others, will be closed on Monday, Feb. 17.\n\nAre shipping services, like UPS and FedEx, open on Presidents Day?\n\nUPS pickup and delivery services are available on Feb. 17, and UPS Store locations will be open, according to the company's website.\n\nUPS SurePost and UPS Mail Innovations deliveries will require one day additional business days' time in transit due to the U.S. Postal Service being closed on the day.\n\nMost FedEx pickup and delivery services will also be available on the day, and FedEx Office locations will be open as well, according to the company's website.\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

            "content": "Though value outperformed growth in the third quarter of 2024, recent market trends have overwhelmingly favored growth and technology stocks, leading to a decline in the representation of value stocks within US large-cap indexes. As of September 30, 2024, growth stocks comprised 32% of the Russell index, whereas value stocks accounted for only 8%, resulting in a notable 24% gap. This stands in contrast to the past 25 years, during which the average difference in market weight between growth and value stocks within the index was 7.4%.\n\nThe report further mentioned that several factors may have influenced this shift toward value stocks. Strong job growth, declining inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to begin cutting interest rates have boosted investor confidence, allowing the rally to extend beyond the largest mega-cap stocks. In addition, value-driven sectors that are sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014tend to benefit from a lower rate environment.\n\nThe Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been largely driven by a small group of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies account for over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, in recent months, market leadership has shifted, with value-oriented stocks gaining momentum. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index climbed 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% gain of the Russell Growth Index, as reported by BlackRock.\n\nOne of the reasons these investment strategies remain effective is their long history of delivering strong returns. Approaches centered on identifying undervalued stocks or prioritizing dividend-paying companies have consistently produced favorable results over time. Heartland Advisors referenced a study analyzing US stock returns from 1802 to 2002, which found that dividends and their growth contributed 5.8% to the total annualized return of 7.9% over the 200-year period. Similarly, research from the London Business School examined global returns from 1900 to 2005. The study found that across 17 countries, the average real return was approximately 5%, with an average dividend yield of 4.5% during that timeframe. These findings reinforce the appeal of long-term investment strategies focused on value and income generation.\n\nA low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio indicates that a stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings, presenting a potential buying opportunity for investors looking to acquire shares at a reasonable price. Stocks that combine low P/E ratios with high dividend yields tend to attract those seeking both value and steady income.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) stands against other low PE high dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis shift has inadvertently left many portfolios lacking diversification and underexposed to value stocks, potentially causing investors to miss out on gains as value stocks recover. To address this imbalance, investors may benefit from deliberately increasing their allocation to value stocks by complementing core US equity index funds with a dedicated value-focused investment strategy.\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed recently, largely due to the market\u2019s strong focus on AI-related stocks. As a result, their valuations have declined in recent months. When it comes to dividend investing, high yields often create uncertainty among investors, making it challenging to determine whether these stocks are worthwhile investments. Investors often gravitate toward stocks with high dividend yields, assuming that a higher yield automatically translates to better returns. However, a study by Wellington Management challenged this assumption, revealing that while stocks with the highest dividend payouts and yields performed well over time, they did not necessarily outperform those with moderately high, yet not extreme, dividend yields. This finding suggests that excessively high yields do not always lead to the best results, emphasizing the need for a more balanced approach rather than focusing solely on yield size. Analysts generally consider dividend yields in the range of 3% to 6% to be healthy.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this list, we filtered for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio below 15 and dividend yields exceeding 5% as of February 16. From that group, we chose companies with a proven track record of consistently paying dividends to their shareholders. The ranking of these stocks is based on their forward P/E ratios, arranged from the highest to the lowest.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(UPS) Low PE High Dividend Stock to Buy Now?\n\nA warehouse filled with boxes of parcels, symbolizing the companies reliable logistics services.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 14.71\n\nDividend Yield as of February 16: 5.64%\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is a Georgia-based shipping and supply chain management company that offers various related services to its consumers. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported $25.3 billion in revenue, which saw a 1.54% growth from the same period last year. It has also reached a preliminary agreement with its largest customer to reduce volume by over 50% by the second half of 2026. In addition, starting January 1, 2025, it will take full control of its UPS SurePost product. To adapt to these changes, the company is restructuring its U.S. network and launching multi-year \u201cefficiency reimagined\u201d initiatives, with the goal of saving approximately $1.0 billion through a comprehensive process overhaul.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is prioritizing the expansion of its healthcare logistics services as part of its strategy to establish itself as a global leader in the sector. In January 2025, the company strengthened its capabilities by acquiring Frigo-Trans and its subsidiary BPL, further enhancing its ability to offer comprehensive temperature-controlled logistics solutions, especially in Europe.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.64 per share, having raised it by 0.6% in February. This marked the company\u2019s 23rd consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes UPS one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock supports a dividend yield of 5.64%, as of February 16. In addition to its dividend growth, the company is a preferred choice for income investors because of its strong cash position. In fiscal year 2024, the company reported $10.1 billion in operating cash flow, while free cash flow amounted to $6.3 billion. It also returned $5.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nOverall, UPS ranks 10th on our list of low PE high dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for UPS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UPS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This episode was hosted by Kim Shine & Joel Dresang, edited by Sam Wood and includes three stories based on the theme of \u201cBreak Ups\u201d from Craig Wiroll, Tony Anderson and Kennita Hickman.\n\nEpisode transcript below from Ex Fabula's Real Storie MKE series.\n\nKim Shine:Welcome to Real Stories MKE, brought to you by Ex Fabula, as part of its mission to connect Milwaukee through real stories. I'm Kim Shine.\n\nJoel Dresang: And I\u2019m Joel Dresang. Ex Fabula believes that everyone has personal stories worth sharing. Ex Fabula conducts storytelling workshops for community members to build their storytelling skills and confidence, and Ex Fabula hosts StorySlams where folks share their true stories on stage. Today, we're bringing you three of those heartbreaking stories.\n\nKim Shine: And maybe they're heartbreaking, but maybe they're not. This season of Real Stories MKE is presented by Christine Symchych and Jim McNulty. Thank you guys. The theme for this episode is \u201cBreak Ups.\u201d So when you usually consider a separation, our minds might go to a more negative or sad place. But because life happens, a breakup can actually be an awakening in our stories. This time, fresh starts are more of the vibe here. Lessons learned, experience had, and new paths ahead.\n\nJoel Dresang: So, Kim, when you came up with the idea for breakups....\n\nKim Shine: Yeah!\n\nJoel Dresang: For an episode. Ever since then I've had this song in my head. It's Gladys Knight and the Pips singing. \u2018Neither one of us wants to be the first to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nKim Shine: Okay. Yeah, I think it goes [singing] \u201cNeither one of us...\u201d\n\nJoel Dresang: [singing] \u201cWants to be the first to say. Neither one of us.\u201d [music clip plays]\n\n\u201c...wants to be the first to say, neither one of us!\u201d\n\nKim Shine: Joel is...Joel is becoming a pimp right now.\n\nJoel Dresang: Because I've had it in my head this whole week. But. But I think that's how it goes a lot of times, because you're in a relationship and not all relationships are meant to last forever. And...\n\nYeah, and yet a lot of times, relationships, you know, overstay their welcome because nobody wants to be the bad guy.\n\nKim Shine: You're holding on. Yeah.\n\nJoel Dresang: So, so, I have an example of, of, I used to be in a comedy group called Sketch Marx. It was a sketch comedy group. It was a great name. And we were together for five years and had some success and had a lot of one of our taglines was friends on stage having fun, and that's what it was.\n\nBut it got to a point where it wasn't as much fun, and I was afraid that it was going to end friendships. So, I did as one of the people in the group later said, I did the kill shot and and told everybody, hey, great time, let's quit.\n\nKim Shine: It\u2019s over!\n\nJoel Dresang : Yeah, let's quit while we're still ahead.\n\nKim Shine: While we're still friends.\n\nJoel Dresang: Yeah. And, you know, not everybody took it well to begin with. But the first email of that I got back after I did that, somebody said, thank you for doing what I didn't have the nerve to do so, but but sometimes that has to happen.\n\nKim Shine: Yeah. And if you can feel it, just go ahead and do it.\n\nJoel Dresang: Yes, yes.\n\nKim Shine: And it'll be okay. I don't have any breakup stories I want to share, per say.\n\nJoel Dresang: Oh, come on.\n\nKim Shine: I mean, they I, I cry, they hurt my feelings. So, I'm like, oh, I hurt my feelings. Oh, it's so bad. So, I don't share my breakup stories. But I will say that breakups don't necessarily have to be people.\n\nJoel Dresang: Right? Yeah. You break up with a job sometimes. Yes. Or they break up with you.\n\nKim Shine: Right. Haha. Bye! Right. And so I think my I think I'm in a period of life right now where I'm breaking up from just a lot of old things, just kind, similar to your story and I'm just kind of moving on. And that's what when I came up with the breakup theme, that's more so what I was looking for. Just stories about moving ahead, moving forward.\n\nKim Shine: So let's get to the stories okay. Our first story comes from Craig Wiroll. During the \u201cDeal Breaker\u201d Slam in April 2019, Craig learned that mistakes happen and sometimes they make for a funnier tale later on.\n\nCraig Wiroll: Oh, hey everyone, I've been a bit homesick, so it's nice to hear, about the Steinhoffels. That was nice. I just drove here from LA three days ago, and I've been away for about a decade, so it's nice to be home. So that story was interesting. Christine, was that your fake name? But we both just drove across the country.\n\nSo, I'm going to tell you about a deal breaker I've been trying to get rid of my whole life. So this goes back to when I was 16 years old. So there was this girl I was chatting up on. AIM. That\u2019s AOL Instant Messenger. We were talking for years. We both like the same ska music and the same punk music. We both had...\n\nThis is an odd thing, but we both had very large aunts and we bonded over it, her aunt and my aunt for being large, funny people, and we're like, haha, we have similar aunts and just stupid juvenile stuff, and we're like, we're made for each other. So it took a couple of years, but my friend was like, I'm going over to her house, do you want to come with?\n\nAnd I'm like, oh my God, oh my God, this is a big deal. I was not a cool kid. So at 16, this is like my first time I have a chance to meet a girl. I'm excited. We go over there and I'm shy. She's shy, she's nervous, and we're making each other laugh. So it's going really well.\n\nAnd I'm starting to get these butterflies. I'm like, how do I\u2014How do I keep these feelings going? I'm liking this. And, you know, we didn't nothing happened that day. We go home or I go home. We keep chatting online and I'm like, man, this is exciting. I want to go hang out with her again. I ask her to come over to my house.\n\nAnd, you know, we're watching, like, America's Funniest Home Videos, whatever people do in those early 20s and, we're laughing, we're having a great time. And she starts moving her face towards my face. So I have to say, I grew up a very shy, fat, weird kid that no one liked. And I just played video games and drew, I was, I was weird, I was a little weirdo.\n\nI just hid behind my mom all the time. So this was the first time I've had this experience of a face coming towards my face out of admiration, and I, I, I ducked, I dove, I dove out of the way, and then it was so awkward after that. I'm rubbing my neck. I'm like, so I guess I should drive you home.\n\nShe didn't have her license yet, but a week later, I go to her house. I go to her house and we're in the basement. We're watching Disney Channel or something like that. You know what cool kids do? And I'm like, alright, I'm ready. And she's looking me in that\u2014She's giving me that same look in the eyes.\n\nShe's forgiven me. And so I'm like, I can do this. And we rub faces together, specifically our mouth part of our faces. So it's kind of like a kiss. My first kiss. And I get in the car. It's December in Wisconsin. I'm from Sheboygan. I get in the car, I'm on the highway. I'm elated. I'm like, I feel like my car just starts going into the clouds.\n\nI'm so happy on my way home. And then someone just storms by me going like 80mph and I'm like, you jerk, and I shouldn't have done that because, you know, there's no friction on the road. So my car starts spinning, spins like eight times on 43. Is that the highway? I've been away for a while. It spins, it spins, it's spins.\n\nAnd then it's like, dangling over the side and I'm like, what the hell? I almost died. But then I, like, look up into the clouds. I'm like, I don't care. I'm so happy right now. I didn't care, I almost died and I couldn't get back on the road. Luckily, a cop came by, helped me back onto the highway, and I proceeded, but it didn't matter anyway.\n\nI go to her house the next time. It's my birthday. I'm really excited. She made a card for me, so she gives me the card and then she says, \u201cI'm going to get back together with my ex-boyfriend. Sorry. Bye.\u201d I was so heartbroken. So heartbroken. But a year later, it felt like forever in teenage years. But a year later, my friend is like, \u201cI'm going to the beach with my girlfriend.\n\nThere's this other girl there. You should come. Her name is Jessie.\u201d And I was like, oh, Jessie, is that my, non possessive, Jessie? The Jessie I know? So I join them, and it is her and she looks better than ever and I'm so excited. We walk hand in hand on the lighthouse in Sheboygan. We are, like, it's just like old times.\n\nIt all comes right back. So for hours we walk. We laugh up the up the lighthouse and, you know, back along the beach. And at the end she looks me in the eye. That same look that I recognize from earlier, you know, a year ago. And I look her in the eye and she says, \u201cWhat do you think?\n\nShould we give it another shot like old times?\u201d And I say, \u201cYou know what? You broke my heart and you can\u201d\u2014Are we allowed to swear?\u2014\u201cand you can go f yourself!\u201d And I stormed off with my pride. And to this day I hate myself. I, I so badly wanted to be happy, but I am such a proud, stupid moron.\n\nI didn't allow myself to be happy. So that is a deal breaker that I'm working to work on is forgiving people, getting over things. And, you know, people make mistakes, and you got to let them do that. But, a little follow up real quick. Ten years later, I pull up to a stop sign when I'm visiting my mom back in Sheboygan, I look over, I see Jessie.\n\nWe don't make that same face, slightly different this time because her husband's also looking at me, and the two kids in the back seat are also looking at me. So I just give her the little nod like, hey, how's it going? And she gives me the nod like, I see you. I see you seeing me. And that was it.\n\nI've never seen her again. That was about eight years ago now. So thank you.\n\nKim Shine: So, that was Craig Wiroll and we have an update from him. So Craig visited his hometown back in 2021 and a randomly ran into his 16 year old love. She invited him out to dinner. He learned that she had a son, so he introduced himself as an old friend. But ultimately their paths had gone in different directions and the chemistry was gone.\n\nKim Shine: Now, Craig did give us another update about a second relationship, but it's a long story short, love is still very much an elusive situation for him.\n\nJoel Dresang: But he's still getting stories out of it.\n\nKim Shine: Yes.\n\nJoel Dresang: Oh, that's not all bad.\n\nKim Shine: Positive, positive!\n\nJoel Dresang: UltraShorts?\n\nKim Shine: Yes. Let's do.\n\nJoel Dresang: Them. Okay, so ultra shorts are a little 2 to 3 sentences that have the relationship to the theme of the StorySlam. And you write it on a slip of paper and the hosts read them.\n\nKim Shine: Yeah. Let's go.\n\nJoel Dresang: Okay. You got one\n\nKim Shine: I do. This one is from Nope. \u201cMy ex-girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together over ten times. The strong attraction remains. It's been over two years since we've dated. Then on a recent snowy evening, we got together and quote \u201cused our time wisely, if you know what I mean.\u201d And she's sitting next to me right now.\n\nJoel Dresang: Oh, that's sweet. This one is from anonymous. \u201cIn sixth grade my girlfriend dumped me which was great because I found out I liked boys.\u201d\n\nKim Shine: This one here is also from anonymous. \u201cAn old friend was consoling me after I discovered my girlfriend had been cheating on me. Turns out, he was the person she was sleeping with.\u201d\n\nJoel Dresang: Here's another ultra-short from anonymous. \u201cMy first real boyfriend was my first kiss. His breath was terrible. It constantly smelled like stale KitKats and Mountain Dew.\u201d\n\nKim Shine: What?!\n\nJoel Dresang: \u201cTo top it off. My dog is less sloppy with his kisses. Hard pass.\u201d\n\nKim Shine: Yeah, I'm with you, anonymous. Hard pass.\n\nJoel Dresang: Our second breakup story is from Tony Anderson at the Adulting StorySlam in April 2024. Tony's breakup was actually with his career, and what happened next was literally life changing. Here's Tony.\n\nTony Anderson: So, as adults, we all make decisions that are going to affect our lives, but the decisions that we make in our 20s are not necessarily the decisions that we would make when we're 40, in our 40s. So I want to tell you about the biggest breakup of my life. I didn't mean for it to happen. In fact, I spent a lot of time developing the relationship.\n\nBut after nearly 20 years, I had to walk away. I had to say goodbye to my relationship with journalism.\n\nIt was a tough, tough decision. I didn't mean for it to happen. In fact, journalism and I had built a really good life together. It all started back in college. We had this communications class together. The next semester, we had a couple more classes, and one class led to another until we developed a major relationship and it didn't end there.\n\nWe went to graduate school together and after graduation we decided to make our relationship official. And so I took a job writing for a community newspaper. We weren't making a lot of money, but that didn't matter because we were spending our days and many of our nights together.\n\nOver time, our relationship evolved, and whether covering elections or writing heartwarming feature stories, journalism and I remained close.\n\nAnd then I got a job working for a legal newspaper, and the passion exploded as I combined my love of the law with writing and reporting. I worked my way up into a management position as the managing editor of the Wisconsin Law Journal, and it was great. We went on that way for years, and I watched as some of my coworkers began breaking up.\n\nThey started new relationships with marketing and grant writing and corporate communications. But I knew that my relationship was strong. And then one day, I started stepping out. I wouldn't call it cheating. Some people refer to it as volunteering.\n\nI started going over to a school located at Fourth and National and working through the Junior Achievement Program, I worked with an amazing third grade teacher in a bilingual classroom. It was an amazing experience. I didn't plan for it to go any further. It was just a few hours here and there. Nothing important, nothing big. We went on that way for about five years and slowly I realized that I was falling in love with teaching.\n\nThere was something amazing about standing up in front of a group of students and engaging them in conversation that led to new ideas. I can't describe the magic of that light bulb moment when a student's eyes light up as they understand the concept that have been out of reach. I didn't try to hide what was going on.\n\nFamily and friends started noticing. The teacher that I was working with noticed and she told me that I should make a break. My wife noticed too. She said that I was much more excited coming home from working with those students than I was coming home from the newspaper.\n\nSo, I started thinking, and I realized that I wasn't the same person who had come into this relationship as a college student. I wanted more, and I told that to my publisher. She was incredibly supportive. And so, as a 45-year-old, I went back to school and got my teaching certification. Now, I know some of you might be thinking this is just another midlife crisis, but you'd be wrong.\n\nI've been teaching for the last 13 years, and I look forward to every day that I get to spend with my seven- and eight-year-olds.\n\nIt's fun, it's exciting, and it is incredibly rewarding. I am so grateful that I had the support of family and friends, as I was able to embark on this new, amazing relationship. Thank you.\n\nJoel Dresang: That was Tony Anderson from a StorySlam in April 2024.\n\nKim Shine: Yeah. And you had asked me before if if me leaving TV news and coming into...and being into radio, if that was me kind of breaking up with journalism.\n\nJoel Dresang: Yes.\n\nKim Shine: Honestly, I don't think so. I'm still in media. I still love journalism. I'm doing\u2014 I'm definitely doing something totally different, different types of challenges and different types of environments, but I don't think so because I still love it.\n\nJoel Dresang: And, you know, and it's interesting because sometimes you break up from a relationship and sometimes relationships just change. And the nature of journalism is changing. And so, you know, you really haven't left the profession. You're still practicing it in different ways.\n\nKim Shine: Yeah, I would say it's more of an evolution. It was funny to me, somebody said that I had retired. And I died laughing because I never thought of it that way. I, I kind of think it's more like...\n\nJoel Dresang: Do you get like, a pension and stuff?\n\nKim Shine: I know, right? Like, can I get some money? Shoot. But no, I, I thought of it more as, like a sabbatical. Kinda sorta.\n\nJoel Dresang: Yeah, sure.\n\nKim Shine: I think I've just, you know, taking a pause, exploring new things. And maybe I'll come back one day.\n\nJoel Dresang: You know, I worked in journalism for 30 years, and, and I still sort of view myself as a journalist, but I, I'm not working in journalism anymore, but I view things that way.\n\nKim Shine: Yeah.\n\nJoel Dresang: Sometimes I refer to myself as a a journalist emeritus.\n\nKim Shine: Oh, I like that. I like that because the thing about it with this industry, as you know, it teaches you so much like, so many life skills that you can apply to anything. I mean, in my own life, I'm not going to say, like, sometimes stress stresses me out, but if there's other situations or other people, I can be so calm under pressure.\n\nKim Shine: Yes. I can be focused, I can do my job and, you know, just get things done. And I like that about what I've learned.\n\nJoel Dresang: Yeah. I mean, just being able to work on deadlines, to be able to to think quickly, to be able to get along with other people. Yeah. Talk with them, to relate to them. And I mean, one of the biggest things that we got out of journalism, or that you're still getting out of journalism, is storytelling.\n\nKim Shine: That is so true. Bring it, bring it back to the show, Joel. That is exactly what it is. And I don't know if we've done an episode on this, but I just have always been a curious, mischievous person, you know, shout out to episode five. But I've been able to kind of nurture my curiosity through journalism and through storytelling.\n\nJoel Dresang: Yes, I often think of journalism as, being respectfully curious.\n\nKim Shine: Yes, yes. Our final story. Guys, I know we're going to have to break up with you guys soon. Our final story is from Kennita Hickman. She told this one back in November of 2019. And if you're looking for the sad story of this episode, this one might come close. But you'll see that there's always a silver lining and always the option to choose yourself.\n\nKennita Hickman: So, this story is going to contain some TMI. And both of my bosses are in the room tonight, so....Exactly, David. Yeesh. So, I was really excited because my boyfriend was coming by and, I hadn't seen him in a couple months. We both lived in Milwaukee. All of my friends thought that was weird. I was not as troubled by that.\n\nI kind of liked the space. So he's coming by and we're going to spend some time together. So he brings me food. That's a good sign. And, we're sitting on the couch and we're watching a commercial, and it's like one of those overstock commercials where, like, the husband is opening these cabinets and finding, like, bulk paper products everywhere.\n\nAnd he's like, what? Like, what is this? Because his wife is, like, spent all this money and my partner at the time says to me, \u201cOh my gosh, I cannot wait until my wife does that. Can you imagine, like, how much money you have to spend or how much money you have to make for your wife to be able to spend money and you not know what she's spending it on.\u201d\n\nAnd as I'm sitting there, what I heard was he imagined wealth. He'd imagined being married again. He'd imagined what it would look like to have that type of money. But he didn't see me as his wife.\n\nNow, I wish I could tell you that I did not join him back at his house for adult activities later on that evening. I did, but as adult activities, as adult activities are happening, my spirit is saying, sis, he did not say you. And so as he went off to his slumber, I am still like laying there like crying silently because I knew I had to say goodbye and I just wasn't sure how.\n\nIt took me six weeks to get the courage. And I remember during that six weeks my birthday came and I had filmed an episode of this vlog that I'm working on, and I remember it was my birthday, and I was on vacation from my job., Ex Fabula, and all I wanted that night was for him to call, and he never called, like, never called.\n\nSo, not only is it my birthday, but I just executive produced my first series and I couldn't even share it with him. It still took me another two weeks to break up with him, and I did it through text message because I couldn't find him.\n\nSo, I sent a text message. I felt like I was in a good place. And it's interesting because during the duration of our relationship, I had been doing some healing and trauma work, and I thought that the healing and trauma was so that I could be a better partner to him. And I feel like the the culmination of that trauma or the healing was so that I could leave him and recognize my own strength.\n\nAnd so I did, and I didn't hear from him until I changed my LinkedIn profile, saying that I was now a director for artist support and outreach for Imagine MKE. Three hours later, I get a text message that says, I want to apologize. Please pick up your phone. So I pick it up and he apologizes and blah, blah, blah.\n\nAnd so because I'm, I'm a fairly blunt person, I was like, so what do you want? Are you apologizing for the sake of apologizing? Are you apologizing because you want some conversation over coffee and you want to kind of see what goes on, or you apologize because you're interested in engaging in some funny shit, let me know so that I can pivot.\n\nRight? And he was like, well, now that you mentioned the latter... Right. So as this call is happening a few weeks ago, keep in mind I've started casually dating someone else. So I call that person and I say, \u201cHey, my ex just called and I'm probably gonna go for it. Like, no, no, no, I'm not going to date him.\n\nBut I mean he has some good benefits that I really like. Don't judge me.\u201d\n\nSo, so my, my current casual partner is like, \u201cDo what you do, be responsible.\u201d And I was like, oh, all right. Well, it wound up not happening because it turns out he's still him. And while he talked about all of this change that he made, when I took the moment via text message to say to him, you really hurt me that moment on the couch because this is what I heard.\n\nAnd when he became defensive, I recognize that engaging with him sexually like that would just be detrimental to my spirit. And I had worked really hard to like, fix and heal myself. And so I officially said goodbye and I blocked him.\n\nYeah!\n\nKim Shine: That was Kennita Hickman. So, Joel.\n\nJoel Dresang: Yes, Kim?\n\nKim Shine: Should we do some more UltraShorts?\n\nJoel Dresang: We should.\n\nKim Shine: You got one?\n\nJoel Dresang: Yeah, I do, this is from anonymous \u201cSpent the better part of my 20s (and this is in quotes) \u201cdating my father.\u201d Needless to say, they're all now my ex.\u201d\n\nKim Shine: This one here is from Lori. \u201cAbsolutely fell in love with a guy when I was 18 in Illinois. We went our separate ways, and at 27 and newly divorced and moved to Riverwest from Mequon, three blocks away from that 18 year old guy. Five years later, got married during Riverwest24. We were a bonus checkpoint. Celebrating eight years of marriage in 2025.\n\nJoel Dresang: Wow, mazel tov. That's great.\n\nKim Shine: Yeah. This one here is from AMP or A-M-P. We got some initials here possibly. \u201cI knew it was really over when he deleted my profile from his Netflix account.\u201d Sad face.\n\nJoel Dresang: That's a breakup. Yes.\n\nKim Shine: And guys, that's all the time we have for this episode of Real Stories MKE. But Ex Fabula has more stories to share. It's been hosting StorySlams since 29, and there are more audio and video stories at exfabula.org.\n\nJoel Dresang: And the stories keep on coming. The Ex Fabula website lists upcoming storytelling workshops and StorySlams, and that's so you can join in on the storytelling. You can also connect with Ex Fabula on Facebook, Instagram, X. Bluesky and TikTok. And subscribe to Real Stories MKE wherever you get podcasts.\n\nKim Shine: There's so many ways to stay connected. Okay guys, thanks to everybody who makes this program possible, including Ex Fabula staff, the storytellers, our producer, Jordan Terry and audio engineer, Sam Woods.\n\nJoel Dresang: Thanks, Sam.\n\nKim Shine: And thank you to all the financial supporters of Ex Fabula, including the Wisconsin Arts Board, CAMPAC, and Ex Fabula members.\n\nJoel Dresang: For Real Stories MKE, I'm Joel Dresang.\n\nKim Shine: And I am Kim Shine. Thank you so much for listening. And don't forget: everybody has a story to tell. Think of telling yours.",

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Mike Bird from Pexels\n\nConducting scientific studies is never easy, and there are often major disasters along the way. A researcher accidentally spills coffee on a keyboard, destroying the data. Or one of the chemicals used in the analysis is contaminated, and the list goes on.\n\nHowever, when we read the results of the study in a scientific paper, it always looks pristine. The study went smoothly with no hiccups, and here are our results.\n\nBut studies can contain errors, not all of which independent experts or \"peer reviewers\" weed out before publication.\n\nStatistical stuff-ups can be difficult to find as it really takes someone trained in statistics to notice something wrong.\n\nWhen statistical mistakes are made and found, it can have profound impacts on people who may have changed their lifestyle as a result of the flawed study.\n\nThese three examples of inadvertent statistical mistakes have had major consequences for our health and shopping habits.\n\n1. Did you throw out your black plastic spoons?\n\nLate last year, I came across a news article about how black plastic kitchen utensils were dangerous as they could potentially leak toxic flame-retardant chemicals into your food.\n\nBeing a natural skeptic, I looked up the original paper, which was published in the journal Chemosphere. The article looked genuine, the journal was reputable. So\u2014like perhaps many other people\u2014I threw out my black plastic kitchen utensils and replaced them with silicone ones.\n\nIn the study, the authors screened 203 household products (about half were kitchen utensils) made from black plastic.\n\nThe authors found toxic flame retardants in 85% of the products tested, with levels approaching the maximum daily limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States.\n\nUnfortunately, the authors made a mistake in their calculations. They were out by a factor of 10. This meant the level of toxic chemicals was well under the daily safety limits.\n\nIn recent weeks, the authors apologized and corrected their paper.\n\n2. Did you avoid HRT?\n\nA landmark study raised safety concerns about hormone replacement therapy or HRT (now also known as menopausal hormone therapy). This highlights a different type of statistical error.\n\nThe Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study involved 10,739 postmenopausal women aged 50\u201379 recruited from 40 clinical centers in the US. It compared the health of women randomized to take HRT with those who took the placebo. Neither the researchers nor the women knew which treatment had been given.\n\nIn their 2002 paper, the authors reported higher rates of invasive breast cancers in the HRT group. They used a unit called \"person-years.\" Person-years is a way to measure the total time a group of people spends in a study. For example, if 100 people are in a study for one year each, that makes 100 person-years. If someone leaves the trial after only six months, only that half-year is counted for them.\n\nThe authors showed a rate of 38 invasive breast cancers per 10,000 person-years in the HRT group, compared to 30 per 10,000 person-years in the placebo group. This gives a rate ratio of 1.26 (one rate divided by the other).\n\nThis fairly large increase in breast cancer rates, also expressed as a 26% increase, caused widespread panic around the world, and led to thousands of women stopping HRT.\n\nBut the actual risk of breast cancer in each group is low. The rate of 38 per 10,000 person-years is equivalent to an annual rate of 0.38%. With very small rates like this, the authors should really have used the rate difference rather than the rate ratio. The rate difference is one rate subtracted from the other, rather than divided by it. This equates to an annual increase of 0.08% breast cancer cases in the HRT group\u2014much more modest.\n\nThe authors of the 2002 paper also pointed out that the 26% increase in the rate of breast cancer \"almost reached nominal statistical significance.\" Almost is not statistical significance, and formally, this means there was no difference in breast cancer rates between the two groups. In other words, the difference between the two groups could have happened by chance.\n\nThe authors should have been more careful when describing their results.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Did Popeye's spinach change your meals?\n\nCartoon character Popeye is a one-eyed, pipe-smoking sailor with mangled English, in love with the willowy Olive Oyl. He is constantly getting into trouble, and when he needs extra energy, he opens a can of spinach and swallows the contents. His biceps immediately bulge, and off he goes to sort out the problem.\n\nWhen Popeye ate spinach, his muscles bulged. No wonder sales of spinach rose.\n\nBut why does Popeye eat spinach?\n\nThe story begins in about 1870, with a German chemist, Erich von Wolf or Emil von Wolff, depending on which version of events you read.\n\nHe was measuring the amount of iron in different types of leafy vegetables. According to legend, which some dispute, he was writing the iron content of spinach down in a notebook and got the decimal point wrong, writing 35 milligrams instead of 3.5 milligrams per 100 gram serve of spinach. The error was found and corrected in 1937.\n\nBy then the Popeye character had been created and spinach became incredibly popular with children. Apparently, consumption of spinach in the US went up by a third as a result of the cartoon.\n\nThis story had gained legendary status but has one tiny flaw. In a 1932 cartoon, Popeye explains exactly why he eats spinach, and it's nothing to do with iron. He says in his garbled English:\n\n\"Spinach is full of Vitamin A. An'tha's what makes hoomans strong an' helty!\"\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.",

            "content": "United Parcel Service (UPS 1.33%), usually just known by its ticker UPS, has been working through a turnaround. Wall Street hasn't been impressed with its efforts, but in the back half of 2024, the company's performance turned an important corner. Right at that moment, management announced a big change in its relationship with its largest customer, which upset investors anew. Here are three reasons why now is the time to buy this stock.\n\n1. UPS looks attractively priced\n\nUPS' stock is trading near 52-week lows, down around 20% over the year. The shares have lost half their value since hitting a peak in early 2022. This is an unloved company right now. The dividend yield is up to 4.8%, which is near the highest levels in the company's history. Notably, the yield is higher now than it was during the Great Recession, when the world was concerned that the entire global financial system might collapse. From these perspectives, the stock looks deeply unloved.\n\nThat story is backed up by looking at more traditional valuation metrics. The price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-book value ratios are all below their five-year averages right now. To be fair, there are reasons for the company to be out of favor, including a period of weak operating performance.\n\nHowever, management has been addressing the issues it faces, and in the back half of 2024, key performance metrics started to improve. In the third quarter of that year, CEO Carol Tome announced that the company had \"returned to revenue and profit growth.\" Effectively, she was telling the world that UPS had finally turned the corner, with further improvement in the fourth quarter confirming the positive momentum.\n\nSo UPS appears to be out of favor, but it is now working from a position of strength and not weakness. That's important, because the opportunity right now is seeing the good news in the bad news management announced in Q4 (more on this below).\n\n2. UPS has a system that's hard to match\n\nOne of the key things to remember about UPS is that it is a logistics giant. The company's brown-clad employees and trucks can be seen in every city and town in a coordinated dance that allows for packages to be delivered quickly and in a cost-effective fashion.\n\nThere is a lot more to the puzzle than just those trucks and employees. There are sorting facilities, airplanes, and a store base that allows UPS a business reach that would be hard, if not impossible, to replicate. Even Amazon (AMZN 2.09%) has yet to fully match what UPS has to offer (more on this below, too).\n\nThe only other major competitors out there are the U.S. Post Office, Duetsche Post (owner of DHL) and FedEx, which is focused more heavily on the overnight delivery niche. There have been attempts by European competitors to break into the U.S. market, but they haven't panned out quite as well as hoped.\n\nThis isn't to suggest that UPS' business position could never be disrupted. But UPS clearly has a well-entrenched business, and given the upturn in its business performance, it seems likely that it will be able to protect that position, despite Wall Street's concerns about the company right now.\n\n3. UPS really upset Wall Street with its Amazon announcement\n\nSo UPS stock looks cheap despite improving performance, and UPS has a strong market position. Why is the stock so unloved, with a steep decline after Q4 2024 earnings? Just as the company was explaining that it had turned an important corner performance-wise, it announced that it was going to reduce its dealing with its largest customer, Amazon. The business it does with the online retail giant is slated to fall by 50%!\n\nInstead of looking at this decision and fearing the outcome, it's important to ask why this is being done now. First, as noted above, management clearly believes that it has turned an important corner with the business. Working from a position of strength, it is now trying to fine-tune its operating performance. UPS has been looking to focus on higher-margin business, and Amazon just doesn't fit that mold, since it is a high-volume but low-margin customer. The relationship between the two companies won't end, with UPS noting that it offers return services that Amazon doesn't.\n\nWhile it is true that this decision will likely hurt the company's business in the near term, it will strengthen it over the long term. Notably, it will allow the company's higher-margin operations (which are growing in areas like healthcare) to shine through in its financial performance. It will also free up the company to expand in more profitable areas, because it won't be wasting resources on the low-margin Amazon business. In other words, UPS is upgrading its business. That's not a bad thing. In fact, it should probably be seen as a very good thing for investors who think in decades and not days.\n\nHold your nose and buy UPS\n\nThe turnaround at UPS is clearly still a work in progress, so this stock probably isn't the best choice for risk-averse investors. However, if you like turnarounds or have a penchant for high-yield stocks, you'll want to take a close look at UPS today. If you wait until some distant tomorrow, you might miss the opportunity to buy it. Remember, it has an attractive valuation and high yield and a well-situated business, and it's willing to make the hard calls that will make the company better over the long term.",

USA TODAY\n\nMonday, Feb. 17 is Presidents Day, a federal holiday to observe the birthdays of former presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nWhile the holiday is sometimes misunderstood as a celebration of the lives and birthdays of all U.S. presidents, the holiday was initially called Washington's Birthday. It was the first federal holiday to honor an individual's birth date.\n\nWashington's birthday, Feb. 22, was designated by Congress as a holiday for all federal workers in 1885. In 1971, the Uniform Monday Holiday Law changed the date to the third Monday in February, according to the National Archives. It adds that the position of the holiday between the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln, whose birthday is Feb. 12, gave rise to the popular name of Presidents Day.\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2025? Here's everything to know including what is open and closed\n\nWhile most restaurants, grocery stores, and retail stores will remain open on Feb. 17, that will not happen for banks, post offices, and the stock market.

But from outside the simulator, the Atherton High School sophomore was only a few feet off the ground.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking about becoming a pilot one day,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nBishop said the state-of-the-art cockpit looks and responds in every way he\u2019d expect a fully loaded cargo plane should.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just a matter of how realistic it is; everything is down to the smallest detail, every little thing is there,\" Bishop said. \"It\u2019s all extremely impressive, and it all gives you a really good perspective of just what it\u2019s like.\"\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what the UPS Global Aviation Training Center delivers. It\u2019s the training center for hundreds of pilots throughout the year.\n\nInstead of UPS pilots taking the reigns, students in Atherton's Aerospace program got a crack at the simulators on Friday.

Inside: a fully automatic military assault rifle, a silencer and a deepening mystery that stretched far beyond stolen mail.\n\nThe case began Tuesday, when two donors who had mailed checks to Dogwood Animal Rescue reached out, requesting donation receipts. The organization\u2019s executives soon realized the funds had never arrived at their rented mailbox inside a UPS store on Fulton Road. When they urged donors to check their bank statements, they found that the checks had been deposited into an unknown account.\n\nSuspicion quickly turned to the UPS store itself. After learning that a store employee might be involved, the nonprofit alerted Santa Rosa police.\n\nBy Wednesday, detectives with the Property Crimes Investigations Unit had zeroed in on Jennifer Chenier, 36, a Santa Rosa resident employed at the UPS store. She had access to the nonprofit\u2019s mailbox \u2014 and, investigators suspected, the donations that had gone missing.\n\nShortly before 3 p.m.Wednesday, plainclothes detectives moved in. They arrested Chenier at work and searched her vehicle and residence in the 2200 block of Dancing Penny Way. What they found confirmed their suspicions: 30 stolen donation checks, worth more than $18,000, along with mail stolen from other rental mailboxes.\n\nDogwood Animal Rescue, a Sonoma County-based, volunteer-driven nonprofit that provides medical care, foster placement and adoption services, urged donors who had not received tax acknowledgments to contact them at info@dogwoodanimalrescue.org.\n\n(Dogwood Animal Rescue)\n\n\u201cWe are disheartened that anyone would steal from our kind donors, our animals and our volunteer team,\u201d the organization\u2019s Board of Directors said in a statement.\n\nDogwood officials were not immediately available for comment Friday afternoon.\n\nThe case appeared to be a straightforward fraud investigation \u2014 until Thursday, when detectives executed a second search warrant at Chenier\u2019s residence. Hidden inside a locked red suitcase, they found a short-barreled Colt M4 fully automatic military assault rifle and a silencer. The rifle lacked a serial number, and on its side was a stark warning: \u201cMilitary and Law Enforcement Use Only.\u201d\n\nInvestigators also learned that Chenier was a narcotics addict, prohibited from owning firearms. That revelation added a new set of charges, including possession of an assault rifle, a machine gun, a short-barreled rifle, a silencer and possession of a firearm by a narcotics addict.\n\nPolice are now investigating whether other individuals may have fallen victim to financial crimes linked to Chenier\u2019s notary services.\n\n\u201cIf you rent a mailbox from this location or have sent financial documents such as checks to a mailbox at this location, you are encouraged to check your financial records for suspicious or fraudulent activity,\u201d police said in a statement.\n\nChenier was booked into the Sonoma County jail on suspicion of felony forgery, identity theft, commercial burglary and possession of personal identification information for 10 or more individuals with the intent to defraud.\n\nAuthorities urge anyone who may have been affected by the scheme to contact the Santa Rosa Police Department\u2019s tip line at 707-543-3575.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Alana Minkler at 707-526-8531 or alana.minkler@pressdemocrat.com.

Bloomberg Law reported the selection Tuesday. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the nominee.\n\nKeeling was director of road and transportation safety at Amazon.com Inc. for nearly two years from 2021 to 2023, after serving in numerous safety positions at UPS since 1985, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nBoth companies have had numerous interactions with the agency Keeling has been selected to lead.\n\nIn December, Amazon agreed to institute new ergonomic safety procedures at its facilities nationwide as part of a deal to resolve multiple OSHA violations stemming from investigations that started in 2022, when Keeling was at the company.\n\nUPS has also recently been embroiled in a legal battle with the agency in Delaware federal court over efforts to install heat-stress monitoring devices in its trucks.\n\nAmazon and UPS didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on Keeling.\n\nStaffing Woes\n\nTrump\u2019s pick of Keeling has largely been met with praise from the business community, and slight relief from worker safety advocates who feared a less qualified choice.\n\n\u201cHe is an excellent choice for the position, and he does have good, solid technical credentials,\u201d said Roger King, senior labor and employment counsel at the HR Policy Association. \u201cHe has an excellent practical grasp of what needs to be done and what should be done on work or safety issues.\u201d\n\nIf confirmed to the position, Keeling will be tasked with balancing Trump\u2019s efforts to reduce the size of the federal workforce with the enforcement sub-agency\u2019s mission to ensure workers are safe on the job.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t include exceptions in his federal hiring freeze for workplace safety investigators or other OSHA enforcement staff. The agency has only 1,850 inspectors on staff to inspect more than 8 million workplaces, according to its website.\n\nHow many inspectors the agency has on board and how the division is structured will be a \u201cvery important consideration\u201d for Keeling, King added.\n\nPolicy Pressures\n\nThe former corporate safety director would also facee competing pressures to address workplace safety risks, such as rising temperatures and infectious diseases, while delivering on Trump\u2019s regulation slashing agenda.\n\nUnder the previous administration\u2019s leadership, OSHA had most recently been working to finalize protections for workers from high heat and was defending a rulemaking to expand who can join workplace safety inspections. Unions representing health-care workers have also been pressing the agency to issue rules to protect staff from infectious diseases.\n\nKeeling will be under pressure to take some of these initiatives across the finish line. Jessica E. Martinez, executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, said her group wants OSHA to adopt a national heat rule.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, OSHA must be a strong and proactive agency that enforces safety laws, protects all workers, and moves urgently to adopt critical new standards, including a national heat protection rule,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite Keeling\u2019s background as a health and safety expert, at least one workplace safety expert is concerned about the influence Trump will have over the agency\u2019s policy goals.\n\n\u201cHe has a health and safety background, so I\u2019m sure he gets the need to protect workers. However, he\u2019s in the Trump administration, who\u2019s following the playbook of Project 2025,\u201d said Debbie Berkowitz, who served as a senior adviser at OSHA during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cHe will preside over a real effort to weaken already minimal worker safety protections,\u201d added Berkowitz, who is now with Georgetown University\u2019s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor.\n\nIf approved by the Senate, Keeling would report to Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who has been nominated to serve as Secretary of Labor.\n\nBoth Keeling and Chavez-DeRemer have ties back to the Teamsters union. Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s nomination was backed by Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien. The Teamsters also represent workers at UPS and Amazon, Keeling\u2019s past employers.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with David Keeling to ensure the safety of America\u2019s workers,\u201d the Teamsters said in a statement on the nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive that he has worked shifts sorting packages and knows how demanding such work can be.\u201d",

The team of researchers said the new interpretation of humanity's origin increases the probability of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Credit: NASA\n\nHumanity may not be extraordinary but rather the natural evolutionary outcome for our planet and likely others, according to a new model for how intelligent life developed on Earth.\n\nThe model, which upends the decades-old \"hard steps\" theory that intelligent life was an incredibly improbable event, suggests that maybe it wasn't all that hard or improbable. A team of researchers at Penn State, who led the work, said the new interpretation of humanity's origin increases the probability of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.\n\n\"This is a significant shift in how we think about the history of life,\" said Jennifer Macalady, professor of geosciences at Penn State and co-author on the paper, which was published Feb. 14 in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\"It suggests that the evolution of complex life may be less about luck and more about the interplay between life and its environment, opening up exciting new avenues of research in our quest to understand our origins and our place in the universe.\"\n\nInitially developed by theoretical physicist Brandon Carter in 1983, the \"hard steps\" model argues that our evolutionary origin was highly unlikely due to the time it took for humans to evolve on Earth relative to the total lifespan of the sun\u2014and therefore the likelihood of human-like beings beyond Earth is extremely low.\n\nIn the new study, a team of researchers that included astrophysicists and geobiologists argued that Earth's environment was initially inhospitable to many forms of life, and that key evolutionary steps only became possible when the global environment reached a \"permissive\" state.\n\nFor example, complex animal life requires a certain level of oxygen in the atmosphere, so the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere through photosynthesizing microbes and bacteria was a natural evolutionary step for the planet, which created a window of opportunity for more recent life forms to develop, explained Dan Mills, postdoctoral researcher at The University of Munich and lead author on the paper.\n\n\"We're arguing that intelligent life may not require a series of lucky breaks to exist,\" said Mills, who worked in Macalady's astrobiology lab at Penn State as an undergraduate researcher.\n\n\"Humans didn't evolve 'early' or 'late' in Earth's history, but 'on time,\" when the conditions were in place. Perhaps it's only a matter of time, and maybe other planets are able to achieve these conditions more rapidly than Earth did, while other planets might take even longer.\"\n\nThe central prediction of the \"hard steps\" theory states that very few, if any, other civilizations exist throughout the universe, because steps such as the origin of life, the development of complex cells and the emergence of human intelligence are improbable based on Carter's interpretation of the sun's total lifespan being 10 billion years, and the Earth's age of around 5 billion years.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers proposed that the timing of human origins can be explained by the sequential opening of \"windows of habitability\" over Earth's history, driven by changes in nutrient availability, sea surface temperature, ocean salinity levels and the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

If life evolves with the planet, then it will evolve on a planetary time scale at a planetary pace.\"\n\nWright explained that part of the reason that the \"hard steps\" model has prevailed for so long is that it originated from his own discipline of astrophysics, which is the default field used to understand the formation of planets and celestial systems.\n\nThe team's paper is a collaboration between physicists and geobiologists, each learning from each other's fields to develop a nuanced picture of how life evolves on a planet like Earth.\n\n\"This paper is the most generous act of interdisciplinary work,\" said Macalady, who also directs Penn State's Astrobiology Research Center. \"Our fields were far apart, and we put them on the same page to get at this question of how we got here and are we alone? There was a gulf, and we built a bridge.\"\n\nThe researchers said they plan to test their alternative model, including questioning the unique status of the proposed evolutionary \"hard steps.\" The recommended research projects are outlined in the current paper and include such work as searching the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system for biosignatures, like the presence of oxygen.\n\nThe team also proposed testing the requirements for proposed \"hard steps\" to determine how hard they actually are by studying uni- and multicellular forms of life under specific environmental conditions such as lower oxygen and temperature levels.\n\nBeyond the proposed projects, the team suggested the research community should investigate whether innovations \u2014such as the origin of life, oxygenic photosynthesis, eukaryotic cells, animal multicellularity and Homo sapiens\u2014are truly singular events in Earth's history. Could similar innovations have evolved independently in the past, but evidence that they happened was lost due to extinction or other factors?\n\n\"This new perspective suggests that the emergence of intelligent life might not be such a long shot after all,\" Wright said.\n\n\"Instead of a series of improbable events, evolution may be more of a predictable process, unfolding as global conditions allow. Our framework applies not only to Earth, but also other planets, increasing the possibility that life similar to ours could exist elsewhere.\"\n\nThe other co-author on the paper is Adam Frank of the University of Rochester.\n\nMore information: Daniel Mills, A reassessment of the \"hard-steps\" model for the evolution of intelligent life, Science Advances (2025).

Our species is made possible because a water-filled planet orbits a particular distance away from a star of a particular size. Before we could evolve, living cells, animals, and primates needed to come first. A fish needed to walk onto land. Considering the many necessary pre-conditions and precursors along our winding path, it can feel accidental, bordering on miraculous, that we exist at all.\n\nFor decades, the \u201chard-steps\u201d model of humanity\u2019s origins has bolstered this idea, suggesting that\u2013given how long it took us to evolve relative to the total timeline of the Sun and Earth\u2013our emergence was deeply improbable. According to the hard-steps model, that extreme implausibility holds true across the universe: The evolution of any human-like intelligent life would be far-fetched on any planet.\n\nBut a new counter theory upends that idea. Intelligent life on Earth and beyond may be much more commonplace than we\u2019d previously thought, according to a paper published February 14 in the journal Science Advances. The qualitative review study offers a detailed critique of the hard-steps model and presents an alternative way of understanding why it took billions of years for our species to evolve. If we were to go extinct, some other form of intelligent life could readily emerge in our stead, according to the newly proposed framework. And humanity is less likely to be alone in the universe than we thought. Though not direct proof of aliens, the theory offers a way forward for testing and studying where, when, and if aliens might exist.\n\n\u201cOur existence is probably not an evolutionary fluke,\u201d says Jennifer Macalady, a study co-author and microbiology professor at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cWe\u2019re an expected or predictable outcome of our planet\u2019s evolution, just as any other intelligent life out there will be.\u201d\n\nThe hard-steps model of evolution\n\nTo understand the new theory, it\u2019s important to first understand the old one. The first version of the hard-steps model was proposed by physicist Brandon Carter in 1983. In basic terms, he looked at the total projected lifespan of the Sun, and noted that humans emerged on Earth in the latter half, with only a few billion years of sunlight and habitability left. He interpreted this to mean that the average time for human-like life to evolve on any given planet is much longer than the habitability window of most planets. And, that the reason humans took so long to arrive is because a certain number of extremely unlikely biological \u201chard-steps\u201d had to occur in sequence to allow it.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

Subsequent scientists built on the model and suggested other possible hard-steps. The new review summarizes these and homes in on the five most commonly cited in past research. These are the origins of life, photosynthesis, eukaryotes, multicellular animals, and humans.\n\nBy hard-steps thinking, each of these five things occurred only once in Earth\u2019s history (according to the current record), required multiple genetic changes in tandem, and is essential to our existence\u2013thus rendering humans the product of large amounts of dumb luck.\n\nA slippery slope to intelligent life\n\nIn contrast, the new model finds alternate explanations for why each of these events appears rare\u2013opening up the possibility that, actually, they\u2019re not inherently unlikely. It describes intelligent life as the result of planetary feedback loops between the geology and biology of Earth, wherein one change made the next probable or even inevitable. The evolution of life happens in tandem with the evolution of our planet, and so they can\u2019t be separated, explains Macalady.\n\nIn short: we may have evolved as soon as Earth\u2019s biosphere made it possible. \u201cWe\u2019re really saying that humans arrived on time, with respect to the evolution of the Earth system,\u201d Macalady says. \u201cAnd some extraterrestrial biospheres might evolve even more rapidly than Earth. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe review paper proposes a few reasons why so-called hard-steps might have been more akin to a ramp. First, Macalady and her co-authors acknowledge that the fossil and genetic records are woefully incomplete and don\u2019t accurately capture everything that\u2019s ever evolved on Earth. Therefore, things that Carter and others assumed only happened once may have actually happened multiple times in our planet\u2019s history.\n\nAs a microbiologist, Macalady notes she\u2019s keenly aware of how common repeats are in evolution. \u201cThere are many more examples of that than examples of hard-steps,\u201d she says. \u201cLife is incredibly innovative and dynamic.\u201d For example, the cellular acquisition of plastids\u2013precursors to the chloroplasts that enable photosynthesis\u2013was long thought to be a singular event in biology. Yet a 2005 study prompted a re-think, indicating that a very similar process had occurred again, more recently in evolutionary time.\n\nOnce an evolutionary innovation becomes established, it might outcompete other similar nodes on the tree of life. Consider that Homo sapiens are the only human species left standing, despite our growing understanding that we originated amid a complex and crowded field.\n\nAny particular biological change can also alter the environment such that it prevents similar changes from happening again. The likelihood of one evolutionary event is not independent of any others, per the new framework. The clearest and most well-studied example of this is photosynthesis, which required a particular chemical setting to evolve. And, by evolving, it fundamentally changed Earth\u2019s atmosphere, eliminating the conditions that first made it possible and pulling up the proverbial ladder.\n\nThis idea: that life on Earth has shaped the Earth itself, is key to the new theory. Intelligent life took billions of years to evolve because the windows in which each requisite step was possible were much smaller than Carter assumed, and didn\u2019t arrive until far later in Earth\u2019s history, says Daniel Mills, the review\u2019s lead author and a geobiologist at the University of Munich. Animals, he notes, were impossible until about 2 billion years into Earth\u2019s lifespan at the earliest, when the first oxygen appeared in the atmosphere. Requirements for long-term human settlement were only met around 400 million years ago, he adds, after 91 percent of Earth\u2019s history had elapsed. \u201cCarter assumed humans could have evolved at any time, but that\u2019s just wrong. For the vast majority of Earth\u2019s history, the planet wasn\u2019t supportive of humans.\u201d\n\nOur emergence wasn\u2019t necessarily a lucky break. Instead, it may have been a given, spurred by a runaway train of planetary conditions and biological events, wherein each car made the next more likely. The study doesn\u2019t prove the possibility, but it does provide a path forward to start testing it.\n\nEvidence of extraterrestrial existence\n\nMacalady and Mills both note that lots of concrete scientific study needs to happen before anyone can confidently say how rare we are in the universe. Ecological observations and lab experiments that verify the pH and temperature requirements of microorganisms could clarify what Earth needed to look like for those lifeforms to first emerge. Deeper dives into ancient proteins and genes could shed light on lost lineages. Advancing geology offers an ever-clearer portrait of ancient environments, and climate modeling can help fill in the gaps.\n\n\n\nOne way we could test which theory is more likely (hard-steps or not-so-hard-steps) is to continue looking beyond our own planet. As we improve our observations of exoplanets, surveying their atmospheres for signs of oxygen might offer a big hint that similar evolutionary trajectories have occurred more than once. The new theory, alone, might prompt additional investment in all of the above, and supercharge the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t, it offers a new way to think about our planet and ourselves. A subset of technocrats like Elon Musk subscribe to the hard-steps theory, notes Mills. It\u2019s a big part of their justification for why humans need to colonize other planets\u2013because we\u2019re potentially the only shot at complex civilization that the universe has. \u201cThat puts a lot of pressure on us,\u201d Mills says.\n\n\n\nYet if we\u2019re not that exceptional, the stakes change. If we go extinct by our own hand or outside circumstance, then another self-aware, technologically advanced society might come next. \u201cI would find that comforting,\u201d says Mills. \u201cI do hope we endure, but I would be happy that the Earth got another chance.\u201d",

            "content": "UPS Velocity warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky. [Photo: UPS Media]\n\nUPS has notified their employees at the Swan Island UPS hub in Portland, Oregon that the temporary closure of the facility, announced earlier this year, will begin effective July 1, 2025, affecting the 600 or so workers currently employed there.\n\nThis follows the discontinuation of the day sort shift in mid-April of last year when over 300 UPS part-timers were laid off by the company, citing a decline in package volume as the main excuse.\n\nCarol Tome, CEO of UPS, has constantly reassured investors that the planned layoffs, a key aspect of their \u201cNetwork of the Future\u201d restructuring plan, had saved UPS more than $1 billion dollars in 2024 alone.\n\nSo far, Teamsters Local 162, which represents the UPS workers affected by the closure, has said nothing in response to this.\n\nHowever, Teamsters International Vice President John Palmer stated the obvious.\n\n\u201cSome of those (jobs) will come back when the building opens up again, but it will be a small percentage,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cLeadership, having seen this coming, should have had a strategy.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the Teamsters union\u2019s strategy from the start has been to help UPS carry out the layoffs. They have been made possible by a new contract pushed through in 2023 under false pretenses, which the bureaucrats hailed as an historic victory after months of insincerely claiming it was prepared to call a nationwide strike.\n\nUPS management plans to close or automate up to 200 facilities nationwide as part of its \u201cNetwork of the Future\u201d program, which executives have said hinges on the \u201clabor certainty\u201d provided by the contract.\n\nTeamsters Local 162 has simply encouraged their members to relocate to another UPS hub in Hillsboro, Oregon, about 25 miles away.\n\nThis repeats the same response that Teamsters Local 396 gave workers when the Grande Vista hub in Vernon, California \u201ctemporarily\u201d closed down in mid-January this year in order to retrofit the hub for automation.\n\nGrande Vista UPS workers were relocated up to 80 miles away to the Inland Empire, (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties) effectively forcing many of the 1,100 members affected by the closure to quit their jobs.\n\nElsewhere, UPS has also announced it is cutting the twilight sorting shifts at the Bedford Park, Franklin Park and Northbrook hubs in Illinois. There, management and the Teamsters have followed the same playbook, with many UPSers losing work hours and increased wages under Market Rate Adjustments (MRA) as a result of their relocation.\n\nAs UPS workers continue to lose their jobs left and right, workers in other industries have faced the same issues of mass layoffs by corporate automation and the inability and refusal of the trade unions to come to their defense.\n\nThese include 18,000 Costco workers, who are also part of the Teamsters union, that had their strike canceled at the last minute with an announcement of a sellout deal.\n\nMuch like their working class brothers and sisters at UPS, they have been intentionally left in the dark in order to ram through this sellout contract as quickly and quietly as possible.\n\nHealthcare workers at Providence Healthcare & Services have been on strike at eight hospitals and several clinics across Oregon since January 10 of this year to fight back against low pay and unsafe patient to staffing ratios.\n\nSo far their union, the Oregon Nurses Association (ONA), have resorted to political stunts at the Oregon state legislature, orienting themselves to the Democrats while doing nothing to rally workers in other industries to their defense.\n\nCity letter carriers, represented by a consortium of pro-corporate union bureaucrats, just rejected a poverty contract brought forward by their own union at the end of January of this year.\n\nThe contract was rejected because it did nothing to remedy the cost of living and inflation or to stop the pro-business \u201cDelivering for America\u201d wrecking operation spearheaded by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.\n\nLastly, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, the third richest person in the world, has closed down all warehouses in Quebec, Canada in response to unsuccessful efforts by Amazon to block unionization efforts from workers.\n\nThe Confederation of National Trade Unions (CNTU), who organized the unionization effort, has responded to the mass firings of over 4,500 workers by filing toothless appeals to the courts and local government officials knowing very well that this will lead to nothing.\n\nAt a time where Gestapo-like ICE raids are taking place in the US\u2014with the support of Teamsters General President Sean O\u2019Brien and other top officials\u2014threaten the democratic rights of workers regardless of their residency status, it is urgent now more than ever for workers to unify across industries and national borders through a rebellion against the corrupt union apparatus.\n\nThe bankrupt orientation of the official trade unions, with the noose of fascism hanging overhead, will lead to catastrophic defeats in the working class eclipsing that of the second world war.\n\nThe UPS Workers Rank-and-File Committee, built to fight against the sellout contract in 2023, must be built as part of the International Workers Alliance of Rank and File Committees.\n\nThese international workplace committees will fight to wrest control of the union out of the hands of the complacent and bankrupt union bureaucracy and place it back into the hands of the rank and file membership on the shop floor.",

(NYSE:UPS) stands against the other large cap dividend growth stocks.\n\nInvestors continue to favor large-cap stocks, as these companies often serve as the foundation of popular index funds and are well-known among both seasoned professionals and casual traders. Moreover, large-cap firms have demonstrated their ability to withstand economic uncertainty, thanks to their strong market presence and substantial cash reserves, which help them weather financial downturns with relative ease. For the second consecutive year in 2024, US large-cap stocks outpaced cash, bonds, and international equities, securing the top spot in market performance.\n\nAlso read:\n\n12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA Morningstar report revealed that over the 10-year period ending June 30, 2024, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks by an average of more than 6 percentage points annually. This disparity stems from differences in sector exposure\u2014small-cap benchmarks have a lower concentration of technology stocks and a greater presence in traditional industries like consumer cyclicals, financials, real estate, and industrials. Although economic growth has been robust, these sectors have struggled to match the pace set by technology-related stocks.\n\nIn addition, according to JPMorgan Wealth Management, large-cap stocks play a key role in driving long-term capital appreciation for investors. Over the 10-year period from 2013 to March 2023, large-cap stocks delivered a total return of 162%, outperforming mid-cap and small-cap stocks, which posted returns of 139% and 108%, respectively.\n\nLarge-cap stocks demonstrate their resilience through their ability to increase dividends even in times of market distress. Several leading companies have maintained decades-long streaks of dividend growth, weathering major economic crises such as the 2008 recession and the 2020 pandemic. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that large-cap firms with a track record of consistent dividend increases have shown relative strength during downturns, suffering smaller losses than the broader market. In addition, these companies have often outperformed during periods of market stagnation and have participated in a substantial share of gains during bull markets.\n\nDividend growth is a key factor when evaluating dividend stocks, as companies that consistently raise their payouts have historically outperformed those that do not. A report by RMB Capital found that between 1972 and 2018, companies that initiated or grew their dividends achieved an average annual return of 9.62%, significantly surpassing the 2.40% return of non-dividend-paying firms. Even the broader market, with a 7.30% return, lagged behind dividend growers. The report also emphasized that companies with a strong history of dividend increases have not only sustained but expanded their payouts, even during economic downturns. From a portfolio perspective, dividend growth stocks provide solid diversification, as they are spread across multiple industries. This offers an advantage over high-yield portfolios, which tend to be concentrated in mature sectors like utilities and, prior to 2007, financials.",

That's the best way to get everything on time,\" she said.\n\nOther advice to get your gifts to where they need to go on time include picking the correct packaging to reduce weight. Envelopes can sometimes be less expensive than boxes.\n\nAlso consider printing two copies of the label. One for the outside \u2014 just in case something happens to the package \u2014 and another for the inside as a backup.\n\nHerm\u00e8s and the success of the coveted Birkin bag | 60 Minutes\n\nSchool shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, police say\n\nFake nudes created by AI \"nudify\" sites are causing real harm, victims say | 60 Minutes",

            "content": "UPS has added a new route between Paris (CDG) and Hong Kong (HKG) to meet expanding export demand from French businesses.\n\nThe cargo carrier will operate flights five times a week to support French exports of wine and other food products to Hong Kong and Asia. This business accounts for over 20% of its market.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong is home to large consumer bases in the high fashion, food and drink, and aerospace sectors. It is also the location of expanding dental and pharmaceutical outsourcing markets.\n\nThere is now greater demand for complex pharma treatments, including dental care supported by customised implants, fillings, enamels, and materials, which has aided growth in the French dental market.\n\nTo quickly meet the needs of their customers, French dental companies with and without domestic capacity are increasingly looking abroad to outsourcing markets like Hong Kong which have well developed dental laboratories and manufacturing hubs to provide support, said UPS.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s luxury fashion market is also projected to grow, with Euromonitor expecting Hong Kong to maintain its lead as the location with the highest per capita spending on luxury goods until 2028.\n\nMichiel van Veen, cluster manager, Benelux and France at UPS, said: \u201cWith this new flight path, we can provide French businesses of all sizes and industries the fast and reliable service they need to grow and stay competitive.\n\n\u201cShipping preferences play an increasing part in a consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. Thanks to our investments we can make logistics a competitive advantage, offering unmatched choice, convenience, and control.\u201d\n\nUPS reported a 1.5% year-on-year increase in fourth-quarter revenues to $25.3bn, while operating profit improved by 18.1% to $2.9bn and net income was up 7.2% to $1.7bn.\n\nHowever, for the full year, revenues were up just 0.1% to $91.1bn, operating profit was down 7.4% to $8.5bn and net income declined 13.8% to $5.8bn.\n\nUPS has also revealed plans to offload 50% of its business with its largest customer Amazon.",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Why These 10 Dividend Stocks Are Declining? In this article, we are going to take a look at where United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nIn this article, we will examine 10 companies with high dividend yields and explore the reasons behind declining stock prices.\n\nCompanies that pay dividends have been a reliable choice for investors seeking a passive and somewhat stable income. All the stocks in our list today have offered attractive yields, thus satisfying the expectations of these investors. But we have noticed them struggling in recent months.\n\nBroader market conditions, like a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imported into the US, have led to market volatility. Though the broader market remained unchanged, the Nasdaq composite faced a decline during the past few weeks. These changes are reflected in the price of many high dividend-paying stocks. Some companies are additionally experiencing company-specific challenges. The strategic transition of British Petroleum from oil and gas assets to green energy and divestment, for instance, has led to its underperformance. Comparatively, competitors who were focused on fossil fuels gained preference, owing to the analysts questioning the future dividend sustainability of BP. The shifting investor sentiment also has contributed to the downturn of some of the stocks in our list.\n\nWe find it difficult to point out any single sector as a worst-performing sector. The recent macroeconomic trends, inclusive of the inflationary pressures as well as the interest rate adjustments, cause ripples across multiple sectors in the US economy. Some companies have maintained stable payouts proportionately to an increase in their share value. Others face declining share prices because of weaker earnings and reduced interests among the hedge fund holders.\n\nDividend Aristocrats have historically provided stability and consistent income. They have been a popular choice among long-term investors. In the past few months, however, the stock prices of these companies have declined despite maintaining high dividend yields. The upward interest rates and inflation rates recently pressured some high-yield companies, making it hard for them to sustain dividend increases without debts. Thus, high yields may seem appealing, but it falls in the hands of the investors to assess the ability of these companies to maintain their payouts without jeopardizing financial health.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nThe article includes 10 high-yield dividend stocks experiencing a decline in their prices in the last 1 month. Each company on the list was added after ensuring that they have a market capitalization of over $1 billion and a minimum dividend yield of 2.5%. The article assessed financial sustainability using historical stock performance, dividend payout ratios, and earnings reports. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024. The final list is ranked according to their dividend yields, as of February 11.",

            "content": "Last year, Jack Taylor\u2019s classmates at Preston Middle School used to stand in a circle between classes, heads down, and text each other. This year, with cell phones tucked away from the first bell until dismissal, more conversations are happening face-to-face.\n\n\u201cI feel like kids are more interactive in class and raise their hands more. Last year, they would just stare at their phones,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTaylor didn\u2019t have a phone until this school year, which he said he never uses, even outside of school. One of his eighth-grade classmates, Lily Pickett, said she was an avid phone user last year, but enforcement of the district\u2019s cell phone policy has helped her cut back on screen time and pay more attention in daily conversations.\n\n\u201cI used to be on my phone 24/7,\u201d Pickett said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become more social with everyone. Communication has gotten a lot better\u201d throughout the school.\n\nAcross PSD, all elementary and middle school students are expected to store cell phones, earbuds, and other electronic accessories out of sight and set to silent throughout the school day, including passing periods, lunch, and class. Although the district cell phone policy language hasn\u2019t changed, enforcement of the policy became more uniform in 2024-25. Previously, schools varied in how they implemented the policy \u2013 some allowed students to have or use their phones in the classroom or between class periods.\n\n\u201cWhat was lacking before was consistency,\u201d said Bill Saint, an assistant principal at Preston.\n\nIt would have been a big deal to take a student\u2019s cell phone away last year and keep it in the office until school let out, according to Saint.\n\n\u201cSince we are all now using the same messaging, it has really been a non-issue,\u201d he said.\n\nAs with any new behavior, greater enforcement of the cell phone policy took some getting used to. First offenses can lead to a warning or having to drop a phone off at the office for the rest of the day. If phone use at school is an ongoing issue, school administrators develop a plan with a student\u2019s parents or guardians to determine a solution, which may include leaving a phone at home or keeping it in the office throughout the school day.\n\nThe policy has exceptions for students with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or a Section 504 Plan that requires use of a device or accessories, such as headphones, and schools can grant permission for a student to use a phone in a designated area in an emergency. Students and families can also connect over a school landline.\n\nWebber Middle School Principal Bryan Davis said he wasn\u2019t sure what to expect this year, but there has been no parental pushback and very little pushback from students to the cell phone policy at his school. Some students still take out their phones from time to time, but Davis said this has become less common throughout the year. His recommendation to schools considering enforcing a bell-to-bell phone-free policy is to drop the fear of the unknown and just do it.\n\n\u201cClassrooms are where I see the biggest difference,\u201d Davis said. \u201cStudents\u2019 heads are up, they\u2019re engaged with the teacher, they\u2019re engaged in small group discussion.\u201d\n\nSaint has seen a positive change in his school as well, saying the policy has been empowering for parents and teachers and beneficial for students.\n\n\u201cOur culture is better for it,\" he said.",

It felt like the perfect opportunity to reflect on the state of modern romance and why events like Speed Dating might be exactly what we need to turn things around.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: dating today is a whole different ballgame. Once upon a time, people met at the local diner, through mutual friends, or just by bumping into someone at the grocery store. Now? Meeting someone in the wild has become almost mythical. We\u2019re more likely to swipe right on a stranger\u2019s carefully curated profile than strike up a conversation at a bar. And even when we do, there\u2019s that lingering question: \u201cAre they even single?\u201d\n\nOnline dating apps were supposed to make things easier, and in some ways, they have. The convenience of swiping while binge-watching your favorite show is undeniable. But this ease has come at a cost. Apps have turned people into commodities, shifting the focus from genuine connections to collecting matches. The endless options create a paradox of choice, leaving many of us searching for something better instead of appreciating what\u2019s right in front of us.\n\nThen there are the dating groups and forums. Once a space for advice and encouragement, they\u2019ve become battlefields of horror stories and over-analysis. Posts dissecting minor interactions \u2013 \u201cWhy did they only text me once today?\u201d or \u201cIs it a red flag if they\u2019re still friends with their ex?\u201d \u2013 only fuel confusion and paranoia. While these spaces foster camaraderie, they\u2019ve also normalized overthinking and, in some cases, unrealistic expectations.\n\nsignup Get notified about future editions: * Select list(s) to subscribe to POL Newsletter Example: Yes, I would like to receive emails from Princeton Perspectives.

Places like River Horse Brewing Co., with its lively atmosphere and welcoming vibe, are perfect for sparking conversations. But even in these ideal settings, the challenge remains. In a world dominated by smartphones, people are often too absorbed in their digital lives to notice potential connections right in front of them.\n\nThis is where events like Speed Dating come in. They provide a structured environment where people can step away from their screens and engage in face-to-face conversations. There\u2019s something refreshing about sitting across from someone and having a real, unfiltered interaction. It\u2019s an opportunity to break down the walls we\u2019ve built and rediscover the art of connection.\n\nAfter endless dead ends, trying to meet people in all kinds of settings, they rarely led to anything more than small talk. Even grocery store aisle conversations didn\u2019t spark the kind of connection I was looking for. So, deciding to host a Speed Dating night at River Horse Brewing Co. was an easy choice. Breweries foster a relaxed and welcoming environment where people can connect effortlessly. The casual atmosphere, filled with the buzz of conversation, helps take the pressure off first impressions. With an easygoing setting, plenty of opportunities for laughter, and a little liquid courage, guests can focus on genuine connections, making it an enjoyable and memorable way to meet new people. Breweries are natural community hubs, bringing people together through a shared appreciation for craft beer and good company. River Horse Brewing Co. is always looking for ways to strengthen community ties, and this was another opportunity to do that.\n\nOf course, the idea of Speed Dating might seem outdated or even a little awkward at first. But isn\u2019t that part of the charm? In a time when so much of our lives are carefully filtered, the authenticity of a Speed Dating event is a welcome change. As my single friends like to say, \u2018At least I\u2019ll know they\u2019re real and looking for the same thing, as well as not just someone who ghosts after three messages!\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve had my fair share of dating mishaps. These experiences have taught me about resilience, humor, and the importance of knowing what I want in a partner. They\u2019ve also made me realize that, despite the frustrations, there\u2019s something inherently hopeful about putting yourself out there. Every bad date is a step closer to finding the right one\u2014or at the very least, a good story to tell your friends.\n\nFrom awkward singles mixers to forced group activities, I\u2019ve tried numerous in-person dating events. While some felt like uncomfortable set-ups and others just turned into friend meetups, they all reinforced one thing\u2014meeting people face-to-face still holds value. That is why the Speed Dating event with River Horse Brewing Co. feels like a small but meaningful way to combat the struggles of modern dating. It\u2019s a chance to create an environment where people can connect without the pressure of algorithms or the noise of online commentary. It\u2019s about bringing people back to the basics\u2014sharing a laugh, exchanging stories, and maybe, just maybe, finding a spark.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re single and tired of the dating app grind, I encourage you to give Speed Dating a try. At the very least, it\u2019s a fun night out with great company, craft beer, and the chance to step outside your comfort zone\u2014because let\u2019s be honest, love isn\u2019t going to find you while you\u2019re doom-scrolling at home. Even if you don\u2019t walk away with a love connection, you might leave with a renewed sense of hope and a few new friends. And who knows? Maybe the person sitting across from you at River Horse Brewing Co. will be the one who makes you believe in meeting people in the wild again.\n\nGabrielle Rosenblum-Zampella is the founder of The Central Gab, a platform dedicated to supporting small New Jersey based businesses through marketing, social media, and curated events.

Uncover the pivotal $45 million penalty and why the LTL division sale set a new benchmark for regulatory oversight.\n\nThe UPS SEC Settlement has become a defining moment in logistics and financial reporting, shining a spotlight on alleged overvaluation and delayed goodwill impairment. At the heart of this matter is UPS Freight\u2014previously the parcel carrier\u2019s less-than-truckload (LTL) unit\u2014sold to TFI International for $800 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged UPS with repeatedly overlooking its own internal analysis, ultimately leading to a $45 million penalty. Below, we explore the key events, examine industry comparisons , and offer practical takeaways on how to maintain compliance with financial reporting guidelines without burdening readers with unnecessary complexity.\n\nFor additional company updates and insights on the parcel giant, visit our dedicated UPS coverage.\n\nUnderstanding the UPS SEC Settlement\n\nThe UPS SEC Settlement centers on claims that United Parcel Service overvalued its LTL division before finalizing the sale to TFI International. Investigators found that while UPS possessed internal estimates pegging the unit\u2019s value at around $650 million, it sought and relied on third-party valuations that placed the figure closer to $2 billion. As a result, UPS allegedly delayed acknowledging a $500 million goodwill impairment, which should have been recognized earlier under GAAP compliance issues.\n\nSponsorship\n\n\n\n\u201cThe final $45 million penalty, while neither admitted nor denied by UPS, underscores the agency\u2019s stance on the seriousness of such oversights in financial reporting guidelines.\u201d\n\nEnjoying our insights? Subscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest industry trends and developments. Stay Informed\n\nThis discrepancy between internal and external valuations formed the basis of the SEC\u2019s contention that UPS materially overstated the unit\u2019s earnings and misled investors. Observers also note that TFI International, which ultimately purchased UPS Freight, has not pursued further legal action or indicated plans to seek redress, though questions remain about the role overvaluation might have played in the final acquisition price.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to explore enforcement actions and corporate oversight, check out our latest SEC-related news.\n\nTimeline Snapshot: Key Milestones\n\nEarly Internal Analysis (2019): UPS identifies a potential goodwill impairment of nearly $500 million for its LTL division.\n\nUPS identifies a potential goodwill impairment of nearly $500 million for its LTL division.

Internal reports indicated that its performance and growth trajectory were not aligned with the parcel carrier\u2019s core strategies. However, the external valuation process reportedly used assumptions a genuine buyer was unlikely to adopt, boosting the unit\u2019s estimated worth to around $2 billion.\n\nAccording to the Securities and Exchange Commission, this method obscured the need for timely goodwill impairment. Regulators contended that the company\u2019s public filings did not accurately reflect the Freight unit\u2019s declining outlook, complicating the assessment of earnings misrepresentation and breaching financial reporting guidelines.\n\nFor deeper insights into less-than-truckload operations, discover more on the LTL sector here.\n\nIndustry Comparisons: Goodwill Impairment in Logistics\n\nThe UPS SEC Settlement invites comparisons with how other logistics and parcel carriers handle goodwill valuations:\n\nFedEx has historically been proactive in signaling any underperformance within its divisions, recording impairments when e-commerce shifts or macroeconomic factors create sustained downturns.\n\nhas historically been proactive in signaling any underperformance within its divisions, recording impairments when e-commerce shifts or macroeconomic factors create sustained downturns. XPO Logistics previously adjusted the carrying values of certain business segments following acquisitions, emphasizing detailed internal assessments to drive timely disclosures.\n\nAcross the industry, timely and realistic impairment tests are crucial. Overlooking early warning signs\u2014whether due to optimism or inadequate internal checks\u2014can lead to accounting misstatements, regulatory oversight, and reputational harm. The UPS case highlights that even top-tier carriers are not immune to GAAP compliance issues and calls for stronger oversight of intangible assets.\n\nTo understand strategic business moves in logistics, read about recent divestitures across the industry.\n\nWhy Did the SEC Impose a $45 Million Penalty?\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission scrutinized not just the numerical discrepancy in UPS Freight\u2019s valuation, but also the sequence of events that delayed an accurate goodwill impairment. Factors influencing the penalty include:\n\nIgnoring Internal Analyses: UPS failed to give proper weight to its own calculations indicating a significantly lower LTL division valuation.\n\nUPS failed to give proper weight to its own calculations indicating a significantly lower LTL division valuation.

Many industry analysts point out that the SEC\u2019s action reflects a low tolerance for overlooking clear signs of diminished asset value. Some experts frame UPS\u2019s reliance on overly optimistic valuations, while disregarding internal warnings, as an example of how earnings misstatements can unfold when management priorities clash with accounting realities. Meanwhile, certain observers suggest the settlement establishes a precedent, prompting tighter scrutiny of intangible assets across the logistics sector.\n\nFinancial governance specialists note that the $45 million penalty\u2014though relatively small compared to UPS\u2019s market capitalization\u2014carries significant symbolic weight. It signals that even non-cash accounting oversights, such as late goodwill write-downs, can lead to notable regulatory actions. Investors and compliance professionals alike see this case as reinforcing the need for robust internal checks and open communication of potential losses, both critical for safeguarding market confidence and compliance.\n\nFor a broader perspective on the ever-evolving regulatory environment in transportation, explore our coverage of regulations here.\n\nImpact on Future Acquisitions and Valuation Scrutiny\n\nThe settlement\u2019s outcome carries broad implications for M&A activities within transportation and logistics. Dealmakers may adopt more conservative strategies around purchase price allocations and goodwill, especially if an acquisition target appears to have limited growth or uncertain synergy opportunities. Auditors and boards are expected to demand thorough justifications for post-acquisition valuations, ensuring that any goodwill recorded is tested more frequently for possible impairment.\n\nSome industry insiders believe that UPS\u2019s experience could encourage corporate leaders to conduct interim impairment reviews soon after sizeable transactions, rather than waiting for the annual test. The central aim is to recognize\u2014and disclose\u2014any potential asset value declines swiftly, thus avoiding prolonged periods of inflated valuations. By illustrating the regulatory risks linked to delayed write-downs, the UPS SEC Settlement may deter companies from hesitating on impairments, highlighting the need for more frequent financial evaluations following acquisitions.\n\nTo look into proven methods for maintaining operational standards, check out our compliance best practices.\n\nRegulatory Trends in Goodwill and Disclosures\n\nUPS\u2019s settlement reflects a growing trend of SEC enforcement around goodwill. Regulators have become more proactive in calling out firms that stall on recording impairment, stressing the damage such delays can inflict on investor trust. Across multiple industries, the SEC has pursued cases against companies that ignored clear evidence their goodwill was inflated.\n\nWithin this heightened landscape, transportation companies are no exception. Observers note the sector\u2019s asset-heavy and acquisitive nature may trigger closer regulatory attention. The SEC\u2019s stance highlights its belief that accurate, prompt financial disclosures underpin investor protection. Consequently, businesses with substantial goodwill must be prepared to defend the assumptions behind their impairment tests, ensuring management does not override unfavorable findings.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about legal disputes impacting the industry, discover our latest litigation insights.\n\nUPS\u2019s Post-Settlement Governance and Compliance Measures\n\nFollowing the settlement, UPS launched new training initiatives and enhanced oversight, aiming to prevent a similar lapse in accounting accuracy. According to company statements, an independent compliance consultant will evaluate UPS\u2019s impairment-testing procedures, fair value calculations, and disclosure protocols to propose any needed improvements. Meanwhile, the firm\u2019s audit committee is poised to deepen its involvement in confirming that internal valuation analyses align with real-time market factors.\n\nAlthough UPS has already divested its Freight unit, these measures help reassure shareholders, regulators, and the public that the company has learned from the SEC\u2019s findings. By strengthening its internal controls and emphasizing precise goodwill assessments, UPS demonstrates its dedication to transparency. The lesson is clear: even a well-established market leader faces notable repercussions when internal data indicating asset devaluation is overshadowed by optimistic external valuations or reporting delays.\n\nFAQ: Common Questions on the UPS SEC Settlement\n\nQ1: Why is goodwill impairment so important in the logistics industry?\n\nGoodwill can represent a significant portion of a company\u2019s value, especially after acquisitions. In freight and parcel operations, accurately measuring performance helps ensure that balance sheets reflect real conditions and that investors understand a division\u2019s health.\n\nQ2: Did TFI International overpay for UPS Freight?\n\nAlthough the sale price was $800 million, UPS\u2019s internal valuations suggested an even lower figure. TFI International\u2019s CEO has declined to comment on whether the alleged overvaluation affected the final purchase price.\n\nQ3: What steps must UPS take post-settlement?\n\nAs part of the UPS SEC Settlement, the carrier agreed to cease and desist from future violations, enhance training programs, and refine internal processes for more reliable goodwill testing and disclosure.\n\nTo stay informed on common infractions within freight and transportation, find additional cases of reported violations here.\n\nKey Takeaways on the UPS SEC Settlement\n\nRefined Oversight: UPS now faces stricter regulatory oversight and must reinforce its financial controls.\n\nUPS now faces stricter regulatory oversight and must reinforce its financial controls.

            "content": "European NATO countries are shifting their defense priorities and rearming to meet new threats on European borders and increase defense spending. To achieve these objectives, they are discussing three key areas: replenishing and expanding stocks of weapons systems and munitions, improving mission readiness by increasing the availability of existing weapons systems, and developing new capabilities to stay at the forefront of technology as battlefield lessons emerge and opportunities arise\u2014sparked by innovation.\n\nAbout the authors This article is a collaborative effort by David Chinn and Jakob St\u00f6ber, with Hannes Fischer, Jessica K\u00f6hler, Katharina Wagner, and Nadine Grie\u00dfmann, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Aerospace & Defense Practice.\n\nWhile European governments will likely seek to focus their existing defense industrial base around the first two priorities, new industrial options\u2014including start-ups and private capital funding\u2014could play a major role in the third area of maintaining an edge in technology. An expert on the topic who we recently interviewed suggested that a balanced approach that incorporates both the agility of start-ups and the established capabilities of traditional defense players could be essential as countries increase spending to meet defense needs.\n\nOur methodology We examined the European defense technology landscape, drawing from multiple sources, including a proprietary McKinsey database with more than 130 European start-ups, supplemented by PitchBook data and McKinsey\u2019s internal knowledge. Additionally, we conducted a survey among investors and start-ups, complemented by in-depth interviews with start-up leaders and venture capitalists. This comprehensive data collection formed a robust foundation for analyzing the current state of the European defense tech ecosystem, including technological focus areas, the number of start-ups, sources of funding, and identifying key areas for improvement.\n\nIn this article, we explore the current state of the European defense technology landscape and how start-ups can help boost innovative solutions for countries\u2019 defense readiness and resilience (see sidebar, \u201cOur methodology\u201d).\n\nLearning from the US ecosystem\n\nThe future battlefield could look very different: Technological advancements from the civilian commercial world\u2014including satellite constellations, first-person view (FPV) drones, and AI\u2014are rapidly being adopted by military forces. Geopolitical instability, particularly the war in Ukraine, has accelerated this trend. However, military leaders of European NATO countries are facing challenges in adopting these new technologies, including those already successfully deployed in Ukraine, and building new capabilities.\n\nAs we have written before, start-ups and investors are actively seeking to meet these needs\u2014both in Europe and the United States. But as the data in Exhibit 1 show, the emerging European defense tech start-up ecosystem is about five years behind the United States\u2019 in terms of maturity. European nations can learn from the United States\u2019 experience and accelerate their own start-up ecosystem to improve the development of innovative defense capabilities.\n\nWe analyzed the European tech start-up funding environment to determine how it differs from the United States and what could accelerate its development. Four themes emerged:\n\nDiffering levels of maturity. The United States has a more mature defense start-up environment, which is reflected in the volume of capital deployed, the age of the more mature and scaled companies, as well as the number of completed funding rounds (two to four times more rounds in the United States than in Europe) (Exhibit 1). This is largely due to the deeper venture markets in the United States, which are benefiting from the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), which\u2014ten years after inception\u2014is awarding larger, nine-digit contracts today, stimulating further investment and scale. Unlike in Europe, an increasing number of US companies, such as Anduril and Palantir, have emerged as significant global players and are even beginning to act as primes or form consortiums independent of established players. Additionally, talent with expertise from more established defense tech players in the United States have left those companies and founded new US start-ups, further boosting the ecosystem. In addition, the environment in which European and US start-ups are developing differs greatly. European start-ups\u2019 geographical proximity to the war in Ukraine has accelerated their development\u2014from idea to deployment with accelerated learning due to battlefield lessons\u2014which could enable European defense start-ups to close the gap to their US peers or even emerge as the innovation leader in some technology areas.\n\nA significant increase in funding. Our analysis shows that investment into European defense tech start-ups has increased by over 500 percent in the 2021 to 2024 period compared to the preceding three years. The number of venture capital (VC) investors is growing, too, highlighting the expansion of the ecosystem. These include defense-focused investors, for instance, D3, Decisive Point, and Tholus Capital; more generalist investors such as Lakestar; and corporate VC funds; as well as public funds (for example, the NATO Innovation Fund) and national initiatives such as Ukraine\u2019s Brave1.\n\nA gap in European capital for later-stage rounds. On the whole, European deep-tech start-ups struggle to secure late-stage funding from domestic investors, with the share of capital from Asian and United States\u2019 investors rising to nearly 50 percent at these stages. This trend is mirrored in the defense tech sector, where the growth in early-stage funding described above is not mirrored in later stages. Here, US investors dominate larger, later-stage rounds, providing more than 60 percent of the capital in funding rounds exceeding $200 million (Exhibit 2). This is supported by our survey data, which confirms that a significant percentage of start-ups find it easier to secure large-scale funding from US investors than European ones. And despite the existence of European defense innovation structures, limited budgets often prevent start-ups from securing large-scale contracts that are essential for their growth.\n\nCrowning the winners with capital. When examining the funding dynamics in Europe, our analysis reveals that each application category is dominated by a single, large start-up, which often receives more than 50 percent of all funding in a category (Exhibit 3). This phenomenon is not unique to Europe (where, for example, Helsing, an AI-focused defense tech unicorn, has achieved remarkable prominence) ; it is also observed in the United States, where companies such as Anduril, Epirus, and Saronic lead their respective sectors in terms of funding that they have attracted.\n\nIn interviews, investors expressed a clear preference for identifying and supporting these leading companies early on, effectively seeking to \u201ccrown the winners with capital.\u201d Moreover, the specific dynamics of the defense market, especially customers\u2019 understandable focus on reliability and trustworthiness, may contribute to this pattern: Once a start-up has earned the trust of end users and the procurement agency, these established relationships can serve as a competitive advantage, effectively creating a barrier to entry for potential competitors.\n\nNevertheless, the defense tech start-up ecosystem is still young, even in the United States. With a typical life cycle of ten to 15 years for the maturation of VC-funded companies and very few start-ups more than five years old, the evolution of the sector is far from clear.\n\nBoosting the European defense tech start-up ecosystem\n\nTo further unlock the potential of European defense tech start-ups and accelerate the growth of the ecosystem, stakeholders could consider decisive action in various areas. The order of these actions does not reflect their prioritization or importance.\n\n1. Shift public perception to attract potential founders to defense-related challenges\n\nDespite their growth, European defense tech start-ups still only accounted for 1.8 percent of Europe\u2019s VC funding in 2024. Many potential deep-tech founders and start-up employees view dual-use or military cases as \u201coff limits,\u201d hindering company formation and shrinking the available talent pool. Shifting public perception to view defense as central to Europe\u2019s security and resilience could help attract more founders. Public institutions could consider how to address the explicit and implicit constraints which are inhibiting research with military relevance and funding for such research. This could help to increase the body of research available for industrialization and signal public support to researchers for these efforts.\n\nInvestors may consider inspiring potential founders by publicizing start-up success cases that highlight the link between purpose, prosperity, and strengthening the defense capabilities of European NATO countries. They could also seek to encourage military veterans to become founders, who could bring their experience to launch defense tech companies.\n\nMilitary reserve programs could be a way to make the roles of the armed forces more accessible to civilians (and for them to understand the challenges). This could also be done through what is being referred to as \u201ctotal defense\u201d approaches, modeled after practices in Scandinavian countries such as Sweden. Governments and industry leaders could strengthen support systems for founders by establishing and funding accelerators and incubators with dedicated defense tech programs.\n\n2. Adapt the incentive system to attract funders to defense-related businesses\n\nMany start-ups struggle to secure VC and growth investment due to regulatory requirements and limited pools of potential capital. For example, limited partner investors\u2014both public and private\u2014often prohibit investments in lethal or purely military technologies. By addressing the challenges that cause these investment constraints, available capital could be expanded, and the ecosystem growth could be accelerated. The issue of insufficient capital is twofold, involving both private and public capital. Potential measures include:\n\nFor private capital:\n\nWhile investors are changing their policy statements, some governments and the European Union are already discussing the scope of the official definitions of environmental, societal, and governance (ESG) criteria and adapting them to explicitly include defense and dual-use technologies. These changes could also support start-ups in building and maintaining relationships with banks.\n\nGovernments could explore capital attraction tools, such as tax incentives, as a way to motivate private investors to allocate more resources to later-stage start-ups.\n\nPrivate investors could revisit limited partnership (LP) agreements to remove restrictions or consider establishing subfund structures that cater to the needs of different LPs rather than adopting the most restrictive common denominator. This would allow investors who are navigating regulatory constraints, such as pension funds and insurance companies, to participate in various dual-use investments and more flexibly adjust their stance as guardrails change.\n\nFor public capital:\n\nNational and multilateral institutions could adapt the requirements for public funding vehicles\u2014such as the European Investment Fund (EIF) and European sovereign wealth funds\u2014to allow a broader range of defense investments.\n\nGovernments could make investment in defense VC funds more attractive by providing nondilutive capital to defense start-ups and offering low-cost leverage to VCs, similar to the approach taken by the Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) in the United States.\n\n3. Adapt procurement mechanisms to access innovative solutions from a wider supply base\n\nThe government procurement processes associated with defense programs can be complicated, country-specific, and administration-heavy, placing high costs, lengthy procedures, and hard-to-meet requirements on young companies that lack the resources and experience to navigate such processes. Current European procurement systems often operate on very long cycles, which can be incompatible with the fast-paced, iterative nature of venture-backed innovation. To work effectively with start-ups, a significant cultural shift toward more agile procurement processes is needed.\n\nMultiple start-ups have raised concerns about \u201cinnovation theater\u201d that captures public attention without allocating resources at the scale required to achieve significant revenue growth. In addition, the fragmented procurement environment in Europe is a significant disadvantage for defense start-ups compared to the unified US market, as the start-ups have to deal with individual nations sourcing from domestic, regional, and global suppliers, with additional requirements to meet different regulations in each country.\n\nMeasures can be taken by procurement agencies, governments, and end users to address these challenges and build a robust European defense ecosystem. These could include procurement agencies establishing dedicated innovation units with their own contracting staff, similar to, for example, the DIU, to speed up access to innovative solutions and support start-ups to meet growing demand.\n\nIn addition, governments could ensure that their budgets allow for evolution from prototype to larger-scale purchases with visible pathways. Investors are clear that this is essential for start-ups to raise capital beyond progress in achieving procurement stage gates.\n\n4. Strengthen collaboration between start-ups and primes\n\nBoth start-ups and primes have pointed out potential concerns about working with each other. Start-ups have described issues with funding delays, restrictive exclusivity agreements, and the way that primes can treat start-ups as subcontractors rather than innovation partners. Conversely, primes mention different ways of working, their need to adhere to more stringent obligations (for example, on risk management), and adequate resourcing for long-term programs as sources of tension. However, there are ways that the value of partnerships could be emphasized to boost support for defense innovation.\n\nTailored operating models for innovation partnerships could be developed by primes (instead of standard program consortiums), as well as alternative commercial models that grow the strengths of and provide mutual benefits to all parties involved. An example could be to streamline investment processes, enabling quicker decision-making on funding or contract opportunities for start-ups. The choice of operating model becomes particularly relevant when primes collaborate with more mature start-ups. A conscious decision must be made about which engagement model to use, which requires a thorough understanding of their own technology competencies and their ability to outperform their tech peers in innovation.\n\nGovernments could act, too, by considering putting requirements in place for the use of commercial and dual-use technologies in program tenders. They could also encourage primes to include innovators in their supply chains, for instance, by adapting criteria in their supplier selection processes.\n\nStart-ups are able to take action by thinking about incorporating \u201cprime collaboration\u201d as an explicit part of their capability profile, for example. This could be done by hiring talent that understands the dynamics of working with larger industry players and that can navigate the complexities of these relationships.\n\n5. Enable iterative development of solutions with end users\n\nStart-ups\u2019 core value proposition lies in their ability to move quickly, fund their own R&D, and develop solutions in close collaboration with end users. Currently, this rapid, iterative development can be constrained by the challenges young start-ups encounter when trying to access military end-user feedback and data. While the military\u2019s stringent standards on quality, reliability, and access to classified information are in place for good reasons and need to be adhered to, finding ways to ease collaboration between start-ups and end users is likely to enable better solutions aligned with practical needs and operational realities.\n\nTo address these issues, private capital providers could utilize innovation hubs and defense technology foundries to enable real-time codevelopment and refine solutions with end users\u2014demonstrated by the Cyber Innovation Hub of the German armed forces. These could also allow for closer connections between industry players, start-ups, and Ministry of Defense (MoD) end users. Meanwhile, public capital providers (government agencies or state-owned VC funds) could consider adopting elements of successful US vehicles, such as the DIU or In-Q-Tel. For instance, In-Q-Tel provides start-ups with capital while supporting them in building strong customer and user relationships and adhering to customers\u2019 standards for protecting classified data. And, last, investors, MoDs, and armed forces could offer low-threshold formats to connect military customers, end users, and innovators (such as workshops, hackathons, and networking events).\n\nThe European defense tech start-up ecosystem is expanding as countries pursue innovative solutions to enhance their defense capabilities in response to geopolitical challenges. While progress has been made, it is crucial to address funding gaps, attract talent, and streamline procurement processes to boost the ecosystem. Collaboration between government customers, capital providers, and entrepreneurs will be vital in driving this transformation. Going forward, synergy between start-ups and established defense players could unlock unprecedented opportunities, ensuring that Europe stays at the forefront of defense innovation and resilience.",

This is thanks to regulators who recognize the contradiction of, on the one hand, utility customers subsidizing the proliferation of carbon-intensive gas infrastructure and use, and on the other, utilities\u2019 obligations to reduce their carbon emissions over time\u2014to say nothing of the general need to protect customers from the high costs of future stranded assets and bloated energy bills.1\n\nOn January 1, 2025, two Washington state utilities, Avista and Puget Sound Energy (PSE), fully eliminated costly line extension allowances\u2014a first in Cascadia. And Oregon regulators have put Avista and NW Natural on a schedule to ratchet down their allowances annually and ultimately eliminate them in 2027. Similar phaseouts are in the works for Cascade Natural Gas\u2019s gas infrastructure subsidies in both Oregon and Washington.\n\nStill, regulators have not yet done away with the line extension allowances offered by the 11 other gas utilities across Cascadia, including three in Oregon and Washington. And as more customers every year choose to reduce their gas use or go fully electric, for financial or health or climate reasons, they\u2019re leaving a shrinking number of customers on the hook for paying off those gas pipe extensions over time. Plus, new evidence suggests gas utilities that are getting rid of line extension allowances may have overcharged customers already, on the order of millions of dollars in excess of allowed amounts.\n\nRegulators across the region can do away with these costly subsidies to obsolescing fossil fuel-based systems once and for all (something California regulators did in 2023). And they can do one better by investigating utilities\u2019 possible overcharges to customers to fund these subsidies.\n\nThe old logic: Endless gas expansion, funded by ratepayers\n\nLine extension allowances, as Sightline wrote about in 2023, were once a good deal for both new and existing gas customers\u2014that is, before the world learned of the incontrovertible evidence about the climate and health hazards of burning gas in homes. Without the subsidies, a developer or homeowner could expect to pay thousands of dollars to connect their building to a gas distribution pipeline. So, regulators allowed utilities to subsidize the cost of installing new gas service lines, a cost utilities then recouped by adding them to their \u201crate base.\u201d2\n\nFinancing these subsidies though a rate base works like a home mortgage. Every month ratepayers pay back to the utility some of the original investment plus an interest charge (i.e., profit for the utility). Once the investment is fully paid off (say, in 50 or 60 years for a gas service line), the amount ratepayers have paid is many times the original subsidy amount. In Oregon and Washington, the total cost of line extension allowances over the depreciation life can be four to ten times the initial subsidy price.3\n\n\u201cGas utilities in Oregon and Washington will charge customers more than $570 million for gas pipes added in 2022-23, when accounting for the full cost of those pipes over their entire book life, according to Sightline estimates.\u201d In Oregon and Washington, utilities will roll into the rates they charge their customers roughly $91 million in costs for gas line extension allowance offered in 2022-23 alone. Sightline estimates that figure balloons to more than $570 million over the new pipelines\u2019 \u201cbook life\u201d when accounting for utility profits, taxes, and operational and maintenance expenses.4,5 In British Columbia, FortisBC padded its rate base with an estimated C$139 million in line extension allowances in 2022\u201323, which will cost British Columbians more than C$1.5 billion over the 60-year book life of these assets.6 Historically, existing customers of a utility benefited from this arrangement, even though they were footing the bill for the subsidy. That\u2019s because more total gas customers meant further spreading out the costs of maintaining expensive pipeline infrastructure, which lowered everyone\u2019s bills. But as Cascadians opt for reliable electric appliances like heat pumps for heating and cooling and induction stoves for healthier indoor air while cooking, the economic logic behind line extension allowances crumbles.\n\nAs more people opt for electric appliances, subsidizing gas expansion makes less sense\n\nMore and more people are opting for electric appliances when they can, dialing back their usage or leaving the gas system altogether. They\u2019re spurred on by federal and state incentives, a desire for healthier homes and workplaces, and concerns around climate pollution from burning gas in homes. In 2023, Cascadian utilities added 29 percent fewer new gas customers than they did in 2020. In Oregon and Washington, that figure is even higher: utilities added 36 percent fewer new customers over that same time period.7\n\nThe region\u2019s gas utilities are still adding customers, but fewer over time, even for utilities that offer line extension allowances. These additions are likely to slow further as energy- and cost-efficient building codes and other forward-looking policies help customers who wish to cut gas from their everyday lives.\n\nIndeed, PSE, Washington state\u2019s largest utility, saw its 2023 levels of annual customer gas use dip below 2019 levels, even when adjusted for yearly temperature differences. It was these declines\u2014and the anticipation of a loss of gas customers\u2014that led the utility to work with state lawmakers to pass HB 1589 in early 2024. The law was intended to help the company plan for a transition of its customers off the gas system. (Washington state ballot initiative 2066 partially repealed HB 1589 in November 2024.)\n\nIn this likely future of accelerating gas customer attrition, today\u2019s line extension allowances only worsen tomorrow\u2019s crisis of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of stranded gas assets. If new customers incentivized to join the gas system by line extension allowances opt to shut off their gas a few years later, the gas infrastructure that served them will not have been paid off yet\u2014not by a long shot\u2014by those customers or the ones left on the gas system.\n\nThanks to Aubrey Pullman for supporting a sustainable Cascadia. Our work is made possible by the generosity of people like you. Donate\n\nClimate policies or no, ratepayers face hundreds of millions of dollars in stranded assets\n\nCustomers in places that have committed to reducing their carbon emissions may sooner opt for electric as they take advantage of policies that help them transition off gas. Sightline estimates that if the new gas users who hooked up to gas in 2022 and 2023 quit the gas system by 2050, utilities in British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington will grow their stranded asset risk by $662 million.8 And financial responsibility for these stranded assets, ultimately, falls to remaining ratepayers.9 While the stranded asset risk may not arrive so soon in places lacking any statutory obligation to reduce carbon emissions, line extension allowances are every bit as expensive for ratepayers in those states, if not more. That\u2019s because Alaska, Idaho, and Montana gas utilities offer even more generous incentives for system expansion than utilities in the rest of Cascadia. (Most of these utilities require existing ratepayers to foot the entire bill for new customers joining the system.) And gas customer growth is slowing down in these states as well: 19 percent fewer new gas customers connected to the system in 2023 compared to 2020, suggesting that growing consumer preference for electric appliances is just as real in these three states.10 $662 million: The additional stranded asset risk that could fall on gas utility customers in British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington will take on if the new gas users who connected in 2022 and 2023 ditch the gas system by 2050.\n\nPut simply, costly line extension allowances proliferate and subsidize soon-to-be-obsolete gas infrastructure, which people facing the highest barriers to getting off gas\u2014think renters and low-income households\u2014will have to pay off in their monthly utility bills for decades.\n\nThe challenge to energy affordability that line extension allowances poses is even worse in areas of Cascadia with a price on carbon. Gas consumers in these places (British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington) pay twice when new gas customers join the gas system\u2014first to extend the pipes to serve these new customers and second to pay for carbon allowances or taxes to cover the new customers\u2019 carbon emissions.\n\nIn Oregon and Washington, the law requires gas utilities to purchase carbon allowances to pay for the pollution from new customers, unless the companies reduce their own emissions in line with state targets.11 Utilities then pass along the cost of purchasing allowances to their customers. While gas utilities in these states receive some free carbon allowances, those freebies do not increase as utilities add customers, and they ratchet down over time to encourage gas utilities to decarbonize.\n\nWashington\u2019s gas utilities have each indicated that their preference for compliance is, by and large, to purchase allowances and pass along the costs to customers rather than reduce company emissions through electrification. Oregon utilities, too, are planning to rely heavily on purchasing \u201cCommunity Climate Investment\u201d credits, which work like allowances\u2014a cost they, too, would then transfer to customers.12\n\nEliminating line extension allowances spares present-day gas customers having to pay for the carbon pollution associated with would-have-been new customers. For example, that 36 percent fewer new gas customers getting added to the rolls in 2023 versus 2020 in Oregon and Washington? That meant gas customers in those states were spared having to pay for an estimated $5.25 million in carbon allowances in 2023, whose cost their utilities would have turned around and added to their bills.13 Once utilities fully end their line extension allowance programs in these states, new gas customer growth will slow further, delivering more savings for existing gas customers.\n\nBritish Columbia also puts a price on carbon. But unlike a growing number of utilities in Oregon and Washington, British Columbia\u2019s major gas utility, FortisBC, offers a line extension allowance that makes extending the pipeline nearly free for new customers, a cost again borne by existing ratepayers.14 If BC officials want to accelerate emissions reductions in line with the province\u2019s climate goals and keep gas bills in check for British Columbians, they would be smart to harmonize these two incongruous policies: one that makes increasing emissions cheap and attractive, and one that seeks to decrease emissions by making them more expensive.\n\nOregon and Washington lead Cascadia in phasing out perverse incentives, but regulators can stamp them out for good\n\nUtility regulators have phased out line extension allowances at four of the seven gas utilities in Oregon and Washington, which service 83 percent of gas consumers in the two states. (See Appendix 1 for the status of line extension allowances in each state and province of Cascadia, by utility.) In summer 2022, Washington regulators took up line extension allowances in the general rate cases of both Puget Sound Energy and Avista, zeroing out the subsidies effective January 1, 2025.\n\nLater in 2022, Oregon regulators reformed NW Natural\u2019s line extension allowance, ratcheting it down by 20 percent annually for three years. And since Sightline last wrote about this topic, Oregon regulators put a sunset date on the subsidies for both Avista and NW Natural, effective January 1, 2027, and November 1, 2027, respectively. Oregon regulators also seem poised to phase out the last of the gas line extensions in the state, according to a recent order for Cascade Natural Gas.15\n\nCascade Natural Gas is in the final stages of its general rate case in Washington. If the commission approves a proposed settlement agreement, line extension allowances for the utility will be phased out entirely by March 1, 2027.16 Washington regulators would be smart to open a proceeding to eliminate NW Natural\u2019s line extension allowance, thus ending the gas infrastructure subsidies across the state.\n\nIn addition to eliminating the allowances, regulators in both states can investigate unauthorized overspending for line extension allowances. Consumer advocate Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board (CUB) estimates that NW Natural overspent on line extension allowances by more than $16 million between 2018 and 2023. Using similar methodology, Sightline estimates Avista may have overspent on line extension allowances by more than $2.4 million between 2017 and 2022.17 Gas customers foot the bill for this overspending. If utilities have subsidized pipeline extensions in excess of approved levels, regulators can remove those expenditures from the rate base, saving customers money.\n\nFor all the reforms underway in Oregon and Washington, other places in Cascadia have yet to start phasing out line extension allowances. The eight gas utilities in Alaska, British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana continue to offer these costly subsidies to encourage expansion of the gas system\u2014a system that customers are shifting away from\u2014and that those stuck on gas will likely have to pay for.\n\nEnding line extension allowances is a win for the climate and consumers\n\nAffordability is top of mind for households across Cascadia, and leaders are eager to reduce energy costs. For decades, gas consumers have been paying to grow the gas pipeline system. This pursuit is now at odds both with consumer trends and preferences and with the climate-protective policies on the books in much of Cascadia\u2014even as that gas system expansion is costing residents and businesses millions of dollars.\n\nRegulators can examine the new economics of the region\u2019s energy system, accounting for the costs of carbon emissions, declining gas use, and mounting customer attrition, to justify eliminating gas line extension allowances all across Cascadia. Doing so will not only result in immediate savings from ending the subsidies but also help Cascadia achieve its climate goals.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The estimate for Avista\u2019s overspending has been corrected due to a calculation error. The previous amount, $3.4 million, was erroneously calculated using line extension allowance equal to one times the annual revenue. However, the Avista tariff allowed for a line extension allowance equal to three times the annual revenue. Using the correct multiplier, the overspending is estimated to be $2.4 million.\n\nAppendix 1\n\nLine extension allowances by utility\n\nUtility Subsidized amount of new gas connections as of January 2025 Line extension allowance Alaska Enstar Natural Gas Full cost of gas line extension, less $1,082 contribution from customer Interior Gas Utility Full cost of gas line extension, less $225 deposit from customer British Columbia FortisBC Full cost of gas line extension, less C$15 deposit from customer Idaho Avista Full cost of gas line extension Intermountain Gas $1,032 Montana Energy West Montana Full cost of first 100 feet onto property Montana-Dakota Utilities Full cost of gas line extension NorthWestern Energy $890 Oregon Avista $1,250 (will be reduced to $0 by Jan. 2027) Cascade Natural Gas Full cost of first 40 feet onto property NW Natural $1,725 (will be reduced to $0 by Nov. 2027) Washington Avista $0 Cascade Natural Gas $1,560 (may be reduced to $0 by Mar. 2027, pending Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission order) NW Natural $2,875 PSE $0\n\nSource: Utility rate schedules, data as of January 1, 2025.\n\nNote: Actual costs of a line extension differ depending on variables such as length of line extension, pipe installation technique, composition of fill surrounding the service line, size of service, and prevailing construction costs in an area. Sightline estimated the line extension allowances above based on average household (residential) gas usage.\n\nAppendix 2\n\nMethodology: Calculating the lifetime cost estimates of line extension allowances issued in 2022\u201323\n\nLifetime costs of line extension subsidies were computed adapting models created by John Barrett of Oregon CUB for the Avista and NW Natural rate cases before the Oregon Public Utility Commission. These models estimated the annual depreciation, taxes, operational/maintenance (O&M) costs, and utility profits of an average line extension allowance over a 60-year time horizon (an estimate of the typical life of a new service). The value of each line extension subsidy was entered into the model and depreciated at an annual rate. The undepreciated value of the asset was used to calculate property taxes and profits for each year. Profits were, in turn, used to compute federal and state taxes due. Annual O&M costs were added to these other costs to yield a total annual cost to customers for the subsidy.\n\nAverage line extension allowance: The value of line extension allowances in 2022 and 2023 was sourced from general rate cases and other regulatory proceedings before the British Columbia Utilities Commission, the Oregon Public Utility Commission, and the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.\n\nDepreciation rate: Book life estimates for the distribution service lines, meters, and house regulators were sourced from each utility\u2019s most recent depreciation study.\n\nTax rates: The model included state/provincial, federal, and property tax rates as well as other miscellaneous taxes that affect revenue, sourced from most recent general rate cases.\n\nOperational/maintenance (O&M) costs: Sightline used a flat $80 annual cost per line extension across all utilities analyzed. This figure matches the values used in the Oregon CUB analysis for Avista and NW Natural.

In the movie, directed and co-written by Morrisa Maltz, she navigates the joy and heartbreak of middle school friendship, especially with her fellow Lakota friend Syriah (played by Syriah Fool Head Means).\n\n\u201cI wasn't expecting to be the one who gets an acting role, especially as a main acting role, and it just made me feel really happy,\u201d Shangreaux told Yahoo Entertainment. She said making the film was a \u201cfun experience\u201d and something \u201cI can be proud of.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShangreaux first appeared in Maltz\u2019s 2022 film The Unknown Country, which starred Lily Gladstone and explored Native American life on and off the reservation. Both films are based on real-life stories told to Maltz by Shangreaux\u2019s mother, Lainey Bearkiller Shangreaux, a close friend of Maltz and a co-writer on the films. (Lainey and her husband, Devin, even got married onscreen during The Unknown Country, and Jasmine is Maltz\u2019s goddaughter.)\n\nFor Maltz, who is not Native, telling these stories in collaboration with the Shangreaux family allowed her to show something \u201cwe can all relate to\u201d \u2014 \u201cgrowing up away from the family or the communities that our parents and our grandparents\u201d were raised in.\n\n\u201cMy grandma was raised in a very small Jewish community in Baltimore, and everyone knew each other until they were 103, and that has kind of died away in a lot of ways,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment, explaining that she moved to South Dakota for her husband\u2019s job as a paleontologist. There, she met Lainey, and the two became fast friends.\n\n\u201cBeing raised in a small town a few hours from the rez is different from being raised in your community where everybody is the same\u201d and shares your culture, Maltz said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing up The Unknown Country with Jazzy wasn\u2019t something that the writer-director had planned, but Jasmine and the stories she and her mother wanted to tell inspired Maltz.\n\n\u201cWe were finishing The Unknown Country\u201d and started making Jazzy at the same time, Maltz explained. \u201cWe already had so much footage of Jazzy, and we all fell in love with Jazzy so much.\u201d\n\nJasmine Bearkiller Shangreaux and Syriah Fool Head Means play best friends in the film.

I'm talking to somebody I knew while growing up, and I know what makes them happy, and I know their comforts and stuff.\u201d\n\nThe children in the film, a mix of Native and non-Native kids, take center stage, to the point where the grown-ups\u2019 faces aren\u2019t even shown for much of it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaltz said that happened organically alongside her cinematographer, Andrew Hajek, who also has a writing credit on the film.\n\n\u201cWe were really focused on the kids and what was going on with them, and suddenly we realized we were just shooting the kids, suddenly realized we have not been shooting any adults.\u201d\n\nShe said that\u2019s what differentiated her film from something like Richard Linklater\u2019s 2014 film Boyhood, another coming-of-age film, which followed a boy\u2019s life from age 6 to 18. Linklater filmed the same young actor (Ellar Coltrane) over a period from 2002-2013.\n\n\u201cIt definitely was the film we were talking about when we started making Jazzy,\u201d she said, of Boyhood. \u201cA lot of coming-of-age movies end up being about the parents even if they're about the kids, and that is definitely something we wanted to avoid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGladstone returns for Jazzy, where she serves as an actress and executive producer.\n\n\u201cI really enjoyed working with her,\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cDespite her being famous and stuff \u2014 because I don't care about popularity because I care about personality mostly \u2014 she was really nice and I felt like she was the one that inspired me to be an actor.\u201d\n\nMaltz said the star of Killers of the Flower Moon was instrumental in both mentoring Jasmine and in bringing more attention to the independent film, which had a budget under $300,000.\n\n\u201cWe're incredibly grateful for her taking the film under her wing,\u201d she said of Gladstone. \u201cIt just helps people see it and helps them be interested\u201d in it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for making a follow-up film tracking Jasmine as she moves into high school or beyond, Maltz hesitated, saying that she and Gladstone are currently working on other projects and are not actively planning to add another related film to her slate, since the first two happened \u201cso organically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know people want to see Jazzy and Syriah growing up.

            "content": "The carsharing industry is at a crossroads. Once hailed as the future of urban mobility, it has seen a mix of success and failure, with some players thriving and others closing shop.\n\nSo we ask: why do some carsharing ventures fail while others continue to grow? And more importantly, what does it take to run a sustainable and profitable carsharing business in today\u2019s competitive landscape?\n\nRecent developments have been telling. Two OEM-backed carsharing ventures have recently shut down, while independent operators continue to expand, and a new entrant \u2013 Kia \u2013 has just launched its own service. This article takes you into the challenges, key success factors, and the evolving role of technology in the industry.\n\nOEMs vs. Startups: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nBefore diving into specific cases, it\u2019s important to clarify what OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are and how they differ from startups. OEMs are traditional car manufacturers \u2013 companies like Kia, Volvo, or Ford \u2013 that primarily produce and sell vehicles under their brand names. Some OEMs have expanded into mobility services, including carsharing, but often struggle because their main focus remains on car sales.\n\nIn contrast, startups and independent operators like GreenMobility are built from the ground up as mobility service providers. They don\u2019t manufacture cars but instead focus entirely on the carsharing experience, optimizing operations, technology, and customer service. This difference in core focus often determines success or failure in the carsharing industry.\n\nOEM Carsharing Ventures\n\nAutomakers have long recognized the potential of carsharing as a way to diversify revenue streams, enhance brand loyalty, and explore new mobility business models. However, history has shown that simply putting cars on the streets and creating an app isn\u2019t enough to make carsharing work.\n\nSeveral OEM-backed carsharing services have struggled to maintain profitability. Volvo\u2019s Volvo On Demand recently announced its closure as part of a broader strategy to optimize costs. Similarly, SEAT ceased operations at the end of 2024 due to declining demand and rising operational costs (\u20ac31 million total losses, with \u20ac11 million lost in 2023 alone, against a turnover of \u20ac16 million).\n\nThe challenges OEMs face in carsharing stem from several factors:\n\nHigh operational costs: Fleet management, maintenance, insurance, and parking fees add up quickly.\n\nFleet management, maintenance, insurance, and parking fees add up quickly. Consumer behavior: Unlike leasing, carsharing requires a behavioral shift from users, who must plan trips around vehicle availability.\n\nUnlike leasing, carsharing requires a behavioral shift from users, who must plan trips around vehicle availability. Integration challenges: Traditional automakers are structured around car sales, not service-based mobility solutions. This makes it difficult to operate carsharing efficiently.\n\nHowever, these closures don\u2019t necessarily mean that carsharing itself is an unsustainable model. Instead, they highlight the need for a different approach \u2013 one that independent players are executing more effectively.\n\nNew Entrants and Independent Operators\n\nWhile OEM carsharing ventures struggle, independent operators like GreenMobility are experiencing growth. Unlike traditional automakers, these companies are built from the ground up as mobility service providers, allowing them to operate more efficiently.\n\nGreenMobility\u2019s growth can be attributed to:\n\nA laser focus on carsharing: Unlike OEMs, which juggle multiple business lines, independent companies dedicate their entire strategy to optimizing the carsharing experience.\n\nUnlike OEMs, which juggle multiple business lines, independent companies dedicate their entire strategy to optimizing the carsharing experience. Smart cost control: Leveraging technology for fleet management and maintenance allows them to run lean operations.\n\nLeveraging technology for fleet management and maintenance allows them to run lean operations. Strategic market selection: Choosing the right cities with high demand and favorable regulatory environments plays a huge role in their success.\n\nBy leveraging a digital-first approach, these companies are able to optimize vehicle utilization, reduce operational costs, and offer a seamless user experience\u2014something OEMs often struggle to achieve.\n\nDoes KIA\u2019s Entry in Carsharing Bring New Hopes?\n\nAmidst the shifting landscape, Kia has entered the carsharing market with its new service, Hyr & Dela. Unlike previous OEM carsharing attempts, Kia\u2019s model focuses on businesses rather than individual consumers. This service allows companies to rent vehicles on a monthly basis and share them among employees, partners, or customers via a digital platform.\n\nWhy does this approach make sense?\n\nHigher vehicle utilization: By targeting businesses, Kia ensures that its vehicles are in use more frequently than traditional consumer-focused carsharing models.\n\nBy targeting businesses, Kia ensures that its vehicles are in use more frequently than traditional consumer-focused carsharing models. Fleet management efficiency: A B2B-focused model allows for easier scheduling, tracking, and maintenance planning.\n\nA B2B-focused model allows for easier scheduling, tracking, and maintenance planning. Electric vehicle (EV) adoption: Kia\u2019s service aligns with the growing trend of businesses adopting EVs for sustainability goals.\n\nIf executed well, Kia\u2019s corporate-focused carsharing model could prove to be a sustainable business approach, avoiding many of the pitfalls that plagued previous OEM carsharing attempts.\n\n5 Lessons We Have Learned from This\n\nSo, what can current and future carsharing ventures learn from these experiences?\n\n1. Adaptability is Key\n\nRigid business models and a lack of flexibility are major roadblocks to success. Carsharing services need to be highly adaptable, leveraging data to adjust pricing, fleet locations, and service offerings dynamically.\n\n2. Cost Management Determines Longevity\n\nCarsharing is a capital-intensive business. Operators need to optimize fleet efficiency, reduce downtime, and control maintenance and insurance costs. This is where independent operators often outperform OEMs, as they are more agile in managing expenses.\n\n3. Technology is a Game-Changer\n\nA carsharing platform is only as good as its technology. Companies partnering with mobility tech providers like ATOM Mobility can benefit from advanced booking systems, automated fleet management, and data-driven decision-making\u2014key elements for a seamless and cost-effective service.\n\n4. Market Selection Matters\n\nChoosing the right city or region for carsharing is crucial. Factors like public transportation integration, parking regulations, and urban population density can make or break a carsharing business.\n\n5. OEMs Need a Service-Oriented Mindset\n\nCarsharing is not just about providing access to vehicles\u2014it\u2019s about service excellence, convenience, and user experience. For OEMs to succeed, they need to rethink their approach and adopt a more customer-centric mindset.\n\nThe Future of Carsharing\n\nThe carsharing industry is at an inflection point. While some OEM-backed services have faced hurdles, independent operators like GreenMobility and strategic initiatives like Kia\u2019s Hyr & Dela show that success is still possible with the right approach. The key lies in adaptability, cost control, technology integration, and market focus.\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve, Kia\u2019s entry into corporate carsharing is an exciting development. With a smart strategy and strong execution, they have the potential to carve out a successful niche in the market.\n\nWe\u2019ll be keeping an eye on Kia\u2019s progress and, in the meantime, wishing them the best of luck in their new venture. Let\u2019s hope they are here to stay!\n\nThis article was originally published by ATOM Mobility.\n\nTags",

For example, \u201cCreatures\u201d included a full-page spread of a fuzzy spider from \u201cThe Pop-up Book of Phobias.\u201d The whimsical animals and imaginative events of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d were showcased in \u201cMythology,\u201d while \u201cStructure\u201d spotlighted abstract lines, shapes and forms, such as those in \u201cCabaret Voltaire\u201d by Howard Munson.\n\nAccording to Keller, the Bowes\u2019 quarterly exhibitions are an opportunity for the library to highlight books that might otherwise only be shown in classrooms. The idea for this particular exhibit came about organically. A colleague at the libraries had asked to look at a few pop-up books, which led Keller and Cornetta to realize the extent of the collection of pop-ups Bowes Library was home to.\n\n\u201cWe thought, \u2018Oh my God, we have so many, this is amazing,\u2019\u201d Keller said.\n\nThe process of curation similarly happened naturally. \u201c They kind of fell into themes by themselves,\u201d Corbetta said. The final selection contains only a third of the books they originally considered, due to difficulties fitting them into the dimensions of the display case among other concerns.\n\nThe exhibit showcases diverse cultures, from Persian mythology in \u201cZahhak: the legend of the Serpent King\u201d by Hamid Rahmanian and Simon Arizpe to the works of Japanese artist Hokusai in \u201cHokusai Pop-Ups\u201d by Courtney Watson McCarthy.\n\nAccording to Keller, a particular challenge was how fragile the books were.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know: is it going to damage a pop-up book to be popped up for two months?\u201d Keller said. To figure out how to handle and safely lay out the pieces, Keller and Corbetta consulted conservators from Stanford Libraries. The final exhibit uses magnets and other supports to preserve the more delicate works.\n\nThe \u201cMythology\u201d themed section contains books such as \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d by L. Frank Baum and Robert Sabuda (Photo: KAYLA CHAN/The Stanford Daily).\n\nYared Avalos-I\u00f1iguez \u201925, who works as a student assistant at the Bowes Library\u2019s virtual resource center, considered \u201cPanoply of Pop-Ups\u201d to be a favorite among the library\u2019s displays. The appeal lies mainly in the surprise of each page, he said. \u201cTo have that 3D element, I think draws you in\u2026 it\u2019s something that feels really unexpected,\u201d Avalos-I\u00f1iguez said.\n\nAlthough pop-up books are usually associated with younger readers, Corbetta considers the collection to be appropriate for everyone.\n\n\u201cAdults are just grown up children,\u201d Corbetta said.\n\nKeller said older audiences may better appreciate the skill involved in the books\u2019 construction.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like little works of engineering that are so amazing. I mean, they look simple, but I think if you really examine them, it\u2019s way more technical than I think people give them credit for,\u201d Keller said.\n\n\u201cPanoply of Pop-Ups\u201d will be available to view for the duration of winter quarter. For audiences who wish to go beyond in their exploration of pop-up books, the \u201cLocked Stacks\u201d collection at the Bowes Art and Architecture Library has an even more extensive collection.",

Hurts answered the challenge, completing 77 percent of his passes for 221 yards, throwing touchdowns to DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown, rushing for a quarterback Super Bowl record 72 yards and scoring his 10th career postseason rushing touchdown.\n\n\n\nHurts, still just 26, was named Super Bowl MVP after the Eagles bludgeoned the Chiefs 40-22 in Super Bowl LIX at the Superdome in New Orleans, a performance that confirmed his place as one of the elite young quarterbacks in the game\u2019s recent history.\n\n\n\nThe only younger quarterbacks to win Super Bowls in the last 30 years are Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, Russell Wilson and Patrick Mahomes. Only Brady and Mahomes were also MVPs.\n\n\n\nThis is historic stuff.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey, it\u2019s a journey of ups and downs and highs and lows,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cI\u2019ve always stayed true to myself and have this vision of being the best that I can be, and that evolved, over time, into this desire to win. You don\u2019t do great things without having good guys around you. The effort, sticking to the script, and always trusting the process is what got us here.\u201d\n\n\n\nHurts has been magnificent since the bye week, and in the only game the Eagles have lost since Week 5 \u2013 at Washington \u2013 he played only 12 snaps.\n\n\n\nSunday\u2019s triumph capped a spectacular run that saw the Eagles go 12-1 to finish the regular season, then sweep the Packers, Rams, Commanders and Chiefs by a combined 145-77 in the postseason.\n\n\n\nDuring those 17 games, Hurts had 19 touchdown passes, 17 touchdown runs and four turnovers.\n\n\n\nAnd despite an early interception Sunday, Hurts did everything he had to for the Eagles to win their second Super Bowl in eight years.\n\n\u201cHe played incredible,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe did amazing. I know I\u2019m throwing adjectives at you, but he played really well. He was poised the whole game, he was in control, he made checks and he threw dimes. He just gave us opportunities, and when we were covered a little bit, he took off running and used his legs.\u201d\n\n\n\nHurts\u2019 77.3 percent completion percentage is fourth-highest in Super Bowl history, and he\u2019s only the fourth quarterback to surpass 70 percent twice. His 119.7 passer rating is 13th-highest in Super Bowl history, and he\u2019s the seventh QB to surpass 100 twice.\n\n\n\nWe could go on and on with remarkable stats, but what Hurts does transcends numbers and statistics.\n\n\n\nHe has a rare knack for making the right play at the right time, whether it\u2019s throwing down the field, taking off and running or avoiding pressure and dumping the ball off.\n\n\n\nIt's won him a ton of regular-season games and a bunch of postseason games. On Sunday, it elevated him and his team to the top of the football world.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that I\u2019ve always respected about Jalen is that he\u2019s a winner,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cAnd I know some people take that as like it\u2019s not a good thing, but you have to find ways to win with your football team that you have around you, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned in my entire career and that\u2019s what he\u2019s come into the NFL and done his entire career.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf he needs to run the ball, he will run it. If he needs to throw the ball, he will throw it and if he needs to make a big play, he will make the big play. And so, that\u2019s stuff that not everybody has, and that\u2019s something that I have a lot of respect for Jalen and I said it after the first Super Bowl we played against them, I said he will be back, and he was, and he got the better of me today.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll face again at some point in our careers in a big game like this.\u201d\n\nStay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Philadelphia sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.\n\nHurts is the first quarterback to lose his first Super Bowl and win the next one since John Elway in 1997.\n\n\n\nHe joins Wilson as only the second quarterback with a Super Bowl passer rating of at least 100 twice before his 27th birthday.\n\n\n\nAnd he becomes the fourth second-round pick to win a Super Bowl, joining Ken Stabler, Brett Favre and Drew Brees.\n\n\u201cIt definitely took a team effort to get us to the point of winning the Super Bowl,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cThe only thing I can think about is the amount of effort and work that has been put in over time.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had a focused group of players out there. Offense was able to score points and take advantage of opportunities, just enough to put points on the board. The defensive players played their asses off like they have been all year.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think we were able to execute and find multiple ways to win together and dominate in the pass game. We did what we needed to do and did what needed to be done.\u201d\n\nListen to instant reactions from the Eagles' Super Bowl victory in the latest Eagle Eye Podcast.\n\nSubscribe to Eagle Eye anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | YouTube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

Chicago Ave., operates out of the former home of Lost Girls Vintage, which recently moved a few blocks north to Wicker Park. Picnic Date Bodega has taken over 1821 W. Chicago Ave., the chamber\u2019s longtime pop-up space next to its offices.\n\nThe pop-up program has welcomed more than two dozen tenants \u2014 some of whom have started permanent businesses in the larger West Town area \u2014 since it launched in 2021.\n\nFor EcoShip founder Aleksandra Plewa, moving into a storefront, even temporarily, is an opportunity to continue expanding her nonprofit and host more events with businesses and customers she works with, she told Block Club.\n\nPlewa started EcoShip after helping her partner collect used packaging materials such as mailers and bubble wrap for his e-commerce business. As more business owners and customers were shipping and receiving merchandise during the pandemic, she saw a massive spike in inventory \u2014 and an increasing desire to reuse products to save money and the environment.\n\nEcoShip at 1947 W. Chicago Ave., in West Town. Credit: Ryan Beshel/Provided\n\nOther businesses thought so too, and EcoShip now collects materials at 14 locations all over the city before making them available for free \u2014 with donations welcome \u2014 online and in-person. Additional items include packaging peanuts, paper and foam packing sheets.\n\n\u201cWe collect packaging materials and donate them back to the community for reuse,\u201d Plewa said. \u201cAll the packaging that we provide is free of charge, and if you\u2019re able to donate, great, if not, not a big deal. But people can drop off any of the items that we have on our list.\u201d\n\nPlewa has already started hosting events at the Chicago Avenue storefront. Upcoming workshops include ones on sewing and mending, candle making and other volunteer opportunities.\n\nEcoShip will also soon offer the ability to print shipping labels, one step toward Plewa\u2019s goal of becoming an all-around resource center for neighbors and small businesses, she said.\n\n\u201cSomething that we really want to continue offering the businesses that we work with is more resources and for them to be able to come with us with questions, whether it\u2019s how to scale up, or how to use like this product instead of this product, or who they can connect with, for example, for their branding,\u201d Plewa said.\n\nPicnic Date Bodega at 1821 W. Chicago Ave. in West Town. Credit: Ryan Beshel/Provided\n\nDown the street, Picnic Date Bodega transformed the West Town chamber\u2019s pop-up space into a mini grocery store of sorts \u2014 just without the food.\n\nThe concept for a grocery-themed boutique came to owner and artist Akaelah Flotho after they began drawing illustrations of food and other products on top of making jewelry.\n\nFlotho expanded the concept to display and sell jewelry, art, ceramics, clothing and books from about 20 artists. All of it is organized by grocery store categories, such as canned goods, a meat counter and produce section.\n\n\u201cFor example, in the seafood counter \u2026 there\u2019s fake ice, there\u2019s oyster earrings, there\u2019s lobster earrings, there\u2019s seafood erasers, seafood cookbooks,\u201d Flotho said. \u201cI love a theme, I love a concept, and the idea of being able to actually make this come to life was really exciting for me.\u201d\n\nThe boutique also plans to host workshops, artist pop-ups and other events throughout its tenancy.\n\nPicnic Date Bodega is open 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays, noon-6 p.m. Thursdays, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Fridays, 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturdays and 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sundays.\n\nEcoShip\u2019s West Town headquarters is open 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Mondays, 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Thursdays and 11 a.m.-3 p.m. on weekends.\n\nListen to the Block Club Chicago podcast:",

            "content": "The 2025 MOTUL FIM Superbike World Championship campaign looks like it\u2019s going to be one of the closest ever with six manufacturers all staking their claim this season. After Honda ended last season strongly, including taking a rostrum at Estoril with Iker Lecuona (Honda HRC), they will be hoping both the #7 and teammate Xavi Vierge can start the new campaign strongly. It\u2019s been a big change over the winter for the Japanese manufacturer, with a new suspension supplier coming in, as Honda looks for a positive start but also aiming to keep their momentum going.\n\nIn recent seasons, Honda have tended to start a season well or end a season well, but rarely have they managed to start and end a campaign well. In 2024, they were well off the pace when the season kicked off but made big steps throughout the season to be in a position where they could challenge for rostrums in the final few rounds; something they achieved with Lecuona standing on the podium at the Circuito Estoril. In testing, despite the #7\u2019s absence at Jerez through injury, it has looked as though Honda will start the season roughly where it ended 2024: a consistent presence in the top ten, perhaps challenging for the occasional podium. The next question is whether they can do in 2025 what they did in 2024 and take big steps throughout the season.\n\nFor the 2022 season, Honda had an overhaul of riders and suppliers, bringing in Lecuona and Vierge while opting to move to Showa suspension. There\u2019s been some change over the 2025 winter too, although less extreme as the rider line-up stays the same, as they move back to Ohlins suspension; the brand they used when they returned to WorldSBK as a full-factory team in 2020. It shows Honda\u2019s quest for success is still ongoing but they\u2019re leaving no stone unturned as they look to celebrate success in WorldSBK.\n\nVierge has been Honda\u2019s benchmark throughout January testing at Jerez and Portimao, with Lecuona missing the Jerez test and not being fully fit at Portimao through a winter training injury. Vierge was seventh on Day 1 in the dry in Spain and second in the wet on Day 2, before finishing P7 on Day 1 at Portimao and ninth on Day 2. Lecuona only tested in Portugal but was ahead of Vierge in the wet, although in the dry, the #97 was the faster of the two.\n\nBoth riders, throughout winter, gave their thoughts about the season ahead. Vierge stated at Jerez: \u201cI\u2019m really excited for a new season. My feeling was that, compared to last year, the base setup of the bike is a little bit better compared to 2024, which, at the end of the season, was quite good. I\u2019m really looking forward to starting this new season and I hope to be fighting inside the top six and to make this last step to fight for podiums regularly.\u201d\n\nLecuona added when speaking at Portimao: \u201cThe first goal is to be 100% ready, mentally and physically. If I\u2019m honest, the first goal is to give the same performance that we had for most of the end of last year; every race we learnt and improved. Finally, we got a podium. I don\u2019t want to say, \u2018every race on the podium\u2019, but I want to be there, the last one of the first group like last year.\u201d\n\nTeam Manager Jose Escamez was optimistic of success in 2025, saying in Spain: \u201cI\u2019m confident that we can keep the momentum that we\u2019ve had since mid-season of 2024. I expect that we can keep improving which we\u2019ve been doing lately. I think that it\u2019s not easy, of course, as the other manufacturers are going to be really strong as they have always proved. At the moment, I\u2019m positive and I\u2019m confident. The target is always to win but that\u2019s a really hard part of this job. As long as we can keep improving every time, it\u2019s going to be good.\u201d\n\nDuring the team\u2019s season launch video, Escamez also revealed that there would be closer ties between Honda Europe and the manufacturer\u2019s test team. He stated when asked about European facilities: \u201cActually, we\u2019ve had a logistical base in Europe since the very beginning of this project. It\u2019s true that this year we are going to increase this collaboration with Honda Europe, which will be more involved with our test team and the development of the bike. We are putting in extra effort with the aim of speeding up our work and the way we reach our goals.\u201d",

            "content": "Before we get started today, a quick note: There will be no Poynter Report on Tuesday or Wednesday. The Poynter Institute\u2019s National Advisory Board is at Poynter\u2019s headquarters in St. Petersburg, Fla. for two days of annual meetings with the institute\u2019s staff. The newsletter will return to your inbox on Thursday. Now onto today\u2019s Poynter Report \u2026\n\nThe presidential interview during the Super Bowl pregame returned on Sunday as President Donald Trump was interviewed by Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier. It was the first time a president sat down with the network hosting the Super Bowl since Joe Biden did it with NBC in 2022.\n\nTurns out, we haven\u2019t been missing anything.\n\nOnly a portion \u2014 about seven minutes \u2014 of Baier\u2019s pre-recorded interview from Saturday with Trump aired during Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl pregame. The rest is expected to air on Baier\u2019s Fox News show tonight at 6 p.m Eastern.\n\nIn the portion that aired in Sunday\u2019s pregame, Baier eased into the interview by asking Trump why he wanted to become the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. And Trump, like many of us (me included), said he was surprised to learn that he was the first sitting president to go to what has become, by far, the biggest sporting event in this country.\n\nThen Baier launched into Trump\u2019s first few weeks in office, and tried to ask Trump about the pushback (including lawsuits) for some of the things he is trying to do early in his second administration. Baier got right to the crux of it by asking Trump about Elon Musk: \u201cBottom line, you say you trust him.\u201d\n\nTrump said Musk is \u201cnot gaining anything\u201d in his role as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. Trump added, \u201cI wonder how he can devote the time to it. He\u2019s so into it.\u201d\n\nBaier asked about Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs and then moved to his best question of this segment, asking Trump about when, if everything goes to plan, families can start feeling some relief when they go to the grocery store or gas pumps.\n\nTrump, however, gave an incomprehensible answer that did not address Baier\u2019s question. Baier did not follow up, or if he did, it was edited out of the segment that ran on air. Either way, it could be chalked up as a missed opportunity for Baier and Fox News to pin the president down on something that was a massive part of his campaign and something he completely dodged in Sunday\u2019s segment.\n\nBaier then posed another decent question, asking Trump about bringing a divided country together. And again, Trump went off on a rambling answer\n\nthat really didn\u2019t answer Baier\u2019s question and, instead, was about trans people and sports. Again, no follow up by Baier. So, again, a missed opportunity.\n\nAll in all, at least when it came to Sunday\u2019s portion of the interview, Baier tried to ask a couple of solid questions, but Trump ducked them and Baier didn\u2019t follow up or his follow-ups were edited out.\n\nThe Super Bowl interview is supposed to be a mix of policy questions, as well as some fun stuff. That\u2019s how these interviews have evolved. But in the end, a pretty meh job by Trump, Baier and Fox News that wasted an opportunity to reach the big audience, which is the whole point of a Super Bowl pregame interview.\n\nIn his Status newsletter, media reporter Oliver Darcy said Baier \u201clobbed a bunch of softballs\u201d at Trump.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if tonight\u2019s portion on Baier\u2019s show is any better, but you would think the best parts would have been included in Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl pregame.\n\nSpeaking of the Super Bowl\n\nDid the game break the all-time viewership record 123.7 million, which was set last year?\n\nWe\u2019ll start to find out today. My guess is it\u2019ll come up just short, but many are predicting that Sunday\u2019s game will break the record when the numbers are added up.\n\nLater in the week, we\u2019ll break down the viewership numbers as well as check out what everyone has been saying about the performance of Fox Sports and lead analyst Tom Brady.\n\nPresident Musk?\n\nTime magazine had an interesting cover last week: a photoshopped Elon Musk sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office.\n\nCNN\u2019s Liam Reilly called it a \u201cprovocative move that could be aimed at stoking President Donald Trump\u2019s ire.\u201d Reilly added, \u201cThe simple cover, which shows Musk, coffee in hand, sandwiched between the presidential desk and the American and presidential flags, is plainly adorned with a red backdrop. The accompanying piece from Simon Schuster and Brian Bennett delves deeper into Musk\u2019s ruthless campaign that has left \u2018millions of government workers (to) find themselves at Musk\u2019s mercy.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump was asked about the cover last week and told reporters, \u201cIs Time magazine still in business? I didn\u2019t even know that.\u201d (Trump gave an interview to Time a little over two months ago when it named him the 2024 Person of the Year).\n\nTrump typically doesn\u2019t take kindly to anyone upstaging him, and there were many who thought it was only a matter of time before Trump grew tired of Musk. In fact, some are surprised that the egos of Trump and Musk have allowed them to coexist this long.\n\nBut on Ezra Klein\u2019s latest podcast for The New York Times, journalist Kara Swish, who knows Musk and the tech industry as well as anyone, says look for the Trump-Musk relationship to last a while.\n\nSwisher said, \u201cI did think they were going to fight, and I know he\u2019s irritating to Trump. You hear that from a lot of people. And I think it\u2019s absolutely true \u2014 Musk probably is irritating. At the same time, Trump loves money. That\u2019s at the heart of him. I think Donald Trump finds him useful, and he is useful to Donald Trump. He\u2019s a useful junkyard dog. And he has a lot of money. So if Trump has a cudgel against these senators, Musk is going to give him money to take them out. He\u2019s got a bank that never ends, essentially.\n\n\u201cHe also knows he needs him to hold on to power. Because what does it look like when they fight? You don\u2019t want Elon Musk outside the tent. That\u2019s a really bad place for Elon Musk to be. And angry \u2014 because he\u2019s shown he has an ability to fight back.\n\n\u201cSo ultimately it could go on for a while. And he could do more and more outlandish things and behave in more and more outlandish ways. Trump has an endless capacity for: \u2018Oh, did he say a racist thing? I don\u2019t care.\u2019 So I think it could go on for a very long time.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of which \u2026\n\nYou absolutely should check out Klein\u2019s conversation with Swisher. It\u2019s a spicy interview \u2014 a very spicy interview. Swisher, who knows her stuff, has brutally honest thoughts on Trump, Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and others. Her comments are eye-opening, humorous, and, at times, completely scary.\n\nYou can read the transcript or listen to the show here.\n\nMoss\u2019 return\n\nPro Football Hall of Famer and broadcaster Randy Moss made an emotional return to ESPN on Sunday, two months after stepping away to be treated for cancer.\n\nMoss was back on set for \u201cSunday NFL Countdown,\u201d which showed a video with messages from various ESPN personalities and other sports stars, including Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\n\nThrough tears, Moss said, \u201cGuys, it\u2019s been hard, but I got a lot of love and a lot of people believing in me. I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d\n\nIt was Moss\u2019 first appearance on ESPN since Dec. 6. ESPN wrote, \u201cThe following week on Instagram Live, he introduced himself as a cancer survivor and explained that a cancerous mass was found in his bile duct, between his pancreas and liver. He said he had surgery to put a stent in his liver on Thanksgiving and underwent a six-hour procedure to remove the cancer. Moss said he would undergo radiation and chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nRemembering a sportswriting legend\n\nLongtime and well-respected sportswriter Ed Hinton, who specialized in covering motorsports for both Sports Illustrated and ESPN, has died. He was 76.\n\nHinton retired in 2014 after a 47-year career that also included stints with the Tribune Company and Orlando Sentinel, where he was an editor for a short time. He covered multiple sports, but was best known for covering autos.\n\nAssociated Press auto racing writer Jenna Fryer told ESPN, \u201cEd Hinton would not approve any obituary, nothing would meet his standards. He certainly wouldn\u2019t stand for one that didn\u2019t include sweating, swearing and smoking. Those are facts, and Ed believed in journalism. He was the stereotypical sports writer, but he commanded the subjects he covered. He wasn\u2019t looking for friends. He was demanding the facts. And he should be remembered for how tough he was on motorsports, particularly surrounding the death of Dale Earnhardt.\u201d\n\nMedia tidbits\n\nHot type\n\nMore resources for journalists\n\nHave feedback or a tip?

            "content": "UPS (UPS 1.33%) has a fascinating value proposition. Based on management's guidance, the stock is an excellent value, but can UPS meet its leadership's expectations?\n\nWhile that question won't be answered in full until at least the second half of 2026, the good news is that investors can use a host of data to monitor events and judge whether the stock is worth investing in.\n\nThe value proposition at UPS\n\nAs noted, based on the company's guidance, UPS is a great value. Management's guidance for 2025 calls for revenue of $89 billion with an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.8% compared to 9.8% in 2024, implying an 8% improvement in adjusted operating profit in 2025. In addition, management expects $5.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF).\n\nBased on Wall Street estimates and management's guidance, UPS currently trades at 14 times 2025 earnings, and 16.6 times 2025 FCF.\n\nThese are attractive multiples in themselves, and even more so for a company that could end 2025 with strong momentum in expanding profit margins and having successfully strategically readjusted its business for growth.\n\nUPS restructures\n\nIt's one thing to see a company at an attractive valuation, and it's another thing to believe in the numbers that make the valuation. In UPS's case, there's a dose of skepticism about its ability to meet its guidance due to the complexity of the changes ahead.\n\nIn a nutshell, UPS has agreed with its largest customer, Amazon (responsible for 11.8% of total company revenue in 2024), to reduce its Amazon deliveries by 50% by the second half of 2026. Also, UPS is bringing SurePost deliveries in-house and away from the United States Postal Service (USPS).\n\nThe Amazon move makes perfect sense on paper, and it's not without precedent -- FedEx has also reduced its Amazon deliveries. The reasoning behind FedEx's previous move and UPS's current move is the same: reduce lower-margin Amazon deliveries and improve margins in the process.\n\nWith the reduction in Amazon volumes negatively impacting revenue but positively impacting margins, Wall Street sees UPS revenue in 2026 comparable to the $91.1 billion in 2024, but with earnings per share up from $7.72 in 2024 to $8.89 in 2026.\n\nUPS faces challenges\n\nHowever, getting to the numbers won't be a walk in the park. UPS will need to reconfigure its network significantly. In the words of CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 on the recent earnings call, UPS will launch \"multiyear initiatives we're calling Efficiency Reimagined, which tackle our processes from end to end, from peak hiring practices to processing payments and more. Efficiency Reimagined should drive approximately $1 billion in savings.\"\n\nCFO Brian Dykes acknowledged that UPS would have to \"bring the fixed asset base, the buildings, the vehicles, the aircraft, in line with the new volume levels.\" Given the scale of UPS's Amazon-based deliveries, it's clear that UPS has a challenge ahead, not least at a time when the U.S. small package market remains in low growth mode.\n\nMonitoring progress at UPS\n\nUltimately, we won't know whether UPS will succeed until 2026. Still, investors can monitor progress, and the key number to follow is the progression of its U.S. domestic segment margin because it's the segment where the changes are due to be enacted. UPS expects its U.S. domestic package segment adjusted operating margin to expand from 7.5% in 2024 to 8.8% in 2025, and then to hit 12% by the end of 2026.\n\nIt's a dramatic improvement and fits into UPS's \"better, not bigger\" framework. Combined with an ongoing focus on growing deliveries in targeted markets like healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), UPS aims to focus on its most profitable deliveries.\n\nIs UPS a buy?\n\nDykes told investors to expect growth in its U.S. domestic operating margin in every quarter through 2025, which will then accelerate in 2026 -- he promised to lay out details on the next earnings call.\n\nAs such, if you want to invest in UPS, you should monitor its progress on this metric. If UPS hits its targets, the stock is likely to appreciate substantially.",

            "content": "The truth is, the food I\u2019ve consumed in San Francisco over the past few weeks has been some of the most exciting of the last year. The secret? I\u2019ve been eating only at pop-ups.\n\nIn the past three weeks, I\u2019ve waited two hours for potato tacos. I\u2019ve twice ducked out of the office early for pizza, first for a thin-crusted, pastrami-topped pie, then for a fennel-laced creation dusted in pollen. Once, I stayed out past my early-for-a-food-writer bedtime for a plate of duck prosciutto served with housemade za\u2019atar crackers.\n\nA decade and a half later, they\u2019ve finally settled into becoming a permanent part of the San Francisco food scene \u2014 though they are by nature temporary themselves \u2014 and, in the wake of the pandemic and with the country\u2019s economic outlook uncertain , are once again thriving.\n\nThe first pop-up restaurants were born of the recession, bursting onto the scene around 2010, as a way for scrappy, upstart chefs to launch restaurant concepts with minimal capital. Sometimes operating outside of legal parameters, these short-lived guerilla restaurants represented an anti-establishment way for chefs to cook without having to answer to investors about the price of ingredients and labor.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve accepted this fact, you will be rewarded with dining experiences, both one-off collaborations and long-term residencies, that are often utterly remarkable \u2014 in part because they are ephemeral. You may fall deeply in love with the chicken Parmesan sandwich at Bette\u2019s , in awe of how the golden cutlet retains its crunchy exterior despite being set between slices of pillowy milkbread and buried under a blanket of melted provolone and a ladle of zippy tomato sauce. But you have to leave knowing you may never taste it again: Bette\u2019s hasn\u2019t announced any future dates.\n\nBut before you, too, dive into this dining sport, consider yourself warned. Pop-ups require the digging of a detective and the zen of a Buddhist monk: following chefs on Instagram; patiently waiting for them to announce their next dinner; enduring long lines and bumpy service and \u2014 sometimes \u2014 rowdy diners who have been guzzling martinis on empty stomachs for two hours while they wait for the food to show up. (OK, fine, that was me.)\n\nGet our editors\u2019 top restaurant picks, access to tough reservations, heads-up on new pop-ups, and more in our Off Menu weekly newsletter.\n\nProfit is rarely the main motivation. Chefs aren\u2019t likely to reach financial stability exclusively selling Swedish hot dogs or smashburgers or a highly specific style of regional pizza. The only hope is that they might attract investors or accolades that can help them get there, a financial gamble I\u2019ll be exploring in another story.\n\nFor chefs, pop-ups offer both benefits and drawbacks. While a restaurant requires a significant financial investment, all a chef needs to start a pop-up is unbridled passion and a hell of a lot of sweat equity. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll often find pop-up menus laser-focused on a single item, usually the result of an obsessive dedication to perfection.\n\nFor the diner, however, the hunt is part of the thrill. Knowing my favorite pop-up could suddenly appear with little warning at some dive bar in a corner of the city I rarely frequent adds to the allure. There\u2019s pleasure in the anticipation and delight of discovering something you can\u2019t book on OpenTable or Resy . We diners have everything to gain from these passion projects. All we have to do is hunt them down and reap the rewards.\n\n5 pop-ups worth popping into in SF\n\nHunting down pop-ups takes effort, but you\u2019ll have a head start if you keep an eye on these. The best bet for catching events, which are usually announced a few weeks in advance, is to follow each business on Instagram.\n\nHadeem\n\nSpencer Horovitz\u2019s Hadeem is easily the hottest pop-up in town, thanks in part to a nod from the James Beard Foundation, which named him among the country\u2019s top emerging chefs. Horovitz\u2019s nostalgia-fueled cuisine blends dishes from across the Jewish diaspora with California ingredients, resulting in food capable of connecting with diners whether they grew up eating potato knishes or scallion pancakes.\n\nBette\u2019s\n\nYou\u2019ve never had chicken Parmesan like Bette\u2019s. Since 2019, Danielle Grivet has been perfecting her recipe, which starts with brined chicken breast that gets breaded and fried to order. Cherry tomato sauce, melted provolone, and fresh basil are the only adornments on a sandwich that\u2019s somehow much greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nIlna\n\nMaz Naba brings decades of hospitality experience to his sophisticated California-Lebanese pop-up Ilna, where diners can find Eastern Mediterranean classics refreshed with global influences and local produce. Dry-aged beef dumplings swimming in yogurt sauce get a kick from za\u2019atar pepper crunch, while kousa mahshi, a traditional stuffed zucchini dish, features a filling of Dungeness fried rice and a crisp pepita-date topping.\n\nHej Hej\n\nSan Francisco has strong hot dog culture, but Amelia Eudailey brings a new dimension to the scene with Hej Hej, the Swedish pop-up she launched last year. The Classic Swede stars a pork-shoulder frankfurter that gets buried under cheesy mashed potatoes, bay shrimp salad, dill pickles, ketchup, mustard, and fried shallots. Two hands are definitely required.",

            "content": "The board of United Parcel Service, Inc. ( ) has announced that the dividend on 6th of March will be increased to $1.64, which will be 0.6% higher than last year's payment of $1.63 which covered the same period. This makes the dividend yield 5.8%, which is above the industry average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnited Parcel Service's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\n\nWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, the dividend made up 90% of cash flows, but a higher proportion of net income. This indicates that the company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than reinvesting to grow the business.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 38.7%. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 76% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable.\n\nUnited Parcel Service Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $2.68 total annually to $6.52. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.3% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nUnited Parcel Service May Have Challenges Growing The Dividend\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that United Parcel Service has been growing its earnings per share at 5.7% a year over the past five years. Although per-share earnings are growing at a credible rate, the massive payout ratio may limit growth in the company's future dividend payments.\n\nUnited Parcel Service's Dividend Doesn't Look Sustainable\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think United Parcel Service's payments are rock solid. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

Interestingly, Piazzolla was quoted as saying \u201cFor me, tango was always for the ear rather than the feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe felt that he was writing music to be played by orchestras and he wanted it to be taken seriously,\u201d Velasco explained. \u201cI thought, that makes sense to me. He wanted a heightened version of the tango and that\u2019s what we are doing.\u201d\n\nSan Diego Ballet received funding from the National Endowment of the Arts for commissioning a local artist to compose new music for next weekend\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cCarnival of the Animals,\u201d the second part of the show, will be accompanied by an original Latin jazz score from trumpeter and resident composer Gilbert Castellanos, who will perform on stage with his band.\n\nOriginally choreographed in 2003 by Christopher Wheeldon for the New York City Ballet, \u201cCarnival of the Animals\u201d tells the story of a young boy who falls asleep at the American Museum of Natural History and dreams of people he knew as animals.\n\nA humorous, classical score by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns accompanied the story and youngsters were charmed by dancers performing in animal costumes, including a flamingo, a rhinoceros and a swan.\n\nVelasco\u2019s more adult version is still a lot of fun, but it takes the attention off showy costumes and, instead, alludes to the characters through movement and simpler dance attire.\n\nAt last month\u2019s rehearsal, San Diego Ballet\u2019s company dancers wore smiles, which disguised the effort required for Velasco\u2019s demanding movement language.\n\nElena Diaz Flores is a petite, technically skilled dancer who plays the Tiger to well-muscled Marshall Whiteley\u2019s Lion.\n\nThey held each other\u2019s gaze in a playful pas de deux that included challenging overhead lifts. His Lion solo was additionally impressive, with a series of cabriole jumps, an athletic move where the extended legs beat together at an angle in midair.\n\nIn her role as the Flamingo, Stephanie Maiorano wears a sparkly pink bra, a pink skirt and a pink feather in her hair.\n\nHer pas de deux with Jonas Olivera, who plays a graceful but determined Rhinoceros, is, in Maiorano\u2019s words, \u201cmore daredevil.\u201d\n\nTheir duet includes a treacherous move known as a fish dive.\n\nOlivera lifts Maiorano over his head, with her legs extended, one straight, one bent at the knee, before she flips forward and drops along the length of his body.\n\nElizabeth Tapia performed her Crocodile role with agile jumps and pirouettes while a half dozen Fish dancers performed a frisky conga line behind her.\n\nSierra Crocker, a Fish dancer, said the fish costumes included fun, round eye glasses that resemble fish eyes.\n\nFor Crocker, as with many of the dancers who have performed the children\u2019s version of \u201cCarnival,\u201d this is familiar choreography but with different music.\n\n\u201cThis year, this new music is definitely more upbeat and more rooted in jazz,\u201d she said enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cFor me, it feels funkier than what we have done in the past.\u201d\n\nIn the youth performances of \u201cCarnival,\u201d Velasco used sections of the traditional Saint-Sa\u00ebns score along with a variety of popular music to accompany his choreography \u2014 a decision that was entertaining, but it lacked the cohesion and integrity he desired for this show.\n\nThe new version required composer Castellanos to create music that complemented established choreography within a specific time frame.\n\nCastellanos composed 10 songs, but he said it wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cWhen Javier approached me with this idea in 2023, he said that it would be based on children\u2019s songs and the dancers had rehearsed to it already,\u201d Castellanos recalled.\n\n\u201cI thought, this is really going to be great. But then I discovered this would be a huge challenge for me. I spent a lot of time with this material and I pushed myself to be creative.\u201d\n\nHowever, watching the San Diego Ballet dancers over the years gave Castellanos the inspiration and perspective he needed.\n\n\u201cI learned to be disciplined in terms of molding a tune,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI consider the dancers to be extensions of the band. I realized that they think like a musician in terms of tempos and cues. I can visually imagine them doing an eight-bar phrase or a part where it\u2019s legato, or it slows down. It\u2019s like looking at a piece of music coming to life.\u201d\n\nSan Diego Ballet presents: \u2018Carnival of the Animals and Tangata\u2019\n\nWhen: 2 and 7 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 15\n\nWhere: Baker-Baum Concert Hall, Conrad Prebys Performing Arts Center, 7600 Fay Ave., La Jolla\n\nTickets: $18-$68\n\nInfo: 858-459-3728\n\nOnline: theconrad.org",

With that, he slammed the door and handed in his resignation.\n\nIn came Pompeo to replace him, impressing upon State Department officials that \u201cTrump is not a moron. He is simply an unconventional genius.\u201d Trump, ever the professional showman, played the role of unconventional genius to the hilt in the Middle East with Pompeo in the director\u2019s chair. In fact, he played it so well that world leaders began to think that he was the one behind the Abraham Accords.\n\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.

They must remember he thinks of himself as the leader of the entire world, someone with no rivals. Let no amount of flattery go to waste, even in its crudest forms. If they aren\u2019t willing to lick Trump\u2019s backside, their most bitter geopolitical enemies will polish it until it shines, starting with his ex-KGB handler in the Kremlin. He is already chomping at the bit to get his chance to do some polishing. It\u2019s something straight out of the Sergei Yesenin poem \u201cKhlopusha\u2019s Monologue\u201d: \u201cLead me to his presence, lead me to him, I want to see this man!\u201d\n\nOther Topics of Interest Did the US Collaborate With Russia for the Recovery of Kursk Oblast? Ukraine\u2019s defeat in Kursk could have been the result of a secret deal between the US and Russia, akin to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939.\n\nPutin wants to \u201csee this man\u201d so that he can smooth-talk him in two hours flat into being his obedient lapdog, just like he did in Helsinki.\n\nUS President Donald Trump (L) and Russia's President Vladimir Putin arrive to attend a joint press conference after a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, on July 16, 2018. The US and Russian leaders opened an historic summit in Helsinki, with Donald Trump promising an\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin considers himself, with some justification, to be the alpha male in this relationship. Under no circumstances must the grown-ups allow this unconventional genius to remain alone in a room with such a professional manipulator.\n\nIn order to work effectively with their client, the grown-ups need to come up with an explanation that fits Trump\u2019s unconventional mind to frame the war being waged across the globe. His clip-thinking consciousness has been ruptured; it is incapable of seeing connections between what is happening in the Middle East, Ukraine, and the Pacific Rim. It is a given that Trump must be at the center of any proposed plan; he must be the global demiurge and future Victor in the Final World War.\n\nThe three horsemen of the geopolitical underworld \u2013 China, Russia, and Iran \u2013 are now free to act with impunity.\n\nTotalitarian regimes the world over, filled with centuries of hatred towards the West, were watching intently as the reputational catastrophe that was the US\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan unfolded live on television screens across the globe. These regimes took this failed withdrawal as a sign of fundamental weakness within the decadent and hedonistic (as they saw it) Western civilization and looked on with satisfaction as its establishment began to surrender its global leadership role. The three horsemen of this geopolitical underworld \u2013 China, Russia, and Iran \u2013 now free to act with impunity (the US is gone and they can get away with anything), threw down the gauntlet to the Free World by announcing their intentions to destroy, in a deliberate manner, three sovereign nations \u2013 Taiwan, Ukraine, and Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe initial reaction from the United States \u2013 the leader of the Free World \u2013 was shameful and did nothing but encourage its enemies. The head of the CIA \u2013 Bill Burns \u2013 traveled to Moscow and offered Putin a behind-the-scenes promise. He wouldn\u2019t allow Ukraine, the only victim of aggression here, to conduct retaliatory strikes on Russian territory. The agency under his leadership then released its professional prediction for an invasion: Kyiv would fall in a week, two at most.\n\nBut Burns and his agency were wrong. The first climactic battle of World War IV took place at Hostomel and resulted in a miracle on the Dnipro \u2013 the horde was soundly defeated. Those 300 symbolic Ukrainian Spartans saved Western civilization from a barbarian invasion and literally dragged the United States by the scruff of the neck back onto the world stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout a year and a half later, with the West still in the throes of a cowardly indecisiveness, Iran embarked on its multipronged operation to destroy Israel. And with that a fourth horseman appeared.\n\nA new political reality had begun to take shape in Washington. The far-left (progressive) wing of the Democratic Party and its accompanying ideology became almost fanatically invested in a World War IV unleashed by totalitarian regimes. Many progressives sided with the tyrants and the bandits. After all, they had loathed the \u201cImperial West\u201d since their college years and wanted to see it defeated. Their professors at Harvard and Yale, you see, had drummed it into them that this West was guilty of centuries of crimes against the world\u2019s oppressed nations.\n\nAt the moment there are not that many progressives in Congress, but they do wield great influence at \u201cquality\u201d media outlets. As far as World War IV is concerned, these outlets essentially serve as propaganda mouthpieces for Hamas on the Israeli front and for Putin on the Ukrainian one.\n\nThese progressives demand an immediate cease-fire both in the Middle East and in Ukraine \u2013 in other words a kind of Afghanistan on steroids \u2013 with another embarrassing US withdrawal from the world stage.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory in the presidential elections was first and foremost a triumph over these progressives \u2013 the fourth horseman of the geopolitical apocalypse. His election has essentially untied the West\u2019s hands at a critical moment and given it a unique window of opportunity to achieve a larger, historic victory over all its enemies. What\u2019s more, this victory will be more of a conceptual, theoretical one and will not result in a significant loss of human life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIran is an easy fix. No boots on the ground will be required from the West. Israel will simply conduct one devastating strike (perhaps with US participation for certain specialized facilities). After that, the rebuilding of what used to be Iran will fall to the country\u2019s resurgent urban youth along with a joint Turkish-Azerbaijani military force, already deployed in the Iranian part of Azerbaijan to protect its countrymen.\n\nThe cowardly, over-cautious (or consciously traitorous) Biden administration never permitted Ukraine to exploit its spectacular successes at the outset of the war and achieve Victory in 2022 or 2023 (a return to 1991 borders and complete restoration of the country\u2019s territorial integrity). Instead, the conflict changed shape and became an exhausting war of attrition, a circumstance not at all in Ukraine\u2019s favor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople then began discussing in earnest a \u201cKorea scenario\u201d for freezing the conflict. Cognizant of the Soviet peoples\u2019 historic contribution to an Allied victory in WWII and keen on preventing the loss of hundreds of thousands more Russian and Ukrainian lives, President Trump made a unique offer to the dictator in the Kremlin \u2013 he would pull Putin out of the gruesome mess he got himself into as a vassal to China.\n\nFor this, he must agree to cease all combat activity along the line of contact. Of course, there will be no recognition of his territorial gains. He will be allowed to keep them for a certain amount of time and remain in power in Russia, after he tells his obsequious minions that victory has been achieved, of course.\n\nWestern troops will guarantee that the main part of Ukraine remains safe and prosperous (as was the case with Korea). It doesn\u2019t really matter what they are called \u2013 peacekeepers, volunteers, contractors...\n\nThe majority of these troops will come from Europe. Trump has called on Europe for years to take on more responsibility for its own security. The very real threat hanging over the continent at the moment only serves to strengthen Trump\u2019s argument. Macron has long been trying to persuade his counterparts that EU countries must play a role in Ukraine.\n\nEurope has wished for its own army for decades. But, as Zelensky correctly noted in Davos: \u201cFor the first time in 75 years, Europe has its own army, one capable of stopping the Eastern horde. It is the Armed Forces of Ukraine plus aircraft provided by Europe.\u201d\n\nThis new resolve we are seeing from Europe will allow Trump and his allies to effectively provide for Ukraine\u2019s security in the same way that President Eisenhower in his day provided for the security of South Korea \u2013 by deploying an expeditionary Allied force.\n\nIt is precisely these wars \u2013 waged by Ukraine and Israel, at enormous cost and suffering \u2013 that provide Trump with a unique opportunity to remove the China threat once and for all.\n\nIf Putin chooses to decline Trump\u2019s offer, he loses everything. It is no coincidence that the Putin propaganda machine has been sending out trial balloons of late that seek to justify accepting the offer: \u201cWe have already won! We have seized a land corridor to Crimea and weakened the Ukrainian army!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fitting resolution really \u2013 the Putin regime is destroyed while Putin temporarily keeps his head and his throne.\n\nPresident Trump believes, with good reason, that communist China is the US\u2019s most powerful and dangerous enemy. But until recently this indisputable fact has led him to come to the totally incorrect conclusion. He thought the key to countering the Chinese threat was to settle two conflicts he saw as nothing but distractions \u2013 those in Ukraine and in the Middle East. It was a colossal mistake.\n\nIt is precisely these wars \u2013 waged by two great peoples, Ukrainian and Israeli, at enormous cost and suffering \u2013 that have provided the Free World with a unique opportunity to remove the China threat once and for all. And without shedding a drop of blood.\n\nI strongly believe that a double beheading (Iran and Russia), for all the world to see, would force the remaining head of this Chinese dragon to come to its senses and forget about its hostile intentions vis-a-vis an independent Taiwan and any plans for a political and military confrontation with the US.\n\nThere is one major obstacle preventing the client from making full use of the pedagogic material set forth above \u2013 his manic obsession with winning a Nobel Peace Prize. This fixation gives Putin a massive amount of recruiting potential. He will thank Trump for his offer, gaze at him with devoted, admiring eyes, and promise to provide any support needed in his quest for the Nobel. His territorial demands will be strikingly modest. But what he will do is smooth-talk Trump into including a couple of innocent lines into the final peace agreement about \u201csecurity guarantees for Russia.\u201d And then, after Trump receives his deserved Nobel, Putin will use these \u201cguarantees\u201d to come for the rest of Ukraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s obsession with a Nobel Peace Prize (he is absurdly jealous of Obama) might just disappear when he will be presented with a much more impressive red carpet into the history books.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson won World War I.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt won World War II.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan won World War III (the Cold War).\n\nAll three of these great American presidents were certain that they had won the final World War. Unfortunately, each victory contained a flaw that inevitably led to the next global conflict.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been presented with a mission of epic proportions \u2013 to defeat the Empire of Evil in the Fourth and Final World War, to do it with relatively little effort and resources spent, and all within the first 100 days of his second presidential term.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are the author\u2019s and not necessarily those of Kyiv Post.",

            "content": "United Parcel Service (UPS 1.33%) stock fell 14.1% on Jan. 30 after the company reported disappointing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The stock is now at its lowest level since July 2020.\n\nDividend raises, paired with a beaten-down stock price, have pushed UPS' yield up to a mouthwatering 5.9% at the time of this writing. But given the company's challenges, some investors may wonder if the high yield is too good to be true.\n\nHere's where UPS went wrong, why the situation could get worse before it gets better, but why UPS is a high-yield dividend stock worth buying now for patient investors.\n\nBroken promises\n\nLet's take a trip back to March 2024. UPS stock was hovering around a three-year low. To regain investor trust, management hosted an investor presentation detailing ways to get the business back on track over the next three years.\n\nUPS had badly overestimated package delivery volumes, thinking that a COVID-19-induced increase in e-commerce would lead to sustained growth. Or, at the very least, consumers would permanently adapt their behavior to incorporate more purchases online. So UPS overexpanded its routes and positioned the business for demand that never lived up to expectations -- resulting in lower sales and falling margins.\n\nIn its investor presentation, UPS adjusted its 2026 forecast for U.S. small package average delivery volume to 98 million packages compared to early estimates for 108 million packages by 2023. The target implied a much more reasonable 5.5% compound annual growth rate between 2023 and 2026. In the presentation, UPS forecast 2026 revenue of $108 billion to $114 billion compared to 2023 revenue of $91 billion. The idea was to expand revenue in 2024, and then focus more on margins in 2025 and 2026.\n\nUnfortunately, UPS failed to deliver on its promises in 2024. The company grew revenue by just 0.1%, operating margins declined, and adjusted diluted earnings per share fell 12.1%. In other words, UPS is moving in the wrong direction -- putting its 2026 targets in jeopardy.\n\nA crucial Amazon update\n\nUPS is already struggling, so it took investors off guard when the company announced a major change to its relationship with Amazon (AMZN 2.09%). Despite Amazon being UPS' largest customer, UPS expects to cut Amazon volumes by 50% by the second half of 2026. The move could bolster margins but at the expense of revenue. UPS CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said the following on the earnings call:\n\nWe've been partnered to Amazon for nearly 30 years, and we hold that company in high regard. Amazon is our largest customer but it's not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business. Our contract with Amazon came up this year. And so we said it's time to step back for a moment and reassess our relationship. Because if we take no action, it will likely result in diminishing returns. So we considered a number of different options and landed on what we think is the best option for our company, and that is to accelerate the glide down of their volume with us, as we commented in our prepared remarks by more than 50% by June of 2026.\n\nUPS' margins have taken a hit, so it's understandable that the company wants to improve them. But cutting the reliability that Amazon brings to its revenue stream is a controversial move, especially given how vulnerable the business has been in recent years.\n\nUPS is a buy for long-term income investors\n\nUPS has sold off for valid reasons. The company's sales and margins have declined for a few years now, and 2025 isn't expected to bring a quick turnaround. UPS is guiding for revenue of $89 billion and operating margins of 10.8% -- which would be an improvement from 2024 margins but slightly lower revenue.\n\nGiven the state of the business, UPS stock arguably deserves to be at its lowest level in years. The good news is that management has ripped off the proverbial bandage by setting a bleak outlook for 2025.\n\nThe stock chart would indicate UPS is a steal at current levels, given the extent of the sell-off. However, investors would be wise to focus on business results rather than using price action as a yardstick for whether the stock is a good value. Given the guidance for 2025, it could take several more years for the turnaround to play out.\n\nIn the meantime, UPS' 5.9% yield is a worthwhile incentive to hold the stock through this difficult period. And the stock's mere 16.4 price-to-earnings ratio suggests it is a good value, even based on weak trailing earnings results.\n\nStill, investors should only approach the stock if they agree with management's strategic direction, which could include even more efficiency improvements at the expense of sales. It could be the right decision long term, but the road to get there will be bumpy at best.",

The workshop was led and primarily attended by rank-and-file members, with participants including stewards and union staff.\n\nArticle 37 contains the rights won by UPS Teamsters that protect workers from harassment; but workers are often unaware of their rights protecting them from such harassment or often do not realize the mistreatment they are enduring from management constitutes harassment at all.\n\nWhat constitutes harassment under article 37? Harassment is \u201cover-supervision, coercion, intimidation, or retaliation taken against workers in performance of their duties or enforcement of their rights.\u201d\n\nIt is important to remember that it is more effective to file a grievance on article 37 in conjunction with other articles, for example article 52 (suspension), article 36 (discrimination), 21 (attempting to prevent union protected activities), and article 18 (safety).\n\nA group activity was conducted to help each participant hone their skills in writing grievances to enforce their rights in fighting harassment, with participants sharing strategies for how to make their grievances most effective.\n\nThe militant rank-and-file unionists that led the meeting plan to continue to conduct workshops informing workers of their rights and how to enforce them, with a workshop planned to cover the rights afforded workers to protect them from the heat in the coming months.\n\n#ArlingtonTX #TX #Labor #Teamsters #UPS",

That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for HighPeak Energy\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At HighPeak Energy\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman & CEO Jack Hightower for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$15.50 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$13.83 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. Jack Hightower was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.\n\nJack Hightower purchased 303.65k shares over the year. The average price per share was US$15.41. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNasdaqGM:HPK Insider Trading Volume February 8th 2025\n\nHighPeak Energy is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of under-the-radar companies with insider buying.\n\nDoes HighPeak Energy Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. HighPeak Energy insiders own about US$292m worth of shares (which is 17% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At HighPeak Energy Tell Us?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded HighPeak Energy shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like HighPeak Energy insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of HighPeak Energy.",

Indeed, management's guidance for 2025 revenue is $89 billion compared to $91.1 billion in 2024, but if margins expand as expected due to the change, then the company's adjusted operating profit will grow by about 8%.\n\nClearly, the market is worried about execution risk because UPS needs to significantly restructure its network to accommodate the reduction in Amazon volume.\n\nWhy the change is good news for UPS\n\nAs the Citi analyst notes, the change creates a significant opportunity to replace low- or even zero-margin Amazon deliveries (notably the difficult deliveries to residential addresses) with the higher-margin deliveries in end markets (like the healthcare sector and small and medium-size businesses) that UPS is targeting for growth.\n\nThis argument makes perfect sense and aligns with the company's \"better not bigger\" framework for maximizing the profitability of its deliveries rather than chasing volume growth. In this context, its relationship with Amazon has always somewhat been out of sync with its underlying objectives.\n\nAs such, investors should welcome the change but also monitor the company's progress in executing the plan. Given that the stock trades at slightly more than 14 times analyst expectations for earnings in 2025, the Citi price target looks reasonable.",

            "content": "Over the last few years, I have gotten active in TDU and the UPS Teamsters United network. Here\u2019s why.\n\nUPS Teamsters United is a national network of Teamster activists at UPS that builds union power by informing and mobilizing members from the bottom up.\n\nThrough UPS Teamsters United, I\u2019ve networked with other union activists across the country, shared contract enforcement strategies, and learned new skills as a union activist.\n\nTDU first launched the UPS Teamsters United campaign to prepare for 2018 UPS contract negotiations.\n\nMembers organized a nationwide grassroots contract campaign to oppose the creation of the two-tier 22.4 driver position and to demand higher pay and more full-time jobs for part-timers. TDU helped build a Vote No effort, and a majority of members voted against the contract. But Hoffa imposed it anyway.\n\nThat\u2019s when UPS Teamsters United went from mobilizing members to Vote No to uniting members to vote for change.\n\nFighting For Better Contracts\n\nI first got involved in TDU and UPS Teamsters United as part of the campaign to elect the Teamsters United Slate in 2021.\n\nWe campaigned to elect Sean O\u2019Brien and Fred Zuckerman and helped build the UPS contract campaign.\n\nDuring the 2023 UPS contract campaign, UPS Teamsters United activists passed out leaflets, collected signatures on the Contract Unity Pledge, organized rallies and parking lot meetings, and helped organize practice picketing.\n\nUPS Teamsters United held online webinars throughout the contract campaign to show members how to do this. The webinars kept members updated and gave us a way to share strategies for organizing the contract campaign in our areas.\n\nEducation Is Power\n\nToday, TDU and the UPS Teamsters United network is focused on educating members, enforcing the contract, and developing new union activists at UPS.\n\nWe hold online webinars and in-person workshops, and build local, regional and national networks.\n\nAs a shop steward, I participate in TDU webinars and invite other members in my building to attend. I help organize parking lot meetings and pass out leaflets and toolkits from UPS Teamsters United. I also participate in my local\u2019s volunteer organizing committee.\n\nA group of UPS Teamsters United activists and stewards in my local have also recently started a weekly reading group where we discuss books on topics like just cause and legal rights of union stewards.\n\nI have been building a network of other UPS stewards and activists in the Central Region to share strategies and resources. We have an active group chat, and we hold conference calls and Zoom meetings to keep others informed.\n\nWhen a new issue comes up, like new SurePost volume or confusion over the starting date for 9.5 rights, it\u2019s really helpful to be able to discuss them with UPS Teamsters activists from many different locals whom I trust.\n\n\n\nAll of the UPS Teamsters United resources are available at www.upsteamstersunited.org. If you are interested in finding out more, join a webinar or call TDU at 313-842-2600.\n\n\n\nEnforce 9.5 Rights\n\n\n\nLast year I talked to a group of drivers in my center about their 9.5 rights, and we all started filing together. We checked in with each other. We got up to 15 drivers getting quadruple time checks. This year with the increased SurePost volume we need to ramp up our 9.5 enforcement.\n\n\n\nTheresa Antal\n\nLocal 776, Harrisburg, Pa.\n\n\n\nStay Informed\n\n\n\n\u201cI found TDU through website posts and webinars about the UPS contract campaign and was inspired to become a shop steward. Now I use the TDU webinars to become more\n\neffective at contract enforcement. After one of the webinars, another TDU member from my local called me to check in. He helped me grow as a steward and introduced me to other stewards. Before TDU, I felt pretty disconnected from the union outside of my rural building, but now I feel like I have a union community.\u201d\n\n\n\nRacheal Stoops\n\nLocal 413, Columbus\n\n\n\nNetwork With Other Teamsters\n\n\n\n\u201cI have really seen the value of TDU since I got introduced to the larger network of experienced activists and stewards at UPS. I use group chats and conference calls with other UPS Teamsters United activists to stay up to date on the latest panel decisions and management tactics at UPS so I can share the updates with my people in Toledo. I also now have several mentors from other locals who I can call on with any specific questions with problems at my building.\u201d\n\n\n\nDemario Jennings\n\nLocal 20, Toledo",

            "content": "UPS' (UPS 1.33%) recent fourth-quarter earnings report was monumental. It wasn't so much the numbers from the final quarter of 2024 as it was management outlining the strategic changes it was making to its business. The market didn't like the update much, sending the stock sharply lower. At the time of writing, it's down 9.4% in 2025.\n\nStill, the changes align with management's philosophy, and there's a robust case for arguing that the stock is an excellent value right now. Here's the lowdown.\n\nUPS delivers change\n\nLet's start by looking at the changes announced by UPS. CEO Carol Tome said the changes were necessary, as UPS could \"lose momentum\" in the U.S. unless it addressed three specific challenges:\n\nA slowing U.S. small package delivery market with \"changing package characteristics\" -- indeed, UPS management overestimated demand in the U.S. small package market for the last two years\n\nAn over-reliance on its largest customer, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- Amazon was responsible for 11.8% of total company revenue in 2024\n\n-- Amazon was responsible for 11.8% of total company revenue in 2024 A reliance on the United States Postal Service (USPS) for its UPS SurePost (lower cost, less urgent deliveries)\n\nManagement decided to take pre-emptive action over these \"challenges\" in two ways. First, it agreed with Amazon to gradually lower its delivery volumes until it had 50% of its current volume by the second half of 2026. As noted above, Amazon is a major customer, and this implies a significant reduction in volume and revenue from the e-commerce company.\n\nSecond, UPS will bring the SurePost deliveries currently undertaken by the USPS in-house.\n\nThese changes can immediately be seen in the full-year 2025 guidance, whereby management expects lower revenue (fewer Amazon deliveries) but higher overall operating margin and higher operating margin in the U.S. domestic package segment. Consequently, management expects adjusted operating profit to improve as it enacts the strategic change of adjusting its network away from lower-margin Amazon deliveries and reaps the benefit of a positive shift in margin.\n\nUPS Guidance 2024 2025 (Est) Revenue $91.1 billion $89 billion Non-GAAP adjusted operating profit margin 9.8% 10.8% Implied non-GAAP adjusted operating margin* $8.9 billion ~$9.6 billion*\n\nRisks ahead for UPS\n\nIn theory, at least, the plan makes sense, but the market sold the stock off on the news, and many Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets on it. The reasoning behind both moves most likely comes from skepticism over the execution of UPS' plans to simultaneously lower Amazon delivery volumes and lower costs in its network. CFO Brian Dykes promised more color on the issue on the first-quarter earnings call in a few months, but investors have reason to be cautious, given UPS' execution over the last couple of years.\n\nWhy UPS is well-placed\n\nThat said, most of UPS' problems in recent years have come from a combination of lower-than-expected U.S. small package delivery volume and a protracted and costly labor dispute in 2023.\n\nMoreover, there are clear indications that UPS is improving its underlying business. Its three-year transformational plans outlined on its Investor Day last year involve continued focus on expanding deliveries in targeted areas like small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and healthcare, while investing in productivity-enhancing IT (automation and smart facilities) to enable asset consolidation.\n\nThe early results have been encouraging. SMB volume as a share of U.S. volume rose to 28.9% in 2024 from 28.6% in 2023, driven by a 17% increase in its digital access program. Management expects an increase to 32% in 2025. Healthcare-related volume grew by 5% to $10.5 billion in 2024 and aims to reach $20 billion by 2026. Furthermore, the IT investments resulted in the closure of 11 buildings, and management continues to invest in smart and automated facilities.\n\nFurthermore, as previously discussed, one of the key metrics to follow with UPS is the spread between its revenue per piece (RPP) and its cost per piece (CPP) in its U.S. domestic package segment. For the second quarter running, UPS reported a favorable result.\n\nUPS U.S. Domestic Package Segment First Quarter 2024 Second Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2024 Fourth Quarter 2024 Revenue per piece (0.3)% (2.6)% (2.2)% 2.4% Adjusted cost per piece 4.1% 2.5% (4.1)% 0.9% Spread (4.4 pp) (5.1 pp) 1.9 pp 1.5 pp\n\nWhat it means to UPS investors\n\nFocusing on higher-margin deliveries rather than chasing delivery volume lies at the heart of UPS' \"better not bigger\" approach, and the plan to reduce lower-margin Amazon delivery volumes makes perfect sense. Meanwhile, UPS is demonstrating underlying progress in its strategic objectives (SMBs, healthcare, \"network of the future\") and growing the RPP/CPP spread, which shows confidence that it can hit its targets.\n\nWhile there's no guarantee that UPS will successfully finesse a lowering of Amazon volumes and cut costs smoothly in the process, the trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 14.1 times earnings and a dividend yield of 4.9% gives a good margin of safety, and the stock looks like an excellent value prospect.",

            "content": "Analysts typically recommend targeting dividend yields between 3% and 6%, as this range tends to offer the best balance of potential for both dividend growth and stock price appreciation. A report from Nuveen highlighted that global companies with moderate dividend yields (ranging from 0% to 3%) generally show stronger earnings growth, profitability, and profit margins compared to those with higher yields or no dividends at all. These factors also help reduce risk, particularly in times of market volatility.\n\nThis is a common challenge for investors, who often believe that companies with strong dividend growth don\u2019t offer high yields. However, this isn't necessarily the case. Many companies provide above-average dividend yields while also maintaining solid records of dividend growth. In fact, dividend yield plays an important role in sustaining dividend growth. For example, the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years, has managed to maintain a high yield without sacrificing growth. Over the 26 years ending in 2023, the index consistently outperformed its benchmark while maintaining yields between 2% and 2.9%. On average, the index yielded 2.5%, notably higher than the market average of 1.8%, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nAn example of this is a report from Newton Investment Management, which found that high-yield dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during periods of high inflation between 1940 and 2021. The report also showed that portfolios with high-yield dividend stocks performed better than those with low or no dividends, with high-yield portfolios exceeding low-yield ones by 199 basis points and zero-yield portfolios by 330 basis points. While the findings are insightful, the report lacks details on the specific market conditions during these periods, offering only a general overview of high-yield stock performance. Analysts have closely studied how dividend stocks fare during market volatility, given the heightened need for consistent income. As a result, they recommend considering high-yield stocks only if these companies also demonstrate a solid track record of dividend growth.\n\nDividend investors have often debated the balance between high yields and dividend growth. Analysts tend to favor companies with robust dividend growth, advising investors to avoid the yield traps. However, many studies suggest that high dividend yields aren't necessarily a negative factor.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother study by Wellington Management highlighted the historical outperformance of high-yield stocks. The report analyzed dividend-paying stocks in the broader market index from 1930 to 2019 and grouped them into five categories based on their dividend yields. The top 20% of dividend payers performed the best, followed by the moderate dividend group, both surpassing the broader market in multiple periods. However, the lower dividend groups showed less consistent performance and generally underperformed the index. Given this, we will now take a look at some of the best dividend stocks with over 5% yield.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and picked 12 dividend stocks that have yields above 5%, as of February 5. These companies have strong histories of paying dividends to shareholders. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) the Highest Dividend Stock to Buy on Cash App?\n\nA warehouse filled with boxes of parcels, symbolizing the companies reliable logistics services.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43\n\nDividend Yield as of February 5: 5.83%\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is a Georgia-based shipping and supply chain management company offering its consumers various related services. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company posted revenue of $25.3 billion, which showed a 1.54% growth from the same period last year. The company has reached a preliminary agreement with its largest customer to reduce its volume by over 50% by the second half of 2026. In addition, starting January 1, 2025, it will handle 100% of its UPS SurePost product in-house. As part of these changes, the company is reorganizing its US network and launching multi-year \"efficiency reimagined\" initiatives, aiming to achieve about $1.0 billion in savings through a comprehensive process redesign.\n\nIn addition to delivering strong earnings, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is focusing on growing its healthcare logistics services with the goal of becoming a global leader in this area. In January 2025, it successfully acquired Frigo-Trans and its subsidiary BPL, enhancing UPS's capacity to provide complete temperature-controlled logistics solutions, particularly in Europe.\n\nArtisan Partners highlighted the company\u2019s strengths in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cWe made no new purchases in Q3. Instead, our purchase activity was focused on adding to a few of our existing names that remain cheap, such as Dollar General and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). When we initiated our position in UPS in late 2023, shares were under pressure due to concerns about its new labor contract diverting volumes and driving up costs, as well as the continued normalization of volumes following COVID-related gains. We welcomed the market\u2019s short-term focus as it provided us an opportunity to purchase UPS at an undemanding valuation of less than 11X our view of normalized earnings. UPS is a good transport operation that easily earns its cost of capital, generates significant free cash, has a wide economic moat, has a strong financial profile and pays an attractive dividend\u2014now yielding 4.8%. More recently, the stock has been weak because profits came in weaker than expected. UPS\u2019 customers traded down to the lower yielding ground segment, which negatively impacted overall pricing and margins. These shifts are common and occur in both directions, but what is important, in our view, is the long-term trend of volume growth remains intact. Nevertheless, investors have lost patience with UPS after a string of earnings disappointments.\u201d\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is popular among income investors because of its strong dividend history and stable balance sheet. In FY24, the company generated $10.1 billion in operating cash flow and its free cash flow amounted to $6.3 billion. Moreover, the company returned $5.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This cash position enabled it to raise its payouts for 22 consecutive years, which makes UPS one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share and has a dividend yield of 5.83%, as of February 5.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 indicated that 43 hedge funds owned stakes in United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), compared with 44 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.66 billion.\n\nOverall UPS ranks 3rd on our list of the best dividend stocks with over 5% yield. While we acknowledge the potential for UPS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "In the two days since President Trump enacted new tariffs on goods from China, none of the major US shipping companies and couriers have yet announced detailed policies on new fees, though some have warned of possible delays and disruption. Despite that, both senders and recipients are already reporting being asked to pay import taxes and handling charges.\n\nTrump introduced a ten percent tariff on goods imported from China on Tuesday, but the bigger change is the removal of the \u2018de minimis\u2019 exemption, which previously allowed shipments valued below $800 to avoid all import taxes and duties. The change means that previously duty-free shipments now incur the new ten percent tariff, all prior import taxes, and potentially additional fees charged by the shipping company for the inconvenience. With 1.6 billion shipments into the US under de minimis in 2024, though not all from China, that\u2019s a lot of parcels that now require additional inspections, handling, and paperwork.\n\nSo far, couriers have avoided publishing official guidance on what senders and recipients should expect. The US Postal Service briefly suspended accepting any packages from China or Hong Kong on Tuesday, retracting the decision less than a day later. The service now only warns of \u201cdisruption\u201d to deliveries and that it is working on \u201can efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs.\u201d\n\nUPS similarly warns that shipments to the US from China and Hong Kong \u201cmay experience delays.\u201d The company has suspended its Service Guarantee for deliveries from those countries to the US until further notice, meaning it won\u2019t commit to making deliveries within a set time frame. It says \u201ccontingency plans\u201d are in place to help keep deliveries on schedule.\n\nFedEx has made no public statement on the risk of delays or likely charges, only telling Bloomberg that shipments are continuing between China and the US.\n\nSo far, DHL is the only major courier to discuss fees, admitting to Bloomberg that \u201cthere may be additional time and fees involved in sending items.\u201d Those charges appear to have already begun reaching consumers, with multiple people claiming to have received payment requests for import duties and handling fees from DHL. Keyboard company Qwertykeys has even announced a 72-hour suspension of its own shipments out of China, claiming that DHL \u201cnow requires prepayment of 50% of the declared product value as a tariff deposit, plus a $21 processing fee per package.\u201d Qwertykeys says it is hoping to negotiate with DHL for \u201cfairer tariff-handling solutions.\u201d\n\nRetailers that use Shein and Temu, two of the e-commerce sites that made heavy use of the de minimis exemption to ship goods directly to US consumers, also report being asked to pay tariff deposits. Bloomberg reports that Chinese retailers have been asked to pay a deposit worth 30 percent of the value of goods bound for the US and warned that actual customs charges may be even higher.\n\nJust because logistics companies haven\u2019t announced charges yet doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t apply them, and it\u2019s ultimately consumers that are likely to pay the price. Oxford Economics research last year on two similar bills to reduce China\u2019s access to the de minimis exemption estimated a 40-55 percent increase in end prices for consumers, in addition to substantial new costs for US Customs and Border Protection.",

And his Season 11 \"The Stand-Ups\" sketch is among the gems of that era.\n\nRELATED: Tom Hanks Is President of SNL's \"Mr. Belvedere Fan Club\"\n\nIn the sketch, two stand-ups (Hanks and Lovitz) converse backstage at comedy club Carol's \u2014 likely a play on the venue Caroline's on Broadway \u2014 and it soon becomes clear that everything they say to each other is a Jerry Seinfeld-style bit, peppering their small-talk with \"I mean, hey\" and \"what's the deal?\" They even sport classically Seinfeld-ian outfits: button-down, square tie, and blue jeans.\n\n\"Hey, Keith Matt: I hate to interrupt, but look at this,\" Hanks says amid Lovitz's exchange with a third comic (Damon Wayans), holding up a carton. \"Ninety-nine percent fat-free milk. Where's the other one percent? I mean hey! Back to your story!\" Even serious news gets the jokey-delivery treatment, including news of a colleague's kidney disease.\n\nHanks told the story behind \"The Stand-Ups\" on David Spade and Dana Carvey's Fly on the Wall podcast in 2022. The recurring sketch was conceived by longtime SNL writer Robert Smigel, who had just joined the show that year. On the podcast, Hanks deemed Smigel an \"absolute genius\" as he explained its premise, and shared that they'd cleared a bit about socks with Seinfeld himself ahead of air.\n\nTom Hanks called Jerry Seinfeld to ask permission for a joke in SNL's \"Stand-Ups\" sketch\n\nAs Hanks recalled on Fly on the Wall, Smigel told him that he'd written a sketch that skewers the way comics talk onstage. \"He wrote in a joke that was like, 'hey: what's the deal with socks?,'\" he said.\n\nBut per Hanks, cast member Dennis Miller \u2014 himself a seasoned stand-up comic by the time he arrived at Studio 8H, and a longtime friend of Seinfeld's according to the New York Times \u2014 told them, \"Hey man, that's that's Jerry Seinfeld's material. You can't take that from him.' He was adamant.\"\n\nBecause of Miller's passion, \"we called Jerry Seinfeld,\" Hanks continued.\n\nTom Hanks, Jon Lovitz and Damon Wayans during \"The Stand-Ups\" sketch on Saturday Night Live Season 11, Episode 5. Photo: NBC\n\n\"I'd never met him, but you know, we're in the famous people's club: 'Hey, you're famous, I'm famous, so we can talk to each other like we know each other,'\" Hanks joked. After explaining the sketch, Hanks told Seinfeld, \"but if you're still doing the sock bit, we'll come up with some other jokes.\"\n\nHanks said Seinfeld told him that he \"really appreciated the call,\" confirmed that he had in fact retired the socks joke, and gave \"The Stand-Ups\" his blessing, \"which was very gracious.\" And thus, the socks bit made it into the sketch.\n\nRELATED: All About Tom Hanks on SNL\n\n\"The Stand-Ups\" aired during Tom Hanks' first SNL episode\n\nWhile the December 14, 1985 episode was the future Five-Timers Club member SNL debut, Carvey said on Fly on the Wall that he always remembered Hanks as a Host who \"felt like a cast member to me.\"\n\n\"The first time I did it, I was wickedly excited. The second time I did it, I wasn't very good at all,\" Hanks replied (definitely selling himself short). By his third time, he said, \"I knew what not to do, how to save your energy, and how to participate.\"",

            "content": "Having Twins Ups the Risk of CVD Over the Next Year\n\nFemale patients who deliver twins vs singletons are more apt to return to the hospital for CVD, especially during the first month.\n\nWomen who give birth to twins, regardless of whether they have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), are more likely to be readmitted to the hospital with CVD complications within 1 year than those who give birth to just one baby, according to nationwide US data spanning 2010 to 2020.\n\nWithout HDP, the risk of readmission after twins doubled\u2014with HPD, however, that risk spiked by eightfold. All-cause mortality also was higher after twin versus singleton pregnancies.\n\nThe researchers were \u201castounded\u201d by the degree to which readmissions were elevated for mothers of twins, said senior author Cande V. Ananth, PhD, MPH (Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ). \u201cThese risks are pretty much off the charts.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s known that preeclampsia and other adverse pregnancy outcomes can put women at risk for developing cardiovascular disease decades later, an \u201cunanswered question is what happens to the obstetrical complications in terms of cardiovascular health in the immediate postpartum period,\u201d said Ananth.\n\nEvents that occur in the year after pregnancy are often overlooked, he told TCTMD. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely crucial window. Typically women deliver and they come back for a postpartum visit at about 6 weeks,\u201d then may not return for care until they get pregnant again.\n\nThe issue is of particular relevance given the rise in use of assistive reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), known to disproportionally result in multiple gestation pregnancies, Ananth added. Even without multiples, IVF has been linked to higher risk of CV complications.\n\nFor clinicians, the new findings present multiple opportunities along the care continuum, not just for twin pregnancies but also for singletons, an editorial notes.\n\nAlexandria F. Williams, MD, MPH, Anne Marie Valente, MD, and Katherine E. Economy, MD (Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston, MA), point out that the highest risk of all-cause mortality in this study was seen among patients with HDP who had just one baby. \u201cThis stresses the importance of implementing further interventions to reduce maternal and pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity among all birthing people,\u201d they write.\n\nThese risks are pretty much off the charts. Cande V. Ananth\n\nThrough team-based collaboration among specialists, \u201cwe must embrace the fourth trimester (12 weeks after delivery) as a critical time period to make impactful changes that will influence long-term cardiovascular health,\u201d they urge.\n\nLed by Ruby Lin, MD (Rutgers University), the paper was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.\n\nHypertensive Disorders Pose Extra Risk\n\nFor the study, Lin, Ananth, and colleagues turned to the Nationwide Readmissions Database of US hospitals to collect rates of CVD readmission from 2010 to 2020 for four groups: women with or without HDP (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, or superimposed preeclampsia) who delivered twins or singletons.\n\nOut of 36 million deliveries, 1.8% were twin births. Nearly a quarter (23.1%) of the pregnancies resulting in twins were affected by HDP, as compared with 10.4% of singleton pregnancies, and the prevalence of HDP rose over the 11-year study period. Overall, the mothers of twins with HDP tended to be older and have pregnancies that involved treatment for infertility.\n\nIn the year after giving birth, the rates of CVD readmission were 1,105.5 per 100,000 in patients who had twins and 734.1 per 100,000 in those who had singletons. Risks of readmission were higher after twin pregnancies with and without HDP, and in singleton pregnancies with HDP, than after singleton pregnancies unaffected by HDP. The added risk was seen mainly within the 30 days after delivery and then decreased progressively up to 1 year.\n\nCVD Readmission Risk \u2264 1 Year After Delivery for Patients With vs Without HPD\n\nAdjusted HR 95% CI Singleton \u2013 \u2013 Singleton + HDP 5.89 5.70-6.08 Twins 1.95 1.75-2.17 Twins + HDP 8.21 7.48-9.01\n\n\n\nFor twin pregnancies with HDP, adjusted risks of readmission were particularly elevated for hypertensive heart disease (HR 32.39), heart failure (HR 18.52), and cardiomyopathy (HR 12.19) in comparison to singleton pregnancies without HDP. Additionally, both twin and singleton pregnancies that involved HDP were more likely to result in readmission for stroke than singleton pregnancies without the disorders (HR 5.37 and 6.27, respectively), as were\u2014to a lesser but still significant degree\u2014twin pregnancies without HDP (HR 1.38).\n\nThe risk of all-cause death in the year postpartum, when compared with singleton pregnancies without HDP, was highest after singleton pregnancies with HDP but also elevated after twin pregnancies with the disorders (HR 2.38 and 1.94).\n\nWhile this population-based study doesn\u2019t address the mechanism driving the added risk with twins, the literature does hint at possibilities, the researchers say.\n\n\u201cFirst, the underlying cause of preeclampsia in patients with multifetal pregnancy could be more specific to pregnancy itself, such as higher demand on the cardiovascular system from increased stress from larger placenta burden, rather than the preexisting CVD risk factors that predispose a patient to preeclampsia and future CVD complications,\u201d they write. \u201cSecond, multifetal pregnancies that result in live births may tend to occur in patients who, at baseline, are healthy or have access to medical care.\u201d\n\nTo get to the bottom of this, though, would require mechanistic studies of \u201cwhat is happening at the cellular level, molecular level, and the genetic basis for these associations,\u201d Ananth noted, adding that possible explanations for the relationship between twin pregnancies and CV risk include the underlying burdens posed by comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and thyroid dysfunction) and stress.\n\nAnanth told TCTMD that their research is ongoing. Future work will look more deeply into HDP\u2019s impact on singleton pregnancies, the varying risks posed by the individual conditions that fall under the umbrella of HDP, as well as the trajectory of CV complications and mortality in the first 5 years after delivery.\n\nAs for clinical takeaways, Anath emphasized that preconception counseling is helpful for patients with existing CV risk factors who are undergoing infertility treatment.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the editorialists note, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u201crecommends that twin and higher order gestations have increased maternal and fetal surveillance including close monitoring of blood pressure, maternal weight gain, maternal nutrition, and fetal well-being.\u201d\n\nThen, after delivery, opportunities to improve care include postpartum BP monitoring, use of telehealth and other technologies for remote care, and expanded insurance coverage to enable better follow-up, they suggest.",

Barrel House Cafe & Bar is easy to find, with patrons literally walking through the doors of its huge namesake to enter the 14th Street building (1341 14th Street NW).\n\nIts final form will honor the historic shop that survived everything from riots to political drama in the nation\u2019s capital for almost 100 years, with pictures of the original liquor store (which moved next door in 2015) and boozy decor throughout the space. \u201cWe just thought it was such an iconic location, and we want to be kind of the next chapter of that space,\u201d co-owner Biva Ranjeet told Eater. D.C.\u2019s own Little Miner Taco will supply all the food in the new bar.\n\nFor now, the space will phase through a few fun pop-ups. A holiday one called Tinsel and Tonic first appeared in December. The cozy, alpine-themed Lodge took over Barrel House in January. In late February, Shamrock Shack will pop up just in time for St. Patrick\u2019s Day with Irish-themed cocktails and Irish whiskies. Next will be cherry blossom-themed Sakura in March and the fairy garden-themed Pixie Hollow in mid-April. Then Barrel House plans to close up shop for a few months to renovate, reopening in September with a final cocktail menu and decorations that will be more permanent.\n\nDolcezza opens a new location for the first time in six years\n\nAffogato fans, rejoice. D.C.-based Dolcezza opens its sixth area gelato and coffee shop in mid-March at the foot of the Apollo apartments (600 H Street NE). Alongside the 20-flavor gelato menu, pastries from Pluma Bakery, and coffee from Unido that are served at every Dolcezza, the new location will also roll out a new soft serve option with two rotating flavors. The opening will feature creamy new flavors of pistachio, made locally with stone-milled pistachio butter, and dulce de leche, a nod to co-founder Violeta Edelman\u2019s Argentine background, but there are plenty more soft serve flavors coming soon, like lemon meringue, sambayon (an Italian custard popularized in Argentina), and single-origin chocolate. The owners also announced that another location will be opening by the end of 2025.\n\nA Japanese take on Philly cheesesteaks at Tonari\n\nChinatown\u2019s wafu-Italian eatery Tonari rolls out a new Monday special on February 10 called \u201cKat\u2019s King of Suteki,\u201d where chef and co-owner Katsuya Fukushima will be serving up ch\u012bzu-sut\u0113ki, Philly-style cheesesteaks, with plenty of unconventional optional toppings and sides. Turning the regional dish on its head, the sandwich is filled with beef and onions slowly simmered in a sweet dashi broth, made with kombu, shoyu, and mirin. You can add deep-fried shishito peppers, different sauces, au jus for dipping, and a variety of cheeses (cheese whiz, provolone, sharp cheddar, or American cheese) to the rich sandwich and even order a side of nori or curry fries (also with optional cheese whiz). If you\u2019re more partial to the classic Japanese gyudon, the beef and onion rice bowl that inspired Fukushima\u2019s sandwich, those comforting bowls will be available (and customizable) on Mondays at Tonari as well. 707 6th Street NW\n\nReverie caters to carnivores now, too\n\nNearly a year after Michelin-starred Reverie rose from the ashes in Georgetown with a seafood-centric reboot, chef Johnny Spero introduces lamb and other game meats for the first time tonight. While \u201cthe heart of Reverie will always be the ocean,\u201d he says, the idea is to \u201cbring a different kind of richness and texture to the menu.\u201d His 16-course modernist meals continue to draw culinary influences and techniques from Nordic countries, Japan, and Spero\u2019s native Maryland.

            "content": "By Eliza Schultz and Bill Aiman\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 On Thursday January 30, UPS announced a major cutback in Amazon package deliveries, with the goal of dropping over 50% of the volume from the company\u2019s largest customer by June 2026. In conjunction, UPS is looking to permanently shutter 10% of buildings, shrink their fleet of vehicles and lay off workers.\n\nThe plan to close more buildings comes on the heels of the hard fought 2023 Teamsters contract, which resulted in major wage gains for part-timers and the end of the 2-tier system among package car drivers. The credible threat of a strike forced UPS to concede to the union\u2019s demands in contract negotiations and look elsewhere for cost savings. Last year UPS laid off 12,000 corporate employees and announced major investments in the automation of hub operations as part of their \u201cNetwork of the Future\u201d initiative.\n\n\u201cWhen UPS closes hubs for renovations, they are laying the groundwork for mass layoffs due to automation,\u201d said Alex Carson, a part-time unloader out of Atlanta. \u201cWorkers whose hubs get closed for over a year are given the option to drive to nearby hubs, which is untenable for most, as it can add hours to commutes. This allows UPS to effectively conceal how many people actually lose their job due to automation.\u201d\n\nDespite leading the industry with $8.5 billion in profit last year, UPS is being driven by its Wall Street owners to push profits even higher. Under CEO Carol Tome\u2019s \u201cBetter not Bigger\u201d strategy, UPS has instituted numerous rate hikes and shifted focus from e-commerce to higher revenue segments like small business and medical. UPS hopes that reducing operations will free up $1 billion in capital which can be reinvested in higher margin sectors requiring less labor. UPS has been making big purchases in healthcare warehousing and logistics, for example the recent acquisition of Europe-based Frigo-Trans and BPL.\n\n\u201cThis is why it\u2019s so important that our union continue to put a lot of resources towards organizing Amazon workers,\u201d said Jenny Bekenstein, UPS Teamster and Amazon organizer out of Los Angeles. \u201cBecause of how the companies are in competition with each other in the industry and how UPS has the power to downsize or automate if it wants to, our jobs and all of the good things that we fought for in our UPS contract are not safe until we organize Amazon workers to have the same thing and set a real industry standard in logistics that these companies can\u2019t get around.\u201d\n\nAutomation and a smaller workforce at UPS make organizing Amazon an existential question for the Teamsters. The growth of Amazon as a non-union, independent delivery service puts competitive pressure on UPS to continue with automation and layoffs. UPS is the largest Teamster employer and job cuts will weaken the union.\n\nThe growth of a militant rank-and-file movement makes the Teamsters well poised to fight back against any job eliminations at UPS. Additionally, some drivers and warehouse workers at Amazon have joined the Teamsters in demanding higher wages and better working conditions. By the end of 2024, Amazon had become the largest private delivery business in the U.S., moving nearly 6 billion packages. This past holiday season also saw the first national Amazon strike with Teamsters walking out in California, Georgia, Illinois and New York.\n\n#ChicagoIL #IL #Labor #Teamsters #UPS #Automation",

The new fund will increase Hitachi\u2019s ability to invest in generative AI startups, said Keiji Kojima, the company\u2019s president and CEO.\n\n\u201cHitachi\u2019s efforts in CVC, which began in 2019 with US$150m, have expanded to US$1bn in five years, driven in part by the disruptive innovation brought about by generative AI,\u201d Kojima said.\n\nHitachi joins a small but growing number of companies that have allocated more than $1bn to corporate venture investments in the past few years. According to the most recent GCV Keystone global benchmarking survey, just 7% of corporate venture units have assets under management of this size. Many companies that have beefed up their investment allocation have done so specifically to invest in AI.\n\nStefan Gabriel, CEO and managing director of Hitachi Ventures (pictured above) said: \u201cWhile topping up our [assets under management] to $1bn, Hitachi Ventures will be able to keep the speed of venture investing in future unicorns of fast changing growth markets in upcoming (new) regions that create strategic and technical relevance for Hitachi\u2019s businesses.\u201d\n\nHitachi Ventures operates from four hubs in Munich, Silicon Valley, Boston and India. Gabriel told Global Corporate Venturing that the new fund would allow Hitachi to deepen involvement in India. India has been a growing focus for a number of corporate investors in the past year with companies such as Amazon and Jaguar Land Rover increasing investment focus in the country.\n\nAI-related investments will be a strong theme for the new fund, with Hitachi highlighting data centers, distributed energy systems, future of work and industrial AI as focus areas. In addition the fund will invest in other frontier technologies, including bio, quantum, nuclear fusion, life science, space and adjacent technologies.\n\nIn the five years since it was set up Hitachi Ventures has invested in 38 startup portfolio companies, including more than five that have \u201cunicorn\u201d valuations of more than $1bn. The unicorns in the Hitachi Ventures portfolio include Ascend Elements, Weka, Arsenal Biosciences, and Rescale.\n\nAround half of the portfolio companies are working with Hitachi\u2019s business units, including AI and data platform Makersite, carbon dioxide removal company Captura, and Archetype AI, which provides AI foundational models and applications for real-world sensor data.",

            "content": "Looking at Melcor Developments Ltd.'s (TSE:MRD ) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net buyers. That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Melcor Developments\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Melcor Developments\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when CEO & Executive Chairman Timothy Melton bought CA$351k worth of shares at a price of CA$11.70 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of CA$12.56. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Melcor Developments insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. Timothy Melton was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.\n\nTimothy Melton purchased 35.60k shares over the year. The average price per share was CA$11.81. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nTSX:MRD Insider Trading Volume February 5th 2025\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nMelcor Developments Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw some Melcor Developments insider selling. The selling netted CA$119k for insiders. But at least we saw CA$70k worth of buying. While it's not great to see insider selling, the net amount sold isn't enough for us to want to read anything into it.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Melcor Developments\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Melcor Developments insiders own 13% of the company, worth about CA$52m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Melcor Developments Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nOur data shows a little more insider selling than buying in the last three months. But the difference is small, and thus, not concerning. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Insiders own shares in Melcor Developments and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Our analysis shows 5 warning signs for Melcor Developments (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.",

            "content": "Credit: Brilliant Planet\n\nOn the barren coast of Akhfenir, Morocco, a nature-based solution to the climate crisis is taking shape. Raffael Jovine is building an oblong, mechanically stirred pool full of pea-green water. He claims it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest \u201calgal raceway pond.\u201d Bordered by desert on one side and cold ocean currents on the other, this seemingly inhospitable land is where Jovine found the perfect algal strains to capture carbon dioxide.\n\nJovine, the cofounder and chief scientist of Brilliant Planet, is trying to engineer high-growth microalgae strains to capture and bury carbon as biomass in the ground for 1,000 years. In August 2023, the company achieved a breakthrough by growing enough algae to fill 77 Olympic-size swimming pools in just a month.\n\n\u201cThese locally sourced marine organisms are fast growers even in extreme conditions,\u201d Jovine says. \u201cThey grow like weeds and can sequester up to 50 times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per hectare per year than a typical temperate forest.\u201d\n\nAfter incorporating carbon, these engineered algae are propelled to the top of a 10-story tower. Once sprayed into the desert air, the biomass dries into a flurry of hypersaline flakes in less than 30 s. The flakes are collected and buried underground, entombing any carbon they\u2019ve consumed.\n\nThis is more than an exercise in sustainability. Brilliant Planet\u2019s facility generates carbon credits that the company has already sold to the tech giant Block to offset 1,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2027.\n\nJovine isn\u2019t alone in believing that algae hold the key to our climate future. He\u2019s part of a growing wave of start-ups that see algae as a multipronged solution for capturing carbon dioxide, mopping up pollution, and cleaning water supplies. Funding for these companies is mounting, but they still have to find ways to work around natural algae\u2019s biological and commercial limitations. Using genetic engineering and advanced growth techniques, they\u2019re creating high-quality algal strains that push past these obstacles.\n\nAlgae for carbon capture\n\nWhat makes algae so attractive is their biochemistry. They can grow 10 times as fast as terrestrial plants, produce 70% of Earth\u2019s oxygen, and capture up to 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per acre daily. But making a business out of algae isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds. Their short lifespan, dietary needs, and susceptibility to contamination make turning a profit on algae products difficult.\n\nFor example, Jovine says, algae can be so finicky that it\u2019s not uncommon for them to fail after 12 min in field tests for biofuel production. The reason for that is \u201coutdated algal strains that have been sitting on the university shelf for the last 120 years,\u201d he says.\n\nRather than use established strains that have been adapted to grow in a lab under \u201cdingy lights,\u201d as Jovine puts it, Brilliant Planet starts with algae native to Morocco and grows them in the open air. The company then optimizes culture parameters like temperature and light, as well as individual nutrients such as nitrogen, silicate, and iron, to coax cells to grow faster and capture more CO 2 than they could naturally.\n\nTo get its operation working, Jovine\u2019s team had to devise a way to keep pH levels in its ponds in check. When the algae pond is filled with ocean water, it begins with an acidic pH, a product of CO 2 emissions in the air dissolving into the ocean and turning into carbonic acid. As the algae gobble up those acidic compounds the water\u2019s pH starts to rise. That shift creates carbonate, which the algae can\u2019t use to grow. To avoid carbonate production, Brilliant Planet injects more CO 2 into the pond, feeds the algae a diet that acidifies their water, and raises or lowers the system\u2019s stirring speed.\n\nDialing in these parameters allows algae to grow 300,000 cells per milliliter, up from their natural density of 20,000\u201330,000. In addition, Brilliant Planet\u2019s technology has a knock-on effect of deacidifying the ocean. After the water runs through the algae pond, the company returns the water to the ocean without the carbonic acid. The facility neutralizes so much acid that \u201cfor every unit of ocean water we bring in, we deacidify about 5.1 units,\u201d Jovine says.\n\nBrilliant Planet is scaling up its project faster than many efforts for direct air capture (DAC) of CO 2 have managed. For one, algae-based projects have the benefit of deriving much of their energy inputs from the sun. But another big part of their success comes from circumventing the energetic penalty that comes with collecting scattered carbon dioxide molecules from the environment: DAC tries to nab CO 2 molecules floating in the air and stuff them into a solid sorbent; corralling and holding on to all those molecules requires a significant energy input.\n\nAlgae skip this expensive energy trap because their photosynthetic cells use the sun\u2019s energy to actively transport CO 2 or bicarbonate across their cellular membranes. Overall, algae-based carbon capture can cost 20\u201325% as much as DAC.\n\nBacked by more than $25 million from companies including Toyota Ventures and Pegasus Tech Ventures, Brilliant Planet has completed its pilot project and is moving to build a 70,000 m2 demonstration site that will be able to slurp up 100 tons of CO 2 annually by early 2025. If all goes according to plan, the firm aims to expand this operation into a 14 million m2 commercial facility designed to capture 270,000 tons of CO 2 per year by 2030.\n\nGenetically engineering algae to trap more carbon\n\nOther start-ups have goals similar to those of Brilliant Planet but take a more fundamental approach: genetic engineering. At The Oxford Science Park, CyanoCapture uses altered algal genomes to grow high-metabolism strains of Synechococcus, a genus of cyanobacteria, better known as blue-green algae.\n\nThe start-up employs CRISPR-Cas12a to edit genes tied to carbon-fixing pathways that redirect carbon and use excess electrons created in the chloroplast. One of CyanoCapture\u2019s approaches involves using excess electrons created during photosynthesis more efficiently. The start-up does this by splicing in more genetic pathways that can take advantage of the surplus chemical energy.\n\nAccording to Stuart Reid, chief technology officer at CyanoCapture, the results are impressive. Their strains capture carbon dioxide twice as fast as a model cyanobacteria strain and three times as fast as other algal strains.\n\nThey\u2019re energy efficient as well. While methods like DAC require 2,000 kW h of electricity per ton of CO 2 captured, CyanoCapture\u2019s strains work with a mere 350 kW h. They\u2019re essentially self-sufficient and easily replicate themselves, which minimizes operating costs.\n\nEven though CyanoCapture is still in the pilot phase, it has caught global attention, snagging the Shell New Energy Challenge award, an XPrize grant from the Musk Foundation, and grants from Innovate UK.\n\nA similar effort is taking place in Hong Kong, where rows upon rows of photobioreactors (PBRs) fill ALcarbo Technology\u2019s facility, each of them teeming with green algae and a tailored supply of CO 2 and essential nutrients. These are the breeding grounds for the start-up\u2019s genetically engineered algae that guzzle carbon dioxide at 12 times the fixation rate of wild-type strains.\n\nCredit: ALcarbo Technologies\n\nThe process begins by exposing natural strains of algae to chemical agents and other forms of environmental stressors that induce random mutations in their DNA. This creates a diverse pool of mutants, some of which may have enhanced carbon-fixation abilities. Inside the PBRs, conditions are meticulously controlled to push algae to their limits, maximizing mutation rates while ensuring they can survive and multiply.\n\nBesides genetic mutation, a critical component of ALcarbo\u2019s PBRs are gas bubbles less than 200 nm in diameter dispersed throughout the water in which the algae grow. These nanobubbles contain and enhance the dissolution of gases like CO 2 and oxygen to expedite the growth of mutated strains.\n\nALcarbo then selects the best-performing mutants based on visual traits like growth rate, color, and overall health. The most promising candidates undergo further analysis to home in on the precise genetic features that contribute to the mutants\u2019 superior carbon-fixation abilities. Once those genes are documented, the process begins anew using the top-performing mutants.\n\nWater has often been overlooked in the environmental movement, like the Cinderella of the cause. Mahshid Sedghi, research and development director at the start-up Algaesys\n\n\u201cEven after accounting for the energy used to run and build them, these reactors can still [each] absorb half a ton of carbon dioxide each year,\u201d says Nelson Ng, a cofounder of ALcarbo. The project is in its pilot phase, with 12 photobioreactors installed across 150 m2in Yuen Long, Hong Kong. The company hopes to capture 100 tons of CO 2 per year by next year, which will mean scaling up to over 2,900 bioreactors on an area about half the size of a football field.\n\nIn a world that rewards such research, mitigating climate change is a high-profile and potentially profitable goal, but algae\u2019s environmental applications don\u2019t stop there. The same principle\u2014having algae wolf down molecules that they use to grow\u2014can also be applied to cleaning up water.\n\nSoaking up pollution\n\n\u201cWater has often been overlooked in the environmental movement, like the Cinderella of the cause,\u201d says Mahshid Sedghi, research and development director at the start-up Algaesys. \u201cMany economies take it for granted, but there\u2019s a growing disparity in access to clean water.\u201d\n\nCredit: Algaesys\n\nAt the literal center of the Portugal-based company\u2019s technology are a series of rotating logs, hypnotic as they churn the water running through a trough beneath them. Each roller sports a carpet of growing algae that nabs pollutants each time it dips into the water.\n\nThe algae naturally release sticky polymeric substances that serve as a foundation for biofilms, structured communities of microorganisms. The biofilms clean the water by generating reactive oxygen species that oxidize and break down complex pollutants, including microplastics and heavy metals coming from urban sewage, chemical sites, microelectronics, and industrial parks.\n\nNotably, Sedghi says, Algaesys\u2019s troughs can be deployed at various scales. While the company\u2019s treatment plants in the US, the UK, China, and Australia are powered by large troughs and rollers, the system can be downsized to fit onto trucks for deployment in remote or low-resource areas.\n\n\u201cOur algae-based treatment is designed to address these issues on any scale\u2014whether it\u2019s a domestic rooftop setup or a massive facility handling 100 megaliters of wastewater a day,\u201d Sedghi says. \u201cThis way, we can make water management equitable for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe ingenuity of cleanup systems like this is that some wastewater pollutants actually feed plant cells. For example, runoff from farms that is rich in fertilizer chemicals such as ammonium, nitrate, and phosphorus-containing ions spurs growth in algae reactors.\n\nTake as an example Archimede Ricerche\u2019s facility in Camporosso, Italy. The 11,000 m2 glass building looks like a massive greenhouse full of rippling pools of water; sleek, cylindrical PBRs; and billions of microscopic algae that sustain themselves on nitrogen-contaminated wastewater coming into the plant from the food, beverage, and aquaculture industries.\n\nWhen the wastewater enters the PBRs, the algae get to work, absorbing ammonium and nitrate through their cell membranes and using those nutrients to reproduce and renew their ranks.\n\nOnce the algae have done their job, the water emerges from the reactor cleaner and ready to be reused for numerous applications, including to irrigate nonedible crops or as an industrial coolant. As of now, Archimede\u2019s treatment facility saves 50\u201370% in energy costs for wastewater treatment compared with a standard plant.\n\nChallenges and risks\n\nAlgae aren\u2019t a silver bullet for the world\u2019s environmental ills. For one thing, these projects still need to figure out what to do with the mounting mass of material they grow.\n\nWhile Brilliant Planet buries the algae it sucks out of the ocean and sells off carbon credits, CyanoCapture uses algal strains to absorb and directly convert carbon into compounds of interest. \u201cImagine a power plant in Indonesia needing palmitic acid to replace palm oil in supply chains, or a company in Texas wanting graphite,\u201d Reid says. \u201cWe can tailor our algae to produce exactly what they need.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother option is eating the stuff. Archimede is already selling biomass from its treatment plants as fish feed and as an ingredient in natural cosmetics. Its future plans include developing nutraceuticals for humans.\n\nAs these start-ups try to manipulate and generate profits from these organisms, they\u2019re realizing that information on algae is scarce. The first genome database dedicated to algae was reported only in 2020 (Database, DOI: 10.1093/database/baaa097) and covers a small fraction of the algal world: among the 46,000-plus recognized species, the database contains information on fewer than 2,000.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve been fermenting yeast for 5,000 years, these new and quirky microbes are often poorly understood,\u201d Reid says. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly in flux to find new ways to examine their genetic makeup and make better decisions about cultivation.\u201d\n\nIn devising new ways to capture carbon dioxide, \u201cwe\u2019re caught between tree planting and costly air capture technologies,\u201d Jovine says. \u201cWe need to make algae a financial and social proposition that people can get behind. They\u2019re a natural fix for human-made issues.\u201d",

Understanding how \u201cc-Rel\u201d affects skin inflammation could lead to new treatments, they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study, published recently in eBioMedicine, examined how c-Rel contributes to the function of a type of immune cell\u2014known as dendritic cells (DCs). The study examined how c-Rel responds to specific immunological signals through Toll Like Receptor 7 (TLR7), which regulates innate immunity and inflammation, exacerbating psoriasis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers also found the absence of c-Rel alleviates inflammation that causes red, scaly patches on the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that by focusing on c-Rel and TLR7, scientists might be able to create more targeted treatments that reduce inflammation and help psoriasis symptoms,\u201d said Parameswaran Ramakrishnan, associate professor of pathology, member of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center and researcher at Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, the study\u2019s principal investigator. \u201cThis may help relieve the discomfort millions of people live with skin inflammation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers examined skin samples from psoriasis patients and a mouse model with similar skin changes. They analyzed c-Rel levels and its behavior in specially engineered cells lacking the protein; they also examined the mouse model lacking c-Rel.\n\nWant more breaking news?

A range of viruses that activates TLR7, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), are linked to the development of psoriasis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe research warrants future studies on TLR7-c-Rel-dependent molecular mechanism regulating DC function as a potential link for how viral TLR7 activation is involved in worsening psoriatic disease,\u201d Ramakrishnan said. \u201cFrom a broad perspective, it would be interesting to further explore the role of c-Rel and TLR7 in other biologically relevant diseases involving these proteins, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and wound-healing in diabetes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Liu AR, Sarkar N, Cress JD, et al.

            "content": "President Trump's tariff actions rattled markets.\n\nAfter months of threatening to levy tariffs on imports from countries he blames for facilitating the flood of fentanyl into the U.S., on Saturday, President Donald Trump did just that. He announced the imposition of new 25% tariffs on imports to the U.S. from its top two trading partners, Mexico and Canada. The country's third biggest trading partner, China, got hit with a 10% increase in its tariffs as well.\n\nU.S. stock markets are reacting as you might expect they would, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 600 points (1.4%) as of 10:20 a.m. ET, and the broader S&P 500 off 1.9%. Transportation stocks in particular were taking it on the chin this morning: United Parcel Service (UPS 1.33%) stock is down 3.5% as I write this, Forward Air Corporation (FWRD 5.93%) is off 6.3%, and FedEx shares (FDX 0.51%) are doing worst of all -- down 6.6%. Trump later put a hold on the Mexico tariffs.\n\nTariffs news\n\nThe new tariffs are expected to go into immediate and full effect just after midnight tonight, although energy imports from Canada will get a slight reprieve, being taxed at only 10%. CNBC notes that combined, U.S. trade with the three countries named is worth $1.6 trillion annually, so you might think this means, the tariffs would generate about $400 billion in additional annual revenue for the U.S.\n\nIn fact, the amount will be far lower than that because (1) the $1.6 trillion covers trade in both directions -- but only trade coming into the U.S. would be subject to tariffs, (2) some of the tariffs are at 10%, not 25% and (3), the U.S. importers who are required to pay the import tariffs will probably raise prices to cover their increased cost. Higher prices tend to depress demand, with the result that the volume of trade will decrease, resulting in lower tariff revenue as well.\n\nInvestors are worrying that the higher prices will have a second effect: inflation.\n\nIndeed, higher prices are pretty much the definition of inflation, and inflation was already starting to inch higher again in December, when the inflation rate rose to 2.6%. These new tariffs could make it worse.\n\nWhy tariffs are particularly bad news for UPS, Forward Air, and FedEx\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, FedEx does 72% of its business in the U.S. and UPS gets 79% of its revenues from the U.S. (Forward Air doesn't break down its geographical revenue distribution in this way). So while the two larger companies, at least, have some revenue streams that won't be directly exposed to the tariffs fight, the bulk of their business will be exposed.\n\nIn a pair of ratings moves this morning, Chicago's Loop Capital lowered its price target on UPS stock to $115, and maintained a hold rating on the stock. Loop also downgraded its rating on FedEx stock from buy to hold.\n\nLoop argues that importing companies are adept at updating prices quickly and that when they do raise prices, sales of imported goods will fall. Lower sales will mean fewer goods to sell, and fewer goods that need transportation to their place of sale. Hence, Loop is downgrading the entire U.S. transportation sector today, and UPS and FedEx in particular.\n\nIs it safe to buy UPS, Forward Air, and FedEx stocks?\n\nIn its notes, which were carried on TheFly.com today, Loop points out that the U.S. transportation sector was already in a two-year-long \"freight recession\" before these tariffs went into effect. FedEx earnings were down 11% year over year in its most recent earnings report, while UPS just finished warning that its sales (which grew less than 6% last quarter) will miss analyst forecasts by about 6% this year, shrinking to $89 billion, rather than growing as expected.\n\nA four-way trade war among the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and China -- which many are fearing -- would almost certainly add to investor worries on that score.\n\nThat being said, trade wars eventually end. UPS stock, trading at 17 times earnings today, and paying a dividend yield of nearly 5%, looks attractive to me. Likewise for Forward Air at a valuation of 15 times earnings, despite having a dividend yield of less than 3%. FedEx on the other hand, at 17 times earnings but with only a 2% dividend yield looks relatively less attractive than the others.\n\nInvestors looking to buy into transportation stocks in anticipation of an end to the trade war might consider looking at UPS first, Forward Air next, and FedEx stock last of all. In fact, you might want to start looking into that today, because this situation is changing fast. Just before noon, Trump announced he was putting the Mexico tariffs on hold for a month.",

            "content": "UPS (NYSE: UPS) recently posted its Q4 results, with revenues missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported revenue of $25.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.75 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $25.4 billion and $2.53, respectively. However, the company\u2019s outlook fell short of expectations. UPS plans to lower volumes with Amazon by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. This didn\u2019t sit well with the investors, and the stock dropped 14% on Thursday, January 30.\n\nUPS stock, with -11% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. A softness in shipping volume post-pandemic has weighed on the company\u2019s stock price growth lately. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nHow Did UPS Fare In Q4?\n\nUPS\u2019s revenue of $25.3 billion in Q4 was up 1.5% y-o-y, amid a soft demand environment. Supply Chain Solutions segment sales were down 9.1%, while the U.S. Domestic Package sales were up 2.2% and the International sales rose 6.9%. The company saw its U.S. Domestic average daily package volume decline 0.3%. However, international volume was up 8.8% y-o-y. The average revenue per piece for the U.S. Domestic packages was up 2.4%, but it was down 0.4% for international packages. UPS\u2019s divestiture in Coyote resulted in lower revenue for its supply chain solutions segment.\n\nThe consolidated adjusted operating margin stood at 12.3%. Looking at the bottom line, adjusted EPS rose 11% y-o-y to $2.75 in Q4. Looking forward, UPS expects its 2025 sales to be around $89 billion, much lower than the $95 billion consensus estimate. This can be attributed to the company\u2019s decision to reduce its shipments for Amazon. UPS aims to expand its profitability with this step. It expects operating margin to expand by 100 bps y-o-y to 10.8% in 2025.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For UPS Stock?\n\nAlthough UPS posted better than expected earnings in Q4, its stock is weighed down amid a top-line miss and downbeat outlook. Even if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the performance of UPS stock with respect to the index over the last four-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 30% in 2021, -15% in 2022, -6% in 2023, and -16% in 2024.\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and geopolitical tensions, could UPS face a similar situation as it did in 2023 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for UPS to reflect the latest results, we think UPS stock now has ample room for growth. At its current levels of $115, UPS trades at under 15x trailing earnings, versus the stock\u2019s average P/E ratio of 17x over the last five years. Although a cut in sales outlook amid reduced Amazon shipments does impact the company\u2019s top-line, an improvement in profitability should bode well for its earnings growth in the long run.

            "content": "WWE\n\nThe 2025 edition of the Royal Rumble is in the books, and it undoubtedly will be the topic of conversation for the next several days after two very different winners in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Rumbles.\n\nOn the women\u2019s side, you have a 14-time world champion and perennial favorite, a person who no one in their right mind would have bet against, simply because she always finds a way to be in the championship mix. For the men, there was a multitude of serious contenders with detailed storylines that would be fulfilled if they won, setting off an entertaining path to WrestleMania. Instead, WWE took a left turn with the winner, a fan favorite who will be a significant underdog no matter whom he challenges. The decision raises questions of whether the company made a flash change in plans given recent booking, and it could complicate the path to WrestleMania.\n\nThe women\u2019s Rumble dragged for large parts until the waning moments, whereas the men\u2019s Rumble flowed well early and slowed down significantly as the bigger names came out in the latter half. One major problem that is difficult to counter, is the long walkway means that most of the intervals between wrestlers are eaten up during entrances, leaving fans to watch an entrance, see 30-45 seconds of action, and then count down for the next superstar.\n\nHuge kudos are due to Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens, who delivered a ladder match that didn\u2019t rely on an overdone, constantly escalating amount of prop-based violence. They amped up the physicality and used ladders to punctuate the fight, but it ramped up steadily rather than throwing someone off a 20-foot ladder through a table stack as a transition spot.\n\nOverall, the kickoff to the Road to WrestleMania did its job setting the table for several matches that will advance during the next couple of months, and even the question marks could be turned into exclamation points by the time April rolls around.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it\u2026",

            "content": "There's nothing like a full house at a high school basketball game. It adds to the excitement and teams love playing in that atmosphere. But it seems lately that a select few are ruining the experience.\n\nIn the last few days, there has been a spate of fans being ejected from the games. In the Oak Hill-Boothbay girls' game on January 31, eight fans were ejected with one parent storming the court. In Saturday's Old Town-Caribou boys' game 1 fan was ejected. In the Erskine Academy - Medomak Valley Girl's game on January 30th another fan was ejected.\n\nThe Maine Principal's Association even put out a press release reminding fans about the need for good sportsmanship\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of high school sports, we need to talk. When you\u2019re at the game, do you lose control? If so, everyone sees it\u2014the teachers, the officials, the other fans, the parents, and most importantly, the student-athletes. They see you at your worst. And it leaves and impression\u2014not just of you and the school but all Maine high school athletics.\n\nResearch consistently underscores that kids look to adults as inspiration for who they want to be and how they want to live. That\u2019s because adults set the tone. Adults show what behaviors are acceptable and what aren\u2019t. Adults mold perceptions of what it is to be good and bad, and adults pass down the tools to help tell the difference. So, ask yourself, what difference are you creating? And what molds are you setting? When you\u2019re around kids, do you act like a role model? Are you on your best behavior, knowing that your actions have an impact? Or do you see watchful eyes fixed on you and think this is my moment? The effect you have on young minds is beyond measure. It\u2019s deep and lasting, and it\u2019s up to you to make it positive. Maine high school athletics are a place for positivity. They\u2019re a place for encouragement and growth where young people should feel safe to find themselves, learn from their mistakes, and excel. Negativity and bad behavior, on the other hand, stop growth in its tracks. They erode confidence, shrink identity and eat away at esteem until nothing is left. Our student-athletes deserve better. Our student-athletes deserve your support, understanding and a pledge to lead by example. We must show them what it means to keep your cool, especially when facing adversity. It\u2019s an essential life skill and one that often takes a lifetime to learn. So, let\u2019s start now. At the next game, when the stakes get high and tensions rise, what impression will you leave? Simmer down or sit down. Let\u2019s show them how its\u2019 done.\n\nBenchBadBehavior.com Visit #BenchBadBehavior to join themovement. At every game I broadcast there is a statement read reminding fans about the need for Good Sportsmanship, but it seems like it's going through one ear and out the other by some. There is a desperate need for officials in all sports, but let's face it, who wants to be an umpire or referee when you have fans screaming at them, and obscenities being lobbed in their direction and fans storming the court?\n\nSo I'm proposing the following\n\nIf a fan gets tossed, they are escorted out of the school. They are not allowed to attend any more games not only for the rest of that sport season, but for the rest of the school year. Get tossed out in Football season, you'll miss basketball and baseball/softball seasons. Get tossed in Basketball...You'll miss the Spring Sport Season. This goes for home and away contests. I know it will be hard to enforce at away games, but it can be enforced. If it occurs at a basketball game, there is an immediate technical foul called and the opposing team will shoot 2 free throws and have the basketball. And here's perhaps the most radical suggestion, if it's a parent of a player, that player has to leave the game. The coach will be forced to bench him/her for the rest of the game.\n\nNow referees/umpires shouldn't have rabbit ears. But they shouldn't have to put up with the abuse they're experiencing. I was lucky enough to broadcast basketball games during COVID, when fans were not allowed in the gyms. That was horrible. Games shouldn't have to be played in a sterile environment, but so is the current situation when fans are being ejected.\n\nThese are high school games when 13 to 18 year olds are playing. This isn't the end of the world. Imagine if people were yelling at you while you were at work. Mistakes happen... players and referees/umpires are not perfect. They are doing their best. If you think you can do better, take a course, become an official. As a matter of fact there's an umpire class starting soon.\n\nHigh School Basketball Tournaments are starting soon. It would be terrible if there needed to be a buffer around the court because of fan behavior and fans were not allowed to sit close to the court. Before you go to the next game, please remember to exhibit good sportsmanship in the stands. Make the players on the court be proud of you!",

Hatsune Miku, Tanjiro Kamado and Labubu aren\u2019t household names in the UK, but collectible figurines and merchandise based on manga, anime and video games, are some of the biggest sellers for the British toy industry.\n\nCollectibles \u2013 ornamental toys sold with the objective of collecting a definable set \u2013 are now a \u00a3510m sector in the UK, according to research by the British Toy & Hobby Association and Circana.\n\nMerchandise from big entertainment franchises isn\u2019t new \u2013 Star Wars figurines were hugely profitable in the 1970s, and many toy boxes in the 1980s were stuffed with Care Bears \u2013 but this new wave of collectibles has found a wider audience.\n\nMany collectors are adults and the range is heavily influenced by China and Japan. The most popular characters are from manga and anime, and toys are often sold from vending machines or in \u201cblind boxes\u201d where the package doesn\u2019t reveal which set lies within.\n\nThe artists creating these collectibles are often as important as the characters. Some artists produce sets of collectibles that reimagine well-known pop-culture franchises such as Harry Potter or Mickey Mouse. More and more traditional companies such as Disney are collaborating with collectibles artists and stores.\n\nView image in fullscreen Pop star Hatsune Miku, a vocaloid avatar who is a popular collectible Photograph: Heo UK\n\n\u201cNetflix brought anime to a wide audience,\u201d said Tom Pelly, managing director of Heo (UK), an international distributor of collectibles. \u201cThey licensed a lot of the popular shows like One Piece and My Hero Academia. They were dubbed into English. Anime really took off in the mainstream in the UK during the pandemic, when people were stuck at home.\u201d\n\nA dedicated anime streaming platform called Crunchyroll has more than 15 million subscribers worldwide and is popular with UK viewers.\n\nThe Heo stand at the London Toy Fair featured new figurine releases of pop star Hatsune Miku, an avatar created for a voice synthesiser, who is incredibly popular on the international market as a collectible. She now appears in the video game Fortnite.\n\nWhile many collectible characters have arrived in the UK via streaming and social media platforms, more and more bricks-and-mortar shops are opening to cater for collectors. Japanese video game company Bandai Namco is the second most valuable toy brand in the world \u2013 beaten only by Lego. A Bandai Namco Cross store opened in Camden Market, London, in 2023. Fans can buy collectibles from vending machines there (known as Gashapon) and tickets to try to win rare collectibles (Ichibankuji).\n\nCiaran Chivers-Procter, collector and hobby brand manager at Bandai UK, said the rise of events such as MCM Comic Con and expos for collectors has helped collectibles enter the mainstream, and that lower-priced products have helped them to reach new audiences.\n\nTwo Chinese chains have made a big impact in the UK. MiniSo sells collectibles alongside Asian brands of makeup, homewares and plushies. The brand first opened a British store in 2019 but now has 29 sites across the UK.\n\nPop Mart \u2013 which is dedicated to collectibles \u2013 opened its first of three London shops in 2022, and will open one in Manchester next month. The company reported that its international sales increased by more than 400% last year as it opened stores across Europe.\n\nPop Mart\u2019s artist-created collectibles, including Labubu which went viral last year after featuring on the Instagram account of Lisa from K-pop band Blackpink, are part of the rise of \u201ckidult\u201d toys, with items proudly bought and owned by adult fans as well as younger consumers. Sales of kidult toys \u2013 aimed at those aged 12 and above \u2013 hit \u00a31bnlast year, up \u00a357m from 2023.\n\nLast year, even the V&A museum got in on the act, hiring advisers on Lego and Pok\u00e9mon memorabilia in recognition of the growing cultural importance of these toys.\n\nAlex Tetley is senior executive sales administrator at Mighty Jaxx, a Singaporean company that creates art toy collectibles. He is a collector as well as a businessman, having grown up on Star Wars figures and worked as a buyer at Hasbro, the company behind Transformer and Marvel toys, before joining Mighty Jaxx. He said the collector community is a friendly place and that more people now see themselves as collectors. \u201cI think everyone collects something. They just don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nChivers-Procter said there are also more opportunities for collectors to meet. \u201cThe Bandai Namco Camden store exemplifies the importance of creating spaces where fans can connect. For UK collectors, having a physical space to interact with products and other fans enhances their experience and loyalty.\n\n\u201cThis will be a key focus in 2025, with more events taking place throughout the year.\u201d\n\nTetley said he has a shelving unit filling one wall of his office to display the figurines he has collected over many years. \u201cSometimes I just like to sit back and look at them.\u201d",

            "content": "SUNRISE, Fla. \u2014 Yes, Frank Nazar is a sensational skater with a quick first step and blistering straight-line speed. Yes, he\u2019s aggressive in the offensive zone with a knack for putting the puck in the net. Yes, he\u2019s found natural chemistry with Connor Bedard on the Blackhawks\u2019 top line, something it\u2019s fun to imagine sticking for the next, oh, 10 years or so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s possible that none of those highly sought-after skills is Nazar\u2019s most critical attribute. Lots of young players are fast and can score, after all. But not a lot of young players have Nazar\u2019s unerring confidence.\n\nIt\u2019s not arrogance \u2014 he\u2019s highly coachable, he listens, he processes. It\u2019s not stubbornness \u2014 he adapts, he learns.\n\nYou\u2019re just not going to get Nazar down. You\u2019re not going to wipe that smile off his face and you\u2019re not going to get him to crawl inside his own head and start doubting himself.\n\nSo when interim head coach Anders Sorensen has a chat with Nazar following one of the roughest games of his young career \u2014 when the Carolina Hurricanes ran roughshod over him, as they do so many players young and old \u2014 Nazar took it in the spirit it was intended: constructive, helpful, necessary. A short time later, he was off the ice and in the locker room, big smile on his face as always.\n\nAnd when Nazar gets bumped from that top line in favor of fellow rookie Landon Slaggert, as he was during the Blackhawks\u2019 uninspiring 5-1 loss to the defending champion Florida Panthers on Saturday afternoon, there won\u2019t be any wallowing, any doubting.\n\n\u201cGood habit, right?\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good attribute to have as a person, right? I think he\u2019s got a real good demeanor. He understands. Even talking to him (at Friday\u2019s practice), we talked about (the Carolina) game and how it wasn\u2019t where we want it to be. OK, it\u2019s a new day, turn the page and move on, right? For a young guy that\u2019s impressive.\u201d\n\nWhy would Nazar sulk? He\u2019s in the NHL at 21 years old, and he doesn\u2019t appear to be going anywhere. When he was called up from Rockford in mid-December, he wasn\u2019t sure if it would be for a quick cup of coffee or for the rest of his career. Twenty-three games later, Nazar\u2019s been a fixture in the top six. Win or lose, play well or play poorly, exhausted by the grind or not, it sure beats one of those bus trips to Grand Rapids \u2014 four hours each way with a game in between, all in one day, all the day after a home game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one of the first things Nazar noticed about being in the NHL \u2014 the lifestyle.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a little busier, but the travel\u2019s a lot easier on our bodies here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be a little bit more travel, but in the AHL, you\u2019re busing and playing back-to-back games on weekends. But the games are a lot different.\u201d\n\nAh, yes, the games. Nazar was tearing it up in the AHL, with 11 goals and 13 assists in 21 games. He was named an AHL All-Star. And while nobody\u2019s saying it\u2019s easy to play in the AHL, it\u2019s certainly a lot harder in the NHL. There\u2019s nothing in the AHL quite like Carolina\u2019s Mikko Rantanen barreling down the wing, or Florida\u2019s Matthew Tkachuk going hard on the forecheck. Off the ice, you\u2019ve got to take better care of your body \u2014 eat right, sleep right, prepare right. But on the ice, there\u2019s no coasting, no energy conservation. It\u2019s go-go-go at all times.\n\n\u201cThe league is relentless,\u201d Sorensen said.\n\nNazar already had learned that but got a rough reminder in Raleigh and Sunrise.\n\n\u201cIn the \u2018A,\u2019 you can sit back a little bit and kind of let the play develop,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, you\u2019ve got to keep moving, you\u2019ve got to stay on your guy, you\u2019ve got to keep your feet going and stay on the puck. You don\u2019t get as much rest during your shift, which is something I had to get used to and understand the first couple of games. But I feel a lot better with that, a lot more confident with it and I\u2019ve been doing a good job of it.\u201d\n\nNazar scored a goal in his three-game stint at the end of last season, but it took 12 games for him to bury his first NHL goal of this season. At that point, he only had two assists to his name, too. His confidence wasn\u2019t wavering, but his frustration was mounting a bit.\n\nBut that quickly changed as he was elevated to Bedard\u2019s line. A four-game stretch from Jan. 18-26 in which he had two goals and three assists calmed any rising tension he might have felt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt obviously feels really good to be able to know I can put up numbers like that and put the puck in the back of the net,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to earn it, and it\u2019s all about how hard you work and how willing you are to put that work in. Consistency is the biggest thing up here. You\u2019ve got to show up each and every night, every shift. You\u2019ve got to treat your body well and take care of yourself. It\u2019s a tough league, you\u2019re traveling around every other day, almost. It\u2019s a different city every couple of nights. Being able to take care of yourself, show up and just be a pro, that\u2019s the major thing.\u201d\n\nWhether Nazar stays in Chicago for the rest of the season or not, whether he gets back to the top line or not, whether he has a four-game point streak or a two-game struggle session, Nazar believes in himself and what he can do at this level. That\u2019s a rare trait for a player who just turned 21, and one that should serve him well throughout the ups and downs of his rookie season and beyond.\n\n\u201cYou have to take those lessons,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to play great your whole life. There\u2019s going to be a game every now and then in any league that you\u2019re going to feel bad and not be at your best. The best thing to do is just learn from it, move on and keep on going. It\u2019s pretty awesome looking back and thinking I\u2019ve got 25 games under my belt. It\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019m just trying to keep learning and keep being a better pro, keep getting better.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Halfway through the first period of Saturday\u2019s game, Florida was outshooting Chicago 17-2. By the end of the first period, the Panthers had outshot the Blackhawks 22-3, out-attempted them 47-9, out-chanced them 28-5, and had a staggering 15 high-danger chances to the Blackhawks\u2019 one, per Natural Stat Trick. It didn\u2019t get a heck of a lot better from there, and if not for a 39-save by Petr Mr\u00e1zek, it could have been a lot uglier.\n\nIt was the fourth time in the last eight games the Blackhawks have given up at least 40 shots on goal. Chicago looked flat-footed and helpless against Florida\u2019s forecheck and looked alarmingly passive defensively for most of the game. Even stalwart defender Alex Vlasic has been struggling lately. He passed the puck right to Florida\u2019s Evan Rodrigues from behind the goal for the backbreaker 10 seconds into the third period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just him, though, right?\u201d Sorensen said of Vlasic. \u201cIt\u2019s a group effort. So maybe he\u2019s the one that gets exposed, but it\u2019s more of a group thing. There needs to be layers to help.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Slaggert set a new franchise record for the fastest goal scored in a game, bursting through the Panthers defense off the opening faceoff, taking a Ryan Donato pass and beating Sergei Bobrovsky five-hole just seven seconds in. The previous Blackhawks record was set by Brent Sutter in 1995 at eight seconds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider Slaggert a fan of matinees.\n\n\u201cYeah, I do enjoy them,\u201d he said. \u201cJust kind of get right to the hockey, right to the action. Not much time to lay around.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Louis Crevier left the game in the first period after being boarded by Florida\u2019s Jonah Gadjovich and didn\u2019t return. That left the Blackhawks with just five defensemen, forcing Connor Murphy \u2014 playing his first game since the Winter Classic \u2014 to play 23 minutes, 30 seconds. Murphy said he felt fine physically but obviously wasn\u2019t thrilled with the defensive effort as a team.\n\nRookies Nolan Allan and Ethan Del Mastro were both scratched, while veterans Murphy and TJ Brodie were in. Juggling the youngsters versus the veterans has been tricky for Sorensen, who said little \u201cresets\u201d are good for the rookies.\n\nSometimes, there can be some pushback from young and old alike.\n\n\u201cThe communication is a big part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere we see it, we don\u2019t always agree on everything. But this is where we see it. They\u2019ve been good, though. Everybody\u2019s been understanding, but everybody wants to play every day.\u201d\n\n(Photo of Frank Nazar and Florida\u2019s Niko Mikkola: Eliot J. Schechter / NHLI via Getty Images)",

            "content": "UPS Shares Drop Amid Weak 2025 Financial Guidance Company faces scrutiny as package volume cuts with Amazon and dividend coverage concerns emerge.\n\nUPS is currently facing significant scrutiny as shares plummeted 14% after the company revealed weaker-than-expected financial guidance for 2025.\n\nOn January 30, 2025, UPS's stock hit its lowest price since 2020, closing at $114.90, following the announcement of its financial projections and news concerning its relationship with Amazon, its largest customer.\n\nDuring the company's earnings announcement, management outlined projected earnings of $8.66 per share for the current year, translating to approximately $7.4 billion. This falls starkly against the $6.52 per share dividend being paid out, raising concerns about the sustainability of its dividend strategy.\n\nCEO Carol Tome publicly assured investors about the safety of UPS's 5.7% dividend, indicating the company expects to generate $5.7 billion of free cash flow by 2025. She stressed, \"from a dividend payout perspective, we\u2019re targeting 50% of earnings and we\u2019re higher than... It's important to note, the payout ratio isn\u2019t as high as it appears at its base. So plenty of liquidity to pay the dividend.\" This statement aimed to quell fears over the company\u2019s dividends, which have become increasingly questioned due to anticipated tight earnings coverage.\n\nAnother contributing factor to the stock decline is the significant 50% reduction announced for package volumes with Amazon, which has traditionally been one of UPS's largest revenue sources. Investors reacted negatively to this news, fearing reduced income and profitability.\n\nBrandon Oglenski, a Barclays analyst, questioned UPS's strategy during the earnings call, asking, \"How prudent is a $1 billion share repurchase this year with anticipated dividend payments of $5.5 billion?\" His concern points to the balancing act UPS must maintain between rewarding shareholders and ensuring adequate cash flow for the company's operational needs.\n\nDespite these concerns, Tome maintained confidence, highlighting UPS's financial prudence. She noted the established $1.63 per share quarterly dividend, which has shown modest growth, raising just one cent from the previous year.\n\nThe current dividend coverage appears more favorable based on net income, with UPS ensuring strong cash flow projections. The challenge lies in managing shareholder expectations amid changing business dynamics, particularly with Amazon.\n\nUPS's dividend now ranks 15th within the S&P 500, signaling strong corporate commitments to returns, but remains lower compared to higher-yielding stocks such as Altria and Pfizer.\n\nGiven this precarious situation, investors will be closely monitoring UPS's next moves. The firm's ability to navigate through shrinking relations with Amazon and sustaining its dividend policies will be pivotal to its stock performance and overall health.\n\nThe outcomes of this phase will significantly influence UPS's market perception as it attempts to maintain stability amid mounting pressures. While the firm stands by its dividend commitments, adequate generation of free cash flow and effective repurchase strategies will be key to restoring confidence among its investors.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nUPS will reduce the amount of Amazon volume it delivers by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 under an agreement in principle reached by the two companies, UPS announced Thursday.\n\nThe carrier determined if it took no action on its relationship with Amazon, it would likely result in diminishing returns, CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said on a Q4 earnings call.\n\n\"Amazon is our largest customer, but it's not our most profitable customer,\" Tom\u00e9 said. \"Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business.\"\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe agreement marks an acceleration of UPS' yearslong push to reduce its reliance on Amazon for volume and revenue. The carrier is striving to capture volume from more profitable segments like healthcare product shippers and small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\nAmazon has built out its own logistics network to deliver more customer orders itself but still uses a mix of carriers to cover the remainder of its orders. According to Amazon, it offered to increase UPS' volumes as the e-commerce giant\u2019s delivery needs continued to grow.\n\n\u201cDue to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement emailed to sister publication Supply Chain Dive. \"We\u2019ll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\u201d\n\nEven with previous volume reduction efforts, Amazon still makes up a large portion of UPS' business. Executives said about 20% to 25% of volume in UPS' U.S. network is tied to Amazon, and the percentage of revenue derived from the company last year was 11.8%.\n\nThe decline in Amazon volume will lead to fewer packages being delivered by UPS, but at more profitable rates. In 2025, UPS expects average daily U.S. volume to drop about 8.5% year over year while revenue per package is projected to increase by 6%, per an earnings presentation.\n\n\"The results of this change will be lower overall volume levels, but an improved customer base at a significantly higher revenue per piece,\" EVP and CFO Brian Dykes said, adding that UPS will adjust its network as necessary to match capacity with demand.\n\nTom\u00e9 said she doesn't believe the remainder of Amazon's volume is on the chopping block, noting Amazon's reliance on The UPS Store locations for customer returns.\n\n\"I don't think it will go all away,\" Tom\u00e9 said. \"I think we're landing at the right spot with this accelerated glide down.\"",

Now, UPS is reducing Amazon deliveries to make even more.\n\nAmazon accounts for 20% to 25% of UPS\u2019s packages in the U.S. But UPS makes less profit per Amazon package. That\u2019s one reason UPS has already been cutting the number of Amazon packages it delivers every year.\n\n\u201cAmazon is our largest customer, but it\u2019s not our most profitable customer,\u201d CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 told investor analysts.\n\nUPS is reducing the amount of Amazon volume to increase the company\u2019s profits per package and overall operating margins.\n\n\u201cBetter Not Bigger\u201d\n\nThis is all part of the company\u2019s \u201cbetter not bigger\u201d strategy which puts more emphasis on profit margins than on volume and job creation.\n\nIt\u2019s the same reason that UPS is closing rural buildings and older facilities and building modern, automated hubs. UPS told investors it wants to close 10% of its facilities.\n\nUPS Teamsters want the company to be successful to protect and create good union jobs.\n\nCEO Carol Tome wants higher profit margins. She\u2019s catering to Wall Street. Their idea of \u201cbetter\u201d is very different from ours. So what do we do?\n\nFocus on Contract Enforcement and Union Action\n\nIt\u2019s been a month of whiplash for UPS Teamsters. Earlier this month, Surepost ended and volume surged. Now UPS is announcing Amazon volume will drop over the next 18 months.\n\nAs union members, we need to focus on what we can control. That\u2019s not volume. It\u2019s contract enforcement.\n\nWhen volume and excessive overtime surges, 9.5 rights and 8-hour requests are tools we have to fight excessive overtime. When volume drops, they become tools to protect jobs by distributing the work.\n\nInside workers have other tools, including supervisors working grievances and protecting our daily guarantee.\n\nThe company has their agenda which is higher profit margins. Our agenda is enforcing our contract and protecting good union jobs.\n\nUPS Teamsters need to get behind our union\u2019s efforts to organize Amazon and stop the race to the bottom in our industry.\n\nNow more than ever, we need to be protecting ourselves by enforcing the contract and uniting as Teamsters to protect good union jobs.\n\nCheck out our most recent webinar for tips on contract enforcement and protecting ourselves from discipline:",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nA combination of service risks and price concerns led UPS to break away from the U.S. Postal Service for SurePost deliveries, UPS CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said on an earnings call Thursday.\n\nUPS was worried about \"service deterioration\" for SurePost packages delivered by the Postal Service due to changes incentivizing the drop off of packages further upstream in the agency's network, Tom\u00e9 said. She also noted the Postal Service wanted to increase rates for delivering SurePost packages.\n\n\"That value proposition of an increased cost as well as deteriorating service, that didn't work for us,\" the CEO said. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy defended the moves in a recent interview with Supply Chain Dive, saying they were necessary for the agency\u2019s future and expressing confidence in service reliability.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nUPS began making all SurePost deliveries in-house at the start of 2025 and raised rates on the service shortly after by an average of 9.9%, EVP and CFO Brian Dykes said on the call.\n\nThe combination caught many shippers off guard and has sparked increased interest in alternative delivery services. Dykes acknowledged that the delivery insourcing and rate increases could lead to customer churn.\n\n\"There are some customers that this might not work for, and we've taken that into account in our forecast,\" Dykes said.\n\nDespite the risk of losing business, UPS executives said the move will ensure SurePost packages are delivered with strong service without impacting the company's financial performance.\n\nThe carrier already increased the amount of SurePost volume it redirected back into its own network by 660 basis points from Q3 to Q4, according to Dykes. That resulted in half of all SurePost packages being delivered by UPS drivers.\n\n\"The investments that we have made in the network and the technology allowed us to insource almost 1.5 million stops within a matter of weeks,\" Dykes said.\n\nDelivery stops have increased, but the company also saw a reduction in spending on purchased transportation in Q4 as a result of insourcing more SurePost activity, according to an earnings presentation.",

In January 2024, it laid off 12,000 workers as part of an effort to claw back $1 billion in savings.\n\nAmazon told us that the company had previously offered to increase UPS' volumes, and that it has a strong working relationship with the delivery partner.\n\nUPS declined to offer any further comments beyond what was announced on its earnings call.",

However, revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the stock tumbled to a multi-year low of $109.62.\n\nThe sharp decline was due to the decision to reduce business with its largest customer Amazon AMZN. To this end, UPS\u2019 management announced that it has reached an agreement in principle with its largest customer to lower AMZN\u2019s volume with UPS by more than 50% by June 2026.\n\nThe Amazon news was mainly responsible for the shipping giant issuing a lackluster revenue guidance for 2025. For the current year, on a consolidated basis, UPS expects revenues to be $89 billion, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $94.6 billion.\n\nWhy the Decision to Cut Business With Amazon\n\nAgreed that Amazon is United Parcel Service\u2019s largest customer (the two companies have been in partnership for nearly 30 years), but it is not UPS\u2019 most profitable customer as stated by Carol Tome, UPS\u2019 chief executive officer. Tome stated that Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business.\n\nThe small package market is a slow-growth market with lower margins. The small package market, excluding Amazon, is expected to grow in the low single digits in 2025. The profitability associated with transporting smaller packages over shorter distances is diminishing by the day. The CEO noted that as multiple assets and resources were used to support the volume of Amazon packages, the volume declines logically meant that the need to support those resources also got reduced.\n\nThe Amazon move will help the company to focus on fewer but more lucrative deliveries. The move is also in line with UPS\u2019 objective to slash $1 billion in costs for buildings, trucks, planes and labor this year. The move will also help reduce concerns regarding too much volume being concentrated on a single customer.\n\nThe sharp drop in United Parcel Service\u2019s stock price on Jan. 30 naturally gives rise to the question as to whether investors should buy UPS stock now or wait for a better entry point. Before we check the investment worthiness of UPS stock, let us take a look at the company\u2019s fourth-quarter performance in brief.\n\nHighlights of Q4 Earnings\n\nUnited Parcel Service reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings (excluding 74 cents per share) of $2.75, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.52 and improved 11.3% year over year. U.S. Domestic Package revenues of $17.3 billion grew 2.2% year over year, driven by a 2.4% increase in revenue per piece and a rise in air cargo.",

Our contract with Amazon came up this year, and so we said it\u2019s time to step back for a moment and reassess our relationship.\u201d\n\nTom\u00e9 said it was UPS\u2019 decision, not Amazon\u2019s, \u201cbecause if we take no action, it will likely result in diminishing returns.\u201d\n\nUPS has also been trying to scale back its business with Amazon in recent years, though the new plan accelerates that timeline. \u201cThe speed of the glide down is five times faster than our initial glide-down efforts between 2021 and 2024,\u201d CFO Brian Dykes said.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel told the Wall Street Journal that UPS requested the reduction in volume to address its own operational needs. She said, \u201cWe certainly respect their decision. We\u2019ll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\u201d\n\nThe move comes as Amazon has been building out its own logistics network. In 2020, Amazon delivered more packages than UPS. In 2023, data showed that Amazon was shipping more packages than both UPS its main rival, FedEx. FedEx in 2019 went through the process of eliminating Amazon from its delivery network, turning its focus to shipping products for other customers.\n\nOn Thursday, shares of UPS fell 14% \u2014 its \u201csharpest one-day drop,\u201d per the WSJ \u2014 as the move resulted in the delivery giant projecting sales will decline to $89 billion in 2025 from $91.1 billion in 2024 and below the average of analysts\u2019 revenue estimate of $95 billion.\n\nUPS plans to reconfigure its U.S. network, with expected cuts to labor hours and the size of its vehicle and aircraft fleets, as well as undertake other moves designed to generate $1 billion in savings. UPS is also in-sourcing SurePost deliveries for smaller orders after recently ending its partnership that used the U.S. Postal Service for last-mile delivery following a change in the USPS\u2019 operating model that would have increased costs for UPS and potentially disrupted service.\n\n\u201cThis does fit with their strategy of better, not bigger,\u201d Stephens Inc. analyst Daniel Imbro told Bloomberg of UPS\u2019 move to shrink its Amazon volume. \u201cBut it appears to be a headwind to earnings, given the lack of underlying revenue growth.\u201d\n\nSatish Jindel, president of shipment technology firm ShipMatrix, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the move was \u201cprobably a win-win\u201d for both Amazon and UPS as \u201cboth realize they are headed to a competitive relationship, and might as well do it in a friendly and a gradual manner that is good for both of them.\u201d\n\nHe noted that \u201cFulfillment by Amazon\u201d is delivering packages of other retailers on the Amazon platform.\n\nFor its part, Amazon still relies on UPS for some of its more complex deliveries. Morningstar analyst Matthew Young said in a recent report, \u201cTaking it all in-house would probably require heavy incremental investment, especially given Amazon\u2019s own internal peak-season needs.\u201d",

The effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%.\n\n* \u201cNon-GAAP Adjusted\u201d or \u201cNon-GAAP Adj.\u201d amounts are non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. See the appendix to this release for a discussion of non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, including a reconciliation to the most closely correlated GAAP measure.\n\n\u2020 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, including the recast of air cargo volume to U.S. Domestic, with no change to consolidated results.

Statements other than those of current or historical fact, and all statements accompanied by terms such as \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cassume,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d and similar terms, are intended to be forward-looking statements.\n\nFrom time to time, we also include written or oral forward-looking statements in other publicly disclosed materials. Forward-looking statements may relate to our intent, belief, forecasts of, or current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects, future results, or future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made and the future, by its very nature, cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nForward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally; significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis; changes in our relationships with our significant customers; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees; increased or more complex physical or operational security requirements; a significant cybersecurity incident, or increased data protection regulations; our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation; impacts from global climate change; interruptions in or impacts on our business from natural or man-made events or disasters including terrorist attacks, epidemics or pandemics; exposure to changing economic, political, regulatory and social developments in international and emerging markets; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; the effects of changing prices of energy, including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, other fuels and interruptions in supplies of these commodities; changes in exchange rates or interest rates; our ability to accurately forecast our future capital investment needs; increases in our expenses or funding obligations relating to employee health, retiree health and/or pension benefits; our ability to manage insurance and claims expenses; changes in business strategy, government regulations or economic or market conditions that may result in impairments of our assets; potential additional U.S. or international tax liabilities; increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change; potential claims or litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters; and other risks discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequently filed reports. You should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements, except as required by law.\n\nThe Company routinely posts important information, including news releases, announcements, materials provided or displayed at analyst or investor conferences, and other statements about its business and results of operations, that may be deemed material to investors on the Company\u2019s Investors Relations website at www.investors.ups.com. The Company uses its website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and for complying with the Company\u2019s disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Investors should monitor the Company\u2019s Investor Relations website in addition to following the Company\u2019s press releases, filings with the SEC, public conference calls and webcasts. We do not incorporate the contents of any website into this or any other report we file with the SEC.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures\n\nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") with certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Management views and evaluates business performance on both a GAAP basis and by excluding costs and benefits associated with these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. As a result, we believe the presentation of these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures better enables users of our financial information to view and evaluate underlying business performance from the same perspective as management.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP adjusted financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nForward-Looking Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Metrics\n\nFrom time to time when presenting forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, we are unable to provide quantitative reconciliations to the most closely correlated GAAP measure due to the uncertainty in the timing, amount or nature of any adjustments, which could be material in any period.\n\nOne-Time Payment for International Regulatory Matter\n\nWe supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, interest expense, total other income (expense), income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of a second quarter of 2024 one-time payment of $94 million of previously restricted cash to settle a previously-disclosed challenge by Italian tax authorities to the deductibility of Value Added Tax payments by UPS to certain third-party service providers, a review of which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2023. We do not believe this is a component of our ongoing operations and we do not expect this or similar payments to recur.\n\nExpense for Regulatory Matter\n\nWe supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, interest expense, total other income (expense), income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of an expense to settle a regulatory matter that we consider to be unrelated to our ongoing operations and that we do not expect to recur.\n\nTransformation Strategy Costs\n\nWe supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of charges related to activities within our transformation strategy. Our transformation activities have spanned several years to fundamentally change the spans and layers of our organization structure, processes, technologies and the composition of our business portfolio. While earlier stages of these transformation activities were complete in 2023 (Transformation 1.0), certain systems implementations and portfolio review activities (Transformation 2.0) are ongoing and expected to continue through 2025. We previously announced initiatives under Fit to Serve to right-size our business through a workforce reduction of approximately 12,000 positions throughout 2024 and create a more efficient operating model to enhance responsiveness to changing market dynamics. Various circumstances have precipitated these initiatives, including identification and prioritization of investments as a result of executive leadership changes, developments and changes in competitive landscapes, inflationary pressures, consumer behaviors, and other factors including post-COVID normalization and volume diversions attributed to our 2023 labor negotiations.\n\nAs disclosed on January 30, 2025, we are beginning a network reconfiguration which is expected to lead to consolidations of our facilities and workforce as well as end-to-end process redesign from 2025 \u2013 2027. Our network reconfiguration is expected to result in exit activities that could result in the closure of up to 10% of our buildings, a reduction in the size our vehicle and aircraft fleets, and a decrease in the size of our workforce. These costs are in addition to operational costs that we may incur. We are not yet able to determine the specific assets or extent of our workforce that will be impacted by our network redesign, the timing of those future changes or the associated charges we will incur and therefore are not currently able to provide an estimate of the total cost or the cost by period. We expect that impacted assets will remain in use during some or all of the periods of our network reconfiguration.\n\nWe expect to partially offset incurred costs through end-to-end process redesign carried out during our network reconfiguration through our Efficiency Reimagined initiatives. These initiatives are being undertaken to align our organizational processes to the operational changes expected to occur in our network reconfiguration and drive organizational efficiency. These initiatives are expected to yield approximately $1.0 billion in annualized savings. We incurred related costs of $35 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024. We expect to incur related costs of approximately $300 to $400 million during 2025 primarily associated with outside professional services and severance. Upon the completion of our network reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined initiatives, we expect to realize further benefits in subsequent periods from lower expense, including depreciation, compensation, benefit and other, as well as lower capital requirements.\n\nWe do not consider the related costs to be ordinary because each program involves separate and distinct activities that may span multiple periods and are not expected to drive incremental revenue, and because the scope of the programs exceeded that of routine, ongoing efforts to enhance profitability. These initiatives are in addition to ordinary, ongoing efforts to enhance business performance.\n\nGoodwill and Asset Impairments\n\nWe supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of goodwill and asset impairment charges. We do not consider these charges when evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards.\n\nGains and Losses Related to Divestitures\n\nWe supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of gains (or losses) related to the divestiture of businesses. We do not consider these transactions when evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards.\n\nOne-Time Compensation Payment\n\nWe supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of a one-time payment made to certain U.S.-based, non-union part-time supervisors following the ratification of our labor agreement with the Teamsters in 2023. We do not expect this or similar payments to recur.\n\nMultiemployer Pension Plan Withdrawal\n\nWe supplement the presentation of operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of a charge related to the withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan within the United States. We do not consider these costs to be related to our ongoing operations nor do we expect them to recur.\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Cost per Piece\n\nWe evaluate the efficiency of our operations using various metrics, including non-GAAP adjusted cost per piece. Non-GAAP adjusted cost per piece is calculated as non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in a period divided by total volume for that period. Because non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses exclude costs or charges that we do not consider a part of underlying business performance when monitoring and evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards, we believe this is the appropriate metric on which to base reviews and evaluations of the efficiency of our operational performance.\n\nDefined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Gains and Losses\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation), as well as gains and losses resulting from plan curtailments and settlements, for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of Investment income (expense) and other in the statements of consolidated income. We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these defined benefit pension and postretirement plan gains and losses provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with plan amendments and short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values and similar factors.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in other investing activities. We believe free cash flow is an important indicator of how much cash is generated by our ongoing business operations and we use this as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted Total Debt / Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted total debt is defined as our long-term debt and finance leases, including current maturities, plus non-current pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for the impacts of transformation strategy costs, a gain on divestiture of Coyote, a one-time payment for an international regulatory matter, goodwill and asset impairment charges, a one-time compensation payment, expense related to a regulatory matter, defined benefit plan gains and losses, investment income and other pension income, and a charge to withdraw from a multiemployer benefit plan. We believe the ratio of adjusted total debt to adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of our financial strength, and is a ratio used by third parties when evaluating the level of our indebtedness.\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Return on Invested Capital\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted ROIC is calculated as the trailing twelve months (\u201cTTM\u201d) of non-GAAP adjusted operating income divided by the average of total debt, non-current pension and postretirement benefit obligations and shareowners\u2019 equity, at the current period end and the corresponding period end of the prior year. Because non-GAAP adjusted ROIC is not a measure defined by GAAP, we calculate it, in part, using non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are most indicative of our ongoing business performance. We consider non-GAAP adjusted ROIC to be a useful measure for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of our long-term capital investments.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nUPS will reduce the amount of Amazon volume it delivers by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 under an agreement in principle reached by the two companies, UPS announced Thursday.\n\nThe carrier determined if it took no action on its relationship with Amazon, it would likely result in diminishing returns, CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said on a Q4 earnings call.\n\n\"Amazon is our largest customer, but it's not our most profitable customer,\" Tom\u00e9 said. \"Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business.\"\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe agreement marks an acceleration of UPS' yearslong push to reduce its reliance on Amazon for volume and revenue. The carrier is striving to capture volume from more profitable segments like healthcare product shippers and small- and medium-sized businesses.\n\nAmazon has built out its own logistics network to deliver more customer orders itself but still uses a mix of carriers to cover the remainder of its orders. According to Amazon, it offered to increase UPS' volumes as the e-commerce giant\u2019s delivery needs continued to grow.\n\n\u201cDue to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement emailed to Supply Chain Dive. \"We\u2019ll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\u201d\n\nEven with previous volume reduction efforts, Amazon still makes up a large portion of UPS' business. Executives said about 20% to 25% of volume in UPS' U.S. network is tied to Amazon, and the percentage of revenue derived from the company last year was 11.8%.\n\nThe decline in Amazon volume will lead to fewer packages being delivered by UPS, but at more profitable rates. In 2025, UPS expects average daily U.S. volume to drop about 8.5% year over year while revenue per package is projected to increase by 6%, per an earnings presentation.\n\n\"The results of this change will be lower overall volume levels, but an improved customer base at a significantly higher revenue per piece,\" EVP and CFO Brian Dykes said, adding that UPS will adjust its network as necessary to match capacity with demand.\n\nTom\u00e9 said she doesn't believe the remainder of Amazon's volume is on the chopping block, noting Amazon's reliance on The UPS Store locations for customer returns.\n\n\"I don't think it will go all away,\" Tom\u00e9 said. \"I think we're landing at the right spot with this accelerated glide down.\"",

            "content": "UPS has reached an agreement with Amazon to slash its delivery volumes with the e-commerce giant by more than 50% by the latter half of 2026.\n\nWhile Amazon accounted for 20-25% of its UPS's U.S. package volumes, making Amazon UPS's largest customer, that business was responsible for under 12% of the delivery company's total revenue in 2024, according to UPS's fourth quarter earnings report released on January 30. CEO Carole Tom\u00e9 told investors in a conference call that Amazon is \"not our most profitable partner,\" and that UPS is \"taking control of our destiny\" moving forward. In a statement to Reuters, Amazon said that they respect the decision from UPS to scale back delivery volumes, adding that it will \"continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\" Tom\u00e9 further clarified that UPS doesn't plan to cut the remaining half of its business with Amazon after 2026, and that she believes the company is \"landing at the right spot with this accelerated glide down.\"\n\nUPS has struggled with declining shipping volumes for years, and has sought to cut costs to account for those losses. In 2024, the company permanently shuttered 11 facilities, with plans in 2025 to close up to 10% of its buildings, reduce its fleet size, and cut its labor force. UPS also set a revenue forecast of $89 billion for 2025, below the average analyst expectation of nearly $95 billion.\n\nThis also comes as Amazon has continued to reduce its reliance on external delivery services. In 2022, the company delivered more packages to U.S. homes than UPS for the first time in a single year, after eclipsing FedEx two years before that. By 2023, Amazon's logistics arm boasted the second highest market share by parcel volume in the country at 27%, trailing only the U.S. Postal Service's 31% market share.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nChanges over the past month for UPS' SurePost service will lead shippers to explore other options, but shifting volume won't be easy for every customer, parcel delivery experts told Supply Chain Dive.\n\nUPS began making all SurePost deliveries in-house on Jan. 1, rather than relying on the Postal Service for much of that activity, according to a statement on the company's investor relations website. The statement confirmed earlier remarks from the Teamsters union, which said the move brings millions of packages back into UPS' network for final-mile delivery.\n\nSurePost's delivery coverage and transit times appear to have changed as a result of the Postal Service split. UPS no longer lists PO Boxes and addresses outside the contiguous U.S. as an option for SurePost. Transit times are now an estimated two to six days in the contiguous U.S., compared to two to seven days when the Postal Service partnership was active.\n\nUPS' delivery insourcing is just one shift SurePost shippers must navigate this year \u2014 the carrier increased rates and delivery area surcharges for the service on Jan. 13. Experts said both developments have caught many shippers off guard, pushing them to assess alternatives.\n\n\"People are kind of stuck right now, but I can tell you that we're feverishly working on alternatives for our customers, because our customers certainly didn't expect it,\" said John Haber, chief strategy officer at Transportation Insight, a logistics services provider.\n\nHurdles to diversify\n\nBreaking away from SurePost is easier said than done, especially for larger shippers locked into contracts with minimum volume and spending commitments, experts said.\n\nFedEx and UPS have been offering heightened shipping discounts in contracts for more than a year as they try to gain volume in a soft demand environment. While that activity has kept delivery costs down, it could also leave shippers vulnerable to unexpected rate increases if they don't consider contract terms carefully, said Oscar Gladman, senior director of parcel solutions at Kenco Group.\n\nGladman outlined a scenario in which a customer could be locked into a deal with a multi-million dollar penalty if they don't reach their contract's minimum volume requirements. That would make it more difficult to explore other options.\n\n\"Diversification may or may not be realistic,\" Gladman said.\n\nShippers will have to consider any contract penalty expenses and if incurring those would be more expensive than absorbing SurePost's recent rate increases, according to Haber.\n\n\"In some cases, shippers are going to be handcuffed because of the way their contracts are structured, and we're seeing that,\" Haber said.\n\nSurePost alternatives abound\n\nThere is no shortage of options for shippers determined to find SurePost alternatives, said Nate Skiver, parcel analyst and LPF Spend Management founder.\n\nFedEx's Ground Economy service and the Postal Service's Ground Advantage offering are both candidates to gain business diverted from SurePost, according to Skiver. How much Ground Advantage would retain over the long term will depend on the Postal Service's on-time delivery reliability, he added.\n\nA Postal Service worker loads a delivery truck on Oct. 1, 2021 in Chicago. The agency\u2019s Ground Advantage service could be an alternative for UPS SurePost customers, experts said. Scott Olson/Getty Images via Getty Images\n\nSkiver expects customers that need to ship to military addresses or other destinations not covered by SurePost currently to use the Postal Service directly for that volume, noting it's an approach many retailers have taken before.\n\n\"If they didn't use a postal workshare service, then most often, that small volume segment of PO Box and U.S. territories was shipped directly with the Postal Service,\" Skiver said.\n\nPackage consolidators like DHL eCommerce and OSM Worldwide, who sort and hand off parcels to the Postal Service for final-mile delivery, could provide a low-cost alternative for SurePost shippers, Gladman said. SurePost is geared toward parcels weighing less than 10 pounds, and consolidators are pushing to gain more business in that weight category.\n\n\"That would be a direct threat to SurePost and Ground Economy,\" Gladman said.\n\nEven with SurePost's recent changes, the service is still a viable option for parcel shippers, according to Skiver. But how UPS handles pricing arrangements with customers after the recent rate increase remains a major question mark going forward, he added.\n\nFor UPS' part, the company said in its statement that SurePost continues to be an important part of its service portfolio.\n\n\"By leveraging the strength and flexibility of our integrated network, insourcing will allow us to control the SurePost volume from point-to-point, provide reliable service and meet our customers\u2019 needs more efficiently,\" UPS said.",

Even recent price increases haven't fully countered that behavior, with ground delivery costs projected to fall slightly year over year in Q1, according to the TD Cowen/AFS Freight Index.\n\nUPS started the widespread discounting push in 2023 to lure back shippers who, fearing a strike at the delivery giant, had diverted their packages to other carriers, said Thomas Andersen, partner and EVP of supply chain services at LJM Group.\n\n\"What we saw was maybe a 15% jump in pricing flexibility a year and a half ago,\" Andersen said. \"The pullback might only be 2, 3, 4, 5%. It's definitely not back at the level that it was before then.\"\n\nWhile pricing flexibility for shippers remains strong, Andersen and other experts don't expect 2025 prices to be as alluring as last year. For one thing, packages on both ends of the weight spectrum are experiencing pricing pressure.\n\nFor example, changes to sub-pound rates at the U.S. Postal Service are cascading into higher costs for services that have historically relied on the agency for final-mile delivery. This means the era of generous rates for lightweight e-commerce packages \"is coming to an end,\" said Steven Bergan, president of parcel carrier GLS US.\n\n\"If you're shipping sub-one pound, or even sub-three pounds, you know you're probably taking increases this year because that floor just came up too far,\" Bergan said. \"So it's going to create a different world.\"\n\nShippers with packages weighing between five and 10 pounds are more likely to find highly competitive rates this year, according to Bergan, as carriers seek more profitable deliveries in a period of low demand. Package consolidators DHL eCommerce and OSM Worldwide have expressed interest in handling packages up to 10 pounds this year, a shift from their typical lightweight focus, due to Postal Service changes.\n\n\"What we saw was maybe a 15% jump in pricing flexibility a year and a half ago.\" Thomas Andersen Partner and EVP of supply chain services, LJM Group\n\nPackages in heavier weight classes tend to have more limited delivery options \u2014 and larger fees attached to them. FedEx and UPS continue to institute sharp fee increases for bulky shipments that are difficult to move efficiently through their networks. In some cases, added fees can exceed spending on base rates for heavy package shippers, said Kenneth Moyer, partner and VP of supply chain strategies at LJM Group.\n\nLarge item surcharges have added to a growing roster of fees for shippers in recent years while increasing per-package revenues for carriers like FedEx and UPS.\n\nFedEx is being \"disciplined in getting the surcharges\" such as peak season and bulky package fees amid the competitive pricing environment, EVP and Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on a December earnings call. The company is also benefiting from surcharges for deliveries made in rural areas, even if shippers can use other carriers in those scenarios.\n\n\"The last 3% or 4% of their volume, they don't want to have to use a different provider, and so we're really being disciplined on getting those surcharges,\" Carere said. \"They are contributing, but the base rate is really pressured because of the economy.\"\n\nUPS executives could provide further insight into the parcel pricing environment on the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday. The delivery giant's approach on pricing influences how FedEx and other carriers handle rate negotiations, experts told Supply Chain Dive.\n\nIf the company's Q4 results show continued growth, Moyer foresees a tougher pricing environment for shippers in the near term. On the other hand, if UPS posts underwhelming results, Moyer expects aggressive discounting to persist.\n\nA UPS driver prepares to make deliveries on July 30, 2020, in San Francisco. UPS\u2019 upcoming earnings call could shed more light on the 2025 pricing environment, experts say. Justin Sullivan via Getty Images\n\nAmid the uncertain environment, companies should keep an eye on how their package shipping needs evolve over time \u2014 such as when selling heavier products or items that need to be delivered quickly \u2014 and negotiate terms that are most favorable for their particular portfolios, Moyer said.\n\nMark Kolde, VP of logistics engineering at logistics software provider Sifted, echoed that sentiment. He noted that with more than 150 negotiable elements in any given contract, shippers need to be \"very surgical\" in how they approach contract negotiations with carriers.\n\n\"You've got to really know your data and the impact, so you know where to hit, and then be able to know how far you can push,\" Kolde said.",

            "content": "Ever wondered what the benefits of doing Pilates roll ups every day are? You're in the right place. Admittedly a fairly niche question - even for a Pilates disciple like me - but when I was asked to test the raved-about move, I was all in.\n\nI've been practising both mat and Reformer Pilates on and off for over a decade, and I'm nothing if not a traditionalist. When it comes to finessing the OG moves, you had me at roll up. Because the truth is, while it's amazing to see Pilates studios springing up all over the place (and that's before we get started on the plethora of types there are to choose from these days, from wall Pilates, to vertical Pilates, to Tower Pilates), when it comes to harnessing the physical and mental benefits of Pilates, you can't go wrong with the original moves.\n\nIf you've started 2025 with the intention of entering your Pilates era, there's no better time to start. There's no doubt that while you can happily practice Pilates all year round (and trust me, I do), but there's something about the start of the year that makes a low-impact, mindful flow all the more appealing. And the science is compelling, too: studies (like this one, published in the journal Muscles, Ligaments and Tendons) consistently show that Pilates boosts flexibility, strength, posture and balance - all foundations of a fit and healthy body.\n\nAnd mastering the humble roll up is a great place to start. \"Roll ups are tough, but once you master them, you\u2019ll be amazed at how much stronger you feel,\" advises instructor Sam Deville. \"They\u2019re also a fantastic benchmark for progress in strength and control.\"\n\nKeep scrolling for your need to knows about the Pilates roll up and its benefits, plus find out how I got on when I tried them every day for a week. For more on Pilates generally, do check out our guides to how often you should do Pialtes, the best Pilates exercises to try from home and what happened when MC UK staffers tried Pilates toe taps every day and leg circles every day, here.\n\nPilates roll ups are arguably the most effective Pilates move of all time - so I tried them\n\nWhat is a Pilates roll up?\n\nThe second move in the 34-move series that kick started the practice as a whole, a Pilates roll up perfectly encapsulates the principles of control, stability and core strength so fundamental to the practice. Its simplicity belies its efficacy - if you're not feeling the infamous Pilates shake at some point during the move, you're probably not doing it right. But what exactly is it?\n\n\"The Pilates roll up is a classical mat based exercise, which has been designed with the aim of strengthening the core, improving spinal mobility, and stretching the hamstrings,\" explains instructor Aleksandra Warburton. \"It involves a slow, controlled movement of rolling the spine up into a C curve from a fully flat lying position to sitting tall, and then (with control) slowly rolling back down again, to the start position. This exercise is a staple in the Pilates repertoire and reflects the method\u2019s emphasis on control, precision, and flow.\"\n\nMarie Claire Newsletter Celebrity news, beauty, fashion advice, and fascinating features, delivered straight to your inbox! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMastering a slow, articulated roll up is key to accessing so many Pilates benefits, so taking your time and being precise will pay dividends.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Pilates roll ups?\n\nSpeaking of benefits, as with all the original Pilates moves, the roll up confers a wide range of mind-body boosts.\n\n1. They improve core strength\n\nThere's a reason that the core is referred to as your \"powerhouse\" in Pilates: a strong and stable core is at the centre of all the original moves, and will protect and support your spine as you move. And the roll up is the perfect move for honing your core strength, as you'll need to engage your entire mid-section as you roll both up and down in the move.\n\n\"Roll ups are an excellent way to build strength in both the superficial and deep abdominal muscles while also mobilising the spine,\" notes Deville. \"They require a coordinated effort from all the abdominal muscles: rectus abdominis (the \"six-pack\" muscles), transverse abdominis (deep core stabiliser) and obliques (internal and external waist muscles), making them one of the most effective exercises for core strengthening in the Pilates repertoire.\"\n\n2. They're great for spinal mobility and flexibility\n\nJoseph Pilates is credited with the quote \"If your spine is stiff at 30, you are old. If it is flexible at 60, you are young,\" and studies show that spinal mobility is a good indicator of quality of life in middle age (admittedly, the study was conduted on men, but it's not too much of a stretch to apply the same logic to women).\n\nAnd the roll up is an elite move for working on spinal articulation, and therefore improving mobility throughout the upper, mid and lower back. \"The rolling motion central to this move encourages articulation of the spine,\" agrees Warburton. \"Over time, this will help to improve flexibility and reduce stiffness, as you're essentially massaging your spine back onto the mat, one vertebra at a time.\"\n\nAs you progress and gain mobility, you should be aware of your ability to articulate your spine almost bone by bone - that's the aim, anyway.\n\n3. They enhance hamstring flexibility\n\nAll you runners, listen up: roll ups are a great way to stretch out tight hamstrings and even calf muscles. \"Rolling up and down stretches the hamstrings, helping to release tension in the back of the legs,\" notes Warburton.\n\nWant even more of a stretchy release? Slow the move down further.\n\n4. They enhance postural alignment and body awareness\n\nAny Pilates devotee will tell you that the practice tunes you into your body in a whole new way - not only will you be aware of muscles you didn't know you had, but, over time, you'll learn to move in a more fluid and intuitive way. Slow moves such as the roll up allow you to focus on your form and alignment, increasing your understanding of the way your body moves.\n\n\"By encouraging control and precision, roll ups help to improve posture and body awareness over time,\" agrees Warburton.\n\nHow to perform a Pilates roll up with good form\n\nAs with all and any Pilates move, when it comes to banking the maximum benefits, you'll need to ensure your form and technique is spot on.\n\n\"Roll ups are deceptively challenging and take time to master,\" cautions Deville. \"The key is to move slowly - the slower you go, the harder it is, and the more benefits you\u2019ll get from the exercise.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how to perform a roll up with good form:\n\nStart position: Sit tall on your sit bones with legs extended long in front of you, feet flexed, and your back straight. Arms should be extended forward at shoulder height. Take a deep breath in. Rolling down: As you exhale, roll off your sit bones, curving your spine into a C-shape. Engage your abs and focus on connecting your spine to the mat, vertebra by vertebra, starting at the base of your spine. Keep the movement slow and controlled, with your arms following the motion. Reaching overhead: Once you\u2019re fully lying down, stretch your arms towards the ceiling, then gently lower them overhead, ensuring your ribs stay connected to the mat. Rolling up: Inhale, and on your exhale, bring your arms back over your head. Begin to roll up slowly, leading with your head, neck, and shoulders. Engage your pelvic floor and peel your spine off the mat one vertebra at a time. Finish position: Reach forward towards your toes for a hamstring stretch, then reset by sitting tall with your arms extended in front of you.\n\nHow To Do The Pilates Roll Up Exercise - For Anyone! - YouTube Watch On\n\nI tried Pilates roll ups every day for a week - and have some thoughts\n\nDays one to three\n\nHaving refreshed my memory as to the benefits of a Pilates roll up and confident that I know the move well, I start the week with a (literal) spring in my step. If nothing else, the challenge is an excuse to leave my desk every few hours. Fortunately, my work wardrobe (a rotation of sports leggings and a hoodie) allows for me to hop onto my mat at any time and after a desk-bound morning, I can't wait to get some movement in.\n\nI've said this before - but it's amazing how researching the benefits of a move brings more awareness and intention to my movement. As I lower down into my first roll up, I'm struck by how \"sticky\" (and I'm not going to lie, a little achy, too) my lower back feels. That said, I know that I'm generally pretty in tune with my body, so maybe I'm overanalysing.\n\nEither way, once I've done the first few roll ups, I can feel myself easing into it, and the move starts to feel more fluid. Doing them cold is tough though, let me tell you - my hamstrings are screaming and my core isn't as engaged as I know it needs to be, so I feel like I'm forcing my head forward to bring my body back up to a seated position. But it turns out, I'm not alone in this.\n\n\"It's so easy to \"cheat\" with this exercise,\" coach Stacy Weeks reassures me. \"Persistence and patience are needed to do this well, don't use momentum, because when you are able to do it well it's brilliant. The trick is to break it down and start at the top, rolling back only as far as you can keep your form and not fall backwards.\"\n\nTips ringing in my ears, on days two and three I go right back to basics and slow the movement down as much as I can. I even start my practice off with some pelvic tilts to make sure I'm nicely warm and moving well and it definitely helps. I can feel my sacrum tilting under more easily, allowing my lower back to stay in contact with the mat for longer, which I take as a win.\n\nI can happily manage the recommended ten reps by day three. I'm getting into the swing of it.\n\nAnna during her Pilates roll ups challenge (Image credit: Anna Barrter)\n\nDays four to seven\n\nBy the second half of the week, I'm keen to progress the move. I turn to one of my experts for some advice on whether I can and should up the ante.\n\n\"In Pilates, we love to make exercises as challenging as they can be by making people properly connect to their muscles,\" says physiotherapist, Pilates instructor and founder of Core LDN, Claire Mills. \"To really feel the roll up, think of pushing your heels away from you and drawing your ribs back in the opposite direction. This opposition will really connect you to your abs.\"\n\nAs always in Pilates, these small tweaks are all that's needed to take the move from just about manageable to I-can't-wait-to-stop levels of hard. The shake is real - and, being totally honest, I'm getting a bit stuck at the midpoint at times.\n\nI'm conscious not to compromise my form by yanking myself up (yanking and Pilates really don't mix), so Deville suggests trying to engage with my (frankly sub-standard) pelvic floor as I roll up, to make the move smoother and more manageable. This also appeals to my multi-tasking tendencies, as I'm essentially getting a pelvic floor workout in, too.\n\nBy the end of the week, I feel like I'm a pro, easing up and down with (more!) fluidity and control. Do I feel that it's strengthened my core? In all honesty, while I've felt the move in my abs, I can't say I've noticed any strength gains in the week - but that's not especially surprising, as I'll wager it would take a few weeks of consistent practice to clock any significant benefits.\n\nWhat I have noticed, though, is more mobility through my back as a whole - in my weekly reformer class, I'm able to rotate my torso further and more easily than before, which is a win, and means my spine is moving better.\n\nFull disclosure: when I first started practising Pilates, I thought that spinal mobility was something of a myth. I was so incredibly tight it was almost as if my vertebrae were fused together, and I'm amazed at how much I've progressed since then - and while the practice never really gets any easier (sorry about that) it's so rewarding to know that my body is responding and adapting to the practice.\n\nIn the words of Joseph Pilates himself, \"in ten sessions you will feel the difference, in 20 you will see the difference, and in 30 you\u2019ll have a whole new body,\u201d and I have to concur. While the aesthetics haven't changed (and nor was this ever my aim), my mechanics sure have.\n\nAnna on her workout mat during her roll up challenge (Image credit: Anna Barrter)\n\nShop MC UK's go-to Pilates kit now:\n\nAdanola Ultimate Tank Bra \u00a329.99 at Adanola You can't go far wrong with Adanola when it comes to fit-for-purpose, bang on trend workout 'fits.

The beauty of the roll up is that it's suitable for all levels of ability, from beginner to advanced. With a few tweaks, you can modify the roll up to make it easier, or more intense. \"If you're a beginner, try modifying the move with props to make it more accessible,\" advises Mills. \"One way to do this is to wrap a band around your feet and hold onto either end of the band - the band acts as an extra abdominal muscle! Another prop you can use is ankle weights to give you a bit more support in anchoring your lower body to the mat. I also like to teach modified versions of the roll up without props - for example, I will get clients to practice both halves of the roll up separately (the forward flexion and then rolling down) until they are able to smoothly lift their body with no momentum.\"",

            "content": "When ServiceTitan announced its plan to go public in November, it was, to some, a long time coming.\n\nThe tech company, which was 17 years old at that point, had amassed more than $1 billion in capital and millions in revenue \u2013 $614 million in 2024, to be exact. It also had a previously failed initial public offering push under its belt.\n\nBut, as chief executive Ara Mahdessian said during the company\u2019s first ever earnings report this month, the IPO was \u201cnever the destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in fact, it\u2019s just the beginning of a new era for ServiceTitan, for our customers and for the trades because the only thing more exciting to me than how far we\u2019ve come is just how much further we have yet to go,\u201d Mahdessian said.\n\nServiceTitan announced its third quarter fiscal 2025 earnings in January, amid roaring fires that encroached upon the company\u2019s headquarter city, Glendale.\n\nWhen ServiceTitan announced its bid to go public in November, it was perhaps a sign that the rather slow IPO market in 2024 wouldn\u2019t stretch to 2025. Today, as company owners pick up the physical pieces of their homes and businesses, the state of the Los Angeles IPO market remains cloudy.\n\n\u201cIt has frankly become a very significant financial city, and a lot of these finance professionals have had professional losses, personal losses, their communities have had losses,\u201d said Jennifer Post, managing partner of the Century City outpost of law firm Thompson Coburn. \u201cThere\u2019s just a question of the psychological bandwidth regarding IPO leadership, if you will, to move forward with the same commitment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a moment of bittersweet irony for a company like ServiceTitan, which caters to those who build the kind of homes and businesses many in Los Angeles have lost. It\u2019s founders Mahdessian and Vahe Kuzoyan \u2013 ServiceTitan\u2019s president \u2013 grew up with parents who were in the trades; ServiceTitan was born out of a summer project meant to update Kuzoyan\u2019s father\u2019s plumbing business software, after which Kuzoyan planned on leaving Los Angeles for a Silicon Valley tech career. Instead, the pair built ServiceTitan into Glendale\u2019s only unicorn-valued company.\n\n\u201cWe are obsessed with this industry because we grew up in it. It\u2019s in our DNA,\u201d Mahdessian said during the earnings call. \u201cWe grew up watching our dads put hours and hours into building their trades businesses and struggled to see the financial success we thought they deserved.\u201d\n\nThe specs\n\nShares of the nascent public company ServiceTitan fell slightly on Jan. 14, the day after the company released its third-quarter earnings. Those stocks closed at $96.23, a 4% decline from the day prior.\n\nNonetheless, the company reported solid outcomes that beat analyst expectations. Total revenue jumped to $199 million, a 24% increase year over year. Revenue from the platform itself increased 26% year over year to $191 million.\n\n\u201cThe breadth of our platform gives us a significant advantage for two reasons: First, we have visibility into our customers\u2019 entire workflow. We know their largest challenges and can then work to deliver solutions with high ROI over time,\u201d Kuzoyan said during the earnings call. \u201cAnd because our pro products are a more sophisticated version of what is already offered in our core, the cross-sell motion is far more natural for us and for our customers because we help them get stronger in an area we\u2019re already solving for today. The benefits of these advantages extend into new trades.\u201d\n\nThe company reported $46.5 million in net loss for the third quarter of the 2025 fiscal calendar year, a 17% percent increase from the same time a year prior when the company reported $39.7 million in net loss.\n\nLooking ahead at the fourth quarter of the fiscal 2025 calendar year, the company expects to see anywhere from $199 million to $201 million in total revenue. For the full fiscal year of 2025, ServiceTitan expects to see a range between $761.6 million to $763.6 million in total revenue.\n\nThe future of IPOs\n\nAnalysts largely reported a positive outlook for ServiceTitan. Terry Tillman, managing director at Truist Securities, said in a report that ServiceTitan\u2019s earnings \u201creflected a continuation of steady execution against the company\u2019s large and durable market opportunity, in our opinion.\u201d\n\nServiceTitan is currently building out a handful of \u201cpro\u201d products, a suite of artificial intelligence-driven offerings driven by ServiceTitan\u2019s massive database of user data. Because ServiceTitan offers a slew of products in order to be a one stop shop solution for trades workers, the company has a trove of behavioral data that it leverages to create its own in-house products. The company\u2019s fleet of AI-enabled offerings include scheduling, pricing, marketing and sales, which \u201cprovide(s) significant cross-sell opportunities, deepens customer engagement, delivers on higher ROI for customers and increases the company\u2019s effective take rate, in our opinion,\u201d Tillman wrote.\n\nServiceTitan\u2019s earnings are unlikely to be the catalyst of any new IPOs, according to Post \u2013 the market under President Donald Trump is already projected to be more suitable for business dealings at large, including launching private companies out into the public market.\n\n\u201cThe unknown is what will be the full effect of the tariffs if they go into full effect, heavy-duty ICE enforcement, other things that can cause disruptions to the U.S. economy,\u201d said Post. \u201cAnd if those things happen then the interest rates are going to be frozen at best and there will just be disruptions to companies that would otherwise be looking at an IPO.\u201d\n\nBut ServiceTitan said it was not worried about changes in performance under a new administration.\n\n\u201cPeople simply do not go without air conditioning in the scorching heat or heat in the freezing cold or without plumbing,\u201d Mahdessian said during the call. \u201cEven in difficult times, the trades keep our society running.\u201d",

            "content": "There is a small but growing view in Canadian technology policy circles that Canada should reduce the number of foreign tech firms and rely almost exclusively on domestic firms, especially start-ups. This would be a critical mistake, partly because, as is true in so many nations, multinationals provide important knowledge transfers and training.\n\nIt turns out that the founders of many of Canada\u2019s most successful tech firms gained critical experience working for foreign multinational tech companies. These firms, from U.S. giants like Google and Microsoft to other global players, are significant training grounds for Canadian entrepreneurial talent.\n\nA LinkedIn review of 300 randomly selected tech start-up founders in Canada found that 41 percent had previously worked for foreign multinational tech companies in Canada. Ninety-five had worked for U.S. tech companies, while 30 had similar experiences with non-U.S. foreign tech companies. More than a quarter of the remaining 175 founders had experience working for multinational consulting firms or had the majority of their prior work experience outside of Canada. The experience of working for these multinational tech companies provides a foundation for launching successful Canadian tech start-ups. Indeed, the founders of many of Canada\u2019s most well-known tech scaleups, like 1Password, Wattpad, and Ritual, drew on their experiences working in Canada for foreign tech companies.\n\nWhile working for a foreign tech firm is certainly not the only pathway to success, the resources, learning, and exposure offered by these firms often provide individuals with critical skills for kickstarting their own ventures. For instance, their prior experience at global tech firms likely provides these founders with the opportunity to pick up best practices in software development, project management, and operations that are all directly transferable to their new entrepreneurial journey. On top of that, as foreign tech firms tend to have highly competitive salaries and benefits packages, founders can better reduce their personal financial risk when taking the leap. Finally, exposure to global technology trends and awareness of unfulfilled niches helps founders develop companies and products that are better able to solve problems existing in wider markets rather than exclusively domestic markets.\n\nSome may argue that these founders have foreign tech experience not because it drives their entrepreneurial success, but because many tech jobs in Canada are with foreign multinationals\u2014suggesting that without these global firms in Canada, these individuals would simply take on other tech roles within the country. However, Canada has relatively few domestic tech firms that compete at the same global scale as the foreign multinational tech companies for which these founders worked. In their hypothetical absence, it is not guaranteed that these founders would have had similar access to resources, advanced technologies, or international exposure. While the dominance of foreign firms may explain the employment pipeline, they are instrumental in equipping founders with skills and insights that smaller or less global domestic companies might struggle to provide.\n\nIf Canada were to follow through on the destructive advice of domestic techno-economic nationalists by discriminating against foreign tech companies and reducing the role that these companies play in the Canadian economy, many of these jobs could dry up. Foreign multinational companies may be convenient scapegoats for why Canadian tech companies have seen little large-scale success on the global stage, but their presence is not a negative. These firms are complementary and additive to the domestic tech economy. With companies like Google, Ericsson, and Microsoft all having invested hundreds of millions into Canada\u2019s economy in just the last few years and employing tens of thousands of Canadians, it is an immense mistake to discount the role that foreign tech companies play: employment, knowledge spillovers, and technology advancement.\n\nCanada\u2019s tech ecosystem benefits from the presence of foreign multinational companies, not only through job creation and investment but also by serving as a training ground for future entrepreneurs. Their role in equipping Canadian founders with global skills, networks, and perspectives is critical. Instead of viewing foreign tech companies as competitors to domestic innovation, Canada must embrace their complementary role in fostering a vibrant, interconnected tech ecosystem. Ultimately, the key lies in striking a balance\u2014leveraging the resources and opportunities these companies bring while supporting and building up Canadian companies that can compete on a global stage.",

Gas output rose 488% over the same period.\n\nThe bulk of Double Eagle\u2019s production comes out of Reagan and Martin counties, Texas. But the company also has assets in Midland, Upton, Howard, Ector, Glasscock, Andrews and Dawson counties, data show.\n\nDouble Eagle executives declined to comment on its growing Permian portfolio.\n\nDouble Eagle IV has grown operated Permian Basin production from around 43,500 boe/d in November 2023 to around 121,000 boe/d in November 2024, according to the most recent Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) data. (Source: RRC data)\n\nIn a shale play with fewer and fewer private M&A options, Double Eagle stands out as one of the most coveted opportunities, experts say.\n\nAnalysts at TD Cowen have speculated whether Ovintiv might take a shot at acquiring Double Eagle to add more Permian exposure. Those rumors never materialized, as Ovintiv made a deal for more Canadian Montney assets.\n\nMore recently, they pondered whether Civitas Resources could offload its legacy Colorado assets and acquire Double Eagle to grow in the Permian. TD Cowen analyst Gabe Daoud Jr. noted a strategic overlapping of Civitas\u2019 and Double Eagle\u2019s Permian acreage positions.\n\nBut acquiring Double Eagle would not come without risks, including a heavy price tag, a high decline rate from producing assets and only around 424 additional undrilled locations, Daoud reported in mid-January.\n\nOther sizable private equity-backed producers still left in the Permian Basin include Birch Operations, Blackbeard Operating, Sequitur Energy, Spur Energy Partners, Discovery Natural Resources and Steward Energy II, according to data compiled by Enverus Intelligence Research.\n\nDouble Eagle IV is one of the largest private equity-backed producers still standing in the Permian Basin after a whirlwind of public-private M&A. (Source: Enverus Intelligence Research)\n\nWith most of the core Permian Basin already locked up, several of these top remaining private producers are located on the fringes of the basin or in the Permian\u2019s less popular conventional zones.\n\nBlackbeard\u2019s assets are in the Central Basin Platform, while Spur and Steward have large footprints in the Northwest Shelf.\n\nSequitur Energy and Discovery Natural Resources are both heaviest in the fringier southern Midland Basin.\n\nRELATED\n\nReport: Will Civitas Sell D-J Basin, Buy Permian\u2019s Double Eagle?\n\nCommon targets, newer upside\n\nDouble Eagle co-executives Campbell and Sellers have never been ones to shy away from paying a premium for quality rock.\n\nThe two have completed thousands of individual transactions across more than 1 million acres for billions of dollars in aggregate deal volume.\n\nCampbell and Sellers guided the previous iteration of Double Eagle\u2014Double Eagle III, a subsidiary of DoublePoint Energy LLC\u2014through a $6.4 billion sale to Pioneer Natural Resources in 2021.\n\nAfter reloading with $2 billion in dry powder in 2022, Double Eagle IV got to work buying acreage in the core Permian Basin once again.\n\nSo far, the company has targeted drilling in the Midland Basin\u2019s most common and accessible zones, the prolific Spraberry and Wolfcamp benches.\n\nDE IV Operating has submitted IP data to regulators from 220 well completions in the Spraberry (Trend Area) Field, per RRC data. Most of the wells have landed in Reagan and Martin counties.\n\nPermian Basin acreage and wells operated by Double Eagle IV (DE IV Operating), according to available Rextag files. NOTE: Horizontal wells/laterals are displayed in blue; A well without a lateral indicates a legacy vertical well. (Source: Rextag data)\n\nVirtually all of Double Eagle IV\u2019s oil production over the past year came from Spraberry and Wolfcamp wells.\n\nBut Double Eagle is also on a growing list of operators interested in the Permian\u2019s deeper, gassier Barnett Shale interval.\n\nRRC records show DE IV Operating picked up two Barnett horizontals (~10,000-ft laterals) that were previously operated by Slant Energy. Slant brought the two Barnett wells online in Andrews County in early 2023.\n\nDouble Eagle\u2019s Barnett Shale wells\u2014Midland Farms 3940 #1H and #2H\u2014have produced around 1.2 Bcf of gas and 472,000 bbl of condensate since coming online in February 2023.\n\nLast year, state regulators also approved Double Eagle\u2019s plans to drill two more Barnett Shale wells in Andrews County; both wells are permitted to reach a total depth of 10,920 ft.\n\nSeveral operators, including Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Diamondback Energy and Continental Resources, have landed laterals in the Permian Barnett in recent years.\n\nRELATED\n\nPermian Prowl: Exploratory Drilling, Permitting Up for Permian Barnett Wells\n\nRed Raider power\n\nAs Campbell and Sellers embark on selling another multibillion-dollar E&P, it\u2019s a far cry from their humbler West Texas beginnings.\n\nBoth natives of Canyon, Texas, roughly 17 miles southwest of Amarillo, the two ended up playing football together at Texas Tech University under legendary coach Mike Leach; Campbell went on to play for two NFL seasons as an offensive lineman for the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nCampbell was still playing football at Texas Tech when Sellers and a third business partner formed a real estate development company, raising money through friends and family. Sellers and the third partner bought out Campbell when he went to play professionally in the NFL.\n\nBut around 2008, with the real estate investment market collapsing and energy prices skyrocketing, Sellers and Campbell decided to pursue oil and gas.\n\nSince launching Double Eagle in 2008, most of the team\u2019s efforts have been spent in the Permian Basin.\n\nThe company has also dipped into the Eagle Ford Shale, the Midcontinent and the Rockies over the years. In 2014, Double Eagle made a $225 million sale of SCOOP assets in the Anadarko Basin to Chesapeake founder Aubrey McClendon.\n\nRELATED\n\nIs Double Eagle IV the Most Coveted PE-backed Permian E&P Left?",

Zoe has been developed with a number of AI programmes and is part of the team working at the Studios\n\nMore government help is needed to fund start-up companies in the computer games industry, the head of a leading gaming firm has told BBC Politics East. Asa Burrows, chief executive of SKC Games Studio in Suffolk, said there was \"a lack of appetite to invest in the games industry\" with private investments or government grants. He said it was \"impossible\" to get the money in advance of a finished product, resorting instead to raising \u00a31.5m through friends and family. Sir Peter Bazalgette, co-chair of the Creative Industries Council, welcomed the government's investment of \u00a340m set aside for start-up video games studios, film makers and creative industries outside of London.\n\nSir Peter, who also brought Big Brother to a global audience, added: \"We need the private and public sector to invest hundreds of millions of pounds into our brilliant creative industries.\"\n\nVikki Irwin/BBC Asa Burrows, chief executive of SKC Games Studios, said the firm had to raise their investment funds through friends and family\n\nIn 2023, the gaming industry in the UK was valued at \u00a37.82bn and according to trade body uKie, employed 1,200 people in the East of England. The majority of those are in Cambridge. Babita Devi, commercial director at SKC Games Studio, said finding funding for the product was very difficult. \"It was very challenging trying to get the investment in the games studio,\" she said. The firm, which is based in Haverhill and can take advantage of the centre of learning that is Cambridge University, has recently developed a new product using sophisticated human-like gaming characters. They are designed in art studios and paired with artificial intelligence programming to create realistic avatars who can answer \"any questions\".\n\nVikki Irwin/BBC Mark Backler's Sketch Book Games created the Lost Words and he says they had a lot of \"hoops to jump through\" to get funding and some of it was just down to \"luck\".\n\nBafta-winning gamer and founder of Sketchbook Games, Mark Backler, from Ipswich, Suffolk, said finding funding was difficult in the games industry. \"There are a lot of hoops to jump through and so many are applying for funding,\" he said. Mr Backler, who also helped set up GameAnglia - which supports young people getting into the games industry in the region - said: \"One of the great things about the gaming industry is it combines creativity with business - there's a range of opportunities: doing music, animation, game design, programming, accountancy and marketing.\"\n\nSketchbook Games Lost Words: Beyond the Page was created by Sketchbook Games and aims to help young people dealing with grief\n\nSir Peter, who created popular shows such as Ready Steady Cook, Changing Rooms and Ground Force, told BBC Politics East: \"When I go into sixth forms, I ask: 'What's your favourite fashion? Movie? Game?' \"Then I say: 'What are the jobs in this industry?' and they haven't a clue. That's where we need to look in the mirror and say: 'We have not defined career path properly into the creative industries'.\"\n\nVikki Irwin/BBC Freddie and Samara have been gaming since their childhoods and are now studying for a Level 3 in Games Art and Animation\n\nThe growth of the industry is particularly important to Samara and Freddie, who are both Level 3 students at Suffolk New College in Ipswich. They are studying games art and animation. Samara, 19, from Colchester, said: \"You're learning so much and it is not just about creating games, it is the art that we are also doing, so art comes into it and we can use different mediums, like any other artists.\" Freddie, 17, from Sudbury, said he hoped there would be jobs out there when the course ended. \"You learn so many different things you can put anything into a game,\" Freddie said. \"So you are testing it all and when you go into the industry you can hone your craft.\"\n\nA Department of Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \"The creative industries, including video games, play an essential role in driving economic growth and spreading opportunity. \"We want to support talented new game developers to reach their full potential and create the next generation of hit games. \"That is why we are investing a further \u00a35.5m into the UK Games Fund over the next year to support early-stage developers, and are backing the sector through our upcoming Creative Industries Sector Plan.\"",

That\u2019s not to say that big things didn\u2019t happen, or there weren\u2019t some classic matches, but the priorities were elsewhere.\n\nThe latest iteration of SNME seems to be channeling a bit of that original energy, delivering a program that could best be described as a no-filler, no-frills, and high-energy show. Saturday\u2019s episode jumped right into the action with a Women\u2019s World Championship match that started with a bang before ring introductions had finished. Matches for the most part did not overstay their welcome and focused on big moves and action sequences rather than nuanced mat wrestling.\n\nEven the contract signing between Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens kept the energy levels high, while adding a familiar face to any lapsed fans in Shawn Michaels.\n\nBut does this formula work in 2025?

            "content": "At a webinar hosted by The Hindu in collaboration with Naruvi Hospitals, Vellore, under the Healthy India Happy India initiative on Sunday (January 26, 2025), medical experts focused on thyroid disorders, their prevention, and the importance of early detection.\n\nAravindan Nair, consultant general and endocrine surgeon at Naruvi, gave a bird\u2019s eye view on thyroid disorders emphasising on its prevalence and the need for regular check-ups.\n\n\u201cThyroid gland produces thyroxine, which is extremely important for normal functioning of the body. When it gets low, it is hypothyroid, and if it is high, it is hyperthyroid,\u201d he explained and added that swelling of thyroid was a very common occurrence.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a population survey, 40% to 50% of the population will have undiagnosed thyroid problem and only a small percentage will get detected,\u201d said Dr. Nair, who also spoke on malignant thyroid conditions.\n\nHe said cancers of thyroid are completely curable in 90% cases with treatment and not every thyroid swelling is malignant. \u201cImaging and clinical examination are essential for early intervention and to avail minimum morbidity and zero mortality treatment,\u201d Dr. Nair said.\n\nHis colleague, Sai Krishna Chaitanya P, consultant endocrinologist, detailed thyroid function tests, hypo and hyperthyroid conditions, and thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland). Identifying the condition is very important, he noted.\n\nSpecific tests\n\n\u201cMost individuals can be diagnosed as a part of health packages. But specific tests are recommended when there is a gradual weight gain or weight loss, an increase in lethargy and sleepiness, having no interest in work, feeling tired and sleepy, having constipation or diarrhoea, menstrual irregularities, persistent palpitations and sweating, chronic cough, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, delayed growth in children are symptoms where hypo- or hyperthyroidism are suspect and individuals need to get examined for thyroid function test,\u201d Dr. Chaitanya pointed out.\n\nDiscussing thyroid disorders in pregnancy, Pooja Ramakant, Professor of Endocrine Surgery at King George\u2019s Medical University, Lucknow, stressed on early detection and management because lot of changes that happen in the body of a pregnant woman mimic thyroid disorders, which is the second most common disorder after diabetes in pregnancy. \u201cThese physiological changes can continue for at least a year after pregnancy and delivery; gynaecologists can have endocrine evaluation because we need to detect them early to be able to treat them,\u201d emphasised Dr. Pooja.\n\nPreventive measures\n\nTalking of preventive measures, she advised avoiding cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower and processed food that can cause goitre. \u201cWomen before and after delivery have to maintain healthy body weight, do mind exercise, reduce stress, ensure intake of appropriate quantities of iodised salt and minerals including selenium, zinc,\u201d she advised.\n\nConsultant-general and endocrine and laparoscopic surgeon from Naruvi Hospital, Vellore, Tushar Yashwant Sonavane, covered benign thyroid tumours, highlighting the evaluation and management strategies. He showed slides of how the swellings look like, which could be worrisome and require surgery.\n\nThe doctors spoke about stress, anxiety and depression as endocrine disruptors and contributing to thyroid disorders. They mentioned that thyroid swellings could be asymptomatic but should not be ignored, if they grow in size or numbers.\n\nAdolescents, pregnant women, men above 40 and women above 50 years are at a higher risk of developing thyroid disorders and need to watch out for the changes in their bodies, they added.",

            "content": "Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes\n\nMEMPHIS \u2014 Two things stood out to Will Hardy on Saturday in Memphis.\n\nThe first: The Jazz were pretty handsy on defense, holding on shifts and reaching in on isolations, leading to 34 Memphis free throws.\n\nThe second: Utah shot 12-of-47 from 3-point range with Lauri Markkanen, Collin Sexton and Keyonte George combining to go 2-of-24.\n\nThat's a pretty bad combo \u2014 and it turned into a pretty bad result. The Grizzlies routed the Jazz 125-103 at the FedEx Forum.\n\n(Or a good one, if you are a tanking fan. The Jazz have the second-worst record in the NBA and have two wins less than the third-worse team. But back to the game ... )\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. had 28 points to lead the Grizzlies, and Zach Edey finished with 19 points and seven rebounds. Edey could also add a forced ejection to his stat line, too.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, tensions were rising between the two teams. A minor scuffle broke out when George didn't let go of the ball following a turnover, leading to some pushing and shoving between the squads. George and Ja Morant were given technicals for their role in the antics and everyone moved one.\n\nOr not ...\n\nLess than a minute later, Drew Eubanks \u2014 who was also in the middle of that dustup \u2014 accelerated toward the paint and put a shoulder into Edey. After review, the officials deemed the shoulder a non-basketball play and called a Flagrant 2 foul, ejecting Eubanks from the game.\n\nEdey scored 14 of his 19 points after the incident.\n\nBut for Utah, the minor altercations were the least of its worries.\n\n\"When you don't make shots, and a team like that is constantly playing after a miss, it's hard to get your defense set,\" Hardy said. \"It's hard to shrink those gaps appropriately because they're coming at you with a lot of force.\"\n\nThe Grizzlies play like they are shot of a cannon every possession. They are the fastest-paced team in the NBA, and rarely walk the ball up the court, regardless of the situation. But give them the ball in an obvious transition opportunity and they become near-impossible to stop.\n\nUtah found that out and then some. A poor shooting night cost them on both ends of the floor.\n\n\"Those things can compound,\" Hardy said. \"But overall, I thought the team's competitiveness and fight on the whole was good from start to finish. There are plenty of individual plays to point out where I think we could have done a better job, but it was a tough night for us shooting the ball from the perimeter.\"\n\nMarkkanen was 1-for-8 and missed his first seven attempts (the last one came in the final minute when the game was well-decided). Sexton was also 1-for-8 and George missed all eight of his 3-point attempts.\n\nAs for George, he came off the bench for the first time this season, with Hardy choosing to start rookie Isaiah Collier next to Collin Sexton in the backcourt. George and Collier both ended up playing a team-high 33 minutes, but it may be a move that signals a change for the Jazz.\n\nCollier is the better set-up man and that might fit better with the likes of Markkanen, Walker Kessler, etc. George is a more natural scorer and might be better suited as a sixth man in the long term. Was this Hardy trying a different dynamic out or a more permanent change? Time will tell.\n\nEven with the poor shooting, Hardy thought the offense was mostly fine. It's just that with the 3-point shot being such a big part of the modern NBA \u2014 and especially for the Jazz \u2014 nights like Saturday's will happen.\n\n\"When a guy like Lauri is 0-for-5, you tell him to shoot the sixth, seventh and eighth one \u2014 that's just the way we're gonna play, and that's how I believe in our team operating,\" Hardy said. \"Same thing with Collin, same thing with Keyonte.\n\n\"It's tough because there isn't necessarily a pivot because you have to read what the game gives you. And I thought the team did a decent job of generating those catch-and-shoots from three. It was just a tough night shooting the ball.\"",

That's what happened during Friday's show, but the verbal spat was set dressing to make KO look like even more of a dirtbag. Joe Tessitore perhaps said it best when he opined that Owens could start an argument in an empty room right now - he's in borderline Sami Zayn conspiracy mode these days.\n\nIt's all good stuff, but the same can't be said for this week's blue brand offering from top to bottom. There will be teething problems as WWE figures out how to produce regular three hour bangers on SmackDown, being fair. This crept into skippable territory at points, especially when the company blatantly stalled to fill time by booking several segments that achieved practically nothing.\n\nFans want to see forward momentum during this portion of the year. It's Rumble season, soon to be WrestleMania season, and that means anything feeling less-than will quickly fall by the wayside. At times, it was like the creative team suddenly realised they hadn't paid attention to the women's Rumble match at all and had to scramble. They've just launched yet another mini-push that'll play before diminishing returns too.\n\nSeveral matches upped the ante, at least. Damian Priest's arrival on Fridays breathes fresh life into things, the main event was a good watch, and it was heartening to see Tama Tonga get some valuable minutes to show what he's capable of away from tags. Those three bouts are probs the only ones you need to pay attention to from the show.\n\nHere's all the good and bad pre-Saturday Night's Main event!",

Tech giants\u2019 capital expenditures have exploded since the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s AI chatbot, in 2022, and heated competition will push spending higher. The combined yearly capital expenditures of Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft will soar past $300 billion in 2025, up from $154 billion in 2023, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley Research.\n\nMost of the money is for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips, the graphics processing units (GPUs) for huge cloud data centers owned by those tech giants and others. Other spending is for memory chips, networking gear and related data center tech, boosting Dell, Cisco, Oracle, Arista Networks, SK Hynix, Micron, Marvell and others.\n\nThe frenzied spending has sparked fears of an AI bubble, \u00e0 la the late-1990s dot-com debacle. Today\u2019s pricey AI requires lofty returns on investment to pay off. Though a correction or more painful period may occur, tech giants have massive cash piles and user bases to weather ups and downs in a decade-long AI journey. They are betting on a shift to the next big tech platform, as important, if not more, than the transition from PCs to mobile phones, which makes moving fast imperative.\n\nGreen shoots are already emerging. Microsoft-backed OpenAI has more than 300 million weekly users for its chatbot. Meta has 600 million AI users on its apps and other tools and says AI is improving ads and content suggestions. Big Tech companies are seeing fast-growing cloud sales for AI computing and tools. Consulting firm Accenture has already booked $3 billion in AI sales. AI start-ups are scoring users quickly. But the real promise is long-term. For example, OpenAI expects to lose billions yearly until it finally projects a profit in 2029 on an astounding $100 billion in yearly sales, according to a report by the New York Times.\n\nHarnessing novel tech\n\nGenerative AI stems from huge amounts of data and computing power, using the brute force of GPUs on a mountain of internet and other data. The AI systems are known as large language models that learn patterns in language to predict the next word, enabling remarkably complex and humanlike responses. The inner workings of these digital neural networks are not fully understood. Flaws, such as errors and unreliability, are still common. But expect steady improvements.\n\nAmong the companies building leading AI models: OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, Mistral AI, Cohere, Amazon, xAI and Stability AI. It costs hundreds of millions of dollars to get AI models to work, a process known as training, and takes months of constant data center computation on hundreds of billions of words or other data. That cost will go into the billions with an ever-growing demand for computing power.\n\nAI software is backed by physical infrastructure. Start with Nvidia\u2019s dominance, with millions of its high-end GPUs, costing $30,000-$40,000 each, in data centers. Nvidia\u2019s lead is poised to last for years, as its proprietary hardware and software are best in class. The company\u2019s revenue is forecast to hit nearly $200 billion per year in its 2026 fiscal year, up from $27 billion in fiscal 2023, according to Morningstar.\n\nCompetitors are trying to find Nvidia alternatives. Amazon, Meta and Google are building their own silicon. AMD and Intel have AI chips. \u201cIn the long run, we expect tech titans to strive to find second-sources or in-house solutions to diversify away from Nvidia in AI, but most likely, these efforts will chip away at, but not supplant, Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance,\u201d writes Brian Colello, Morningstar strategist, in a recent report on the company. Nvidia won\u2019t stop improving as it seeks new customers in anticipation of cooling sales.\n\nU.S. data center growth is booming, reaching a pace of $30 billion in private spending this year, up from $12 billion in 2022, according to Census data. Northern Virginia is by far the largest market, but rapid growth is spread across the U.S. in states such as Iowa, Idaho, North Dakota and Texas. Examples of the trend include Meta investing $10 billion in a new 4 million sq.-ft. facility in Louisiana, and xAI planning to expand its Memphis, Tennessee, data center to 1 million GPUs.\n\nAI data centers are huge energy hogs, so expect soaring electricity demand. Data centers could consume up to 9% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, more than double today\u2019s amount, says energy research outfit EPRI. To achieve this will require tens of billions of dollars of investment in energy and grid expansion. Data centers will spur demand for reliable power, especially sourced from natural gas. Set to benefit: Constellation Energy, Vistra, ExxonMobil, Entergy and Talen Energy.\n\nProjected energy needs are so big that tech giants are serious about using nuclear to power nearby data centers. Google wants to add 500 megawatts of nuclear energy with Kairos Power\u2019s small modular reactors by 2035. Amazon has similar agreements in Virginia and Washington and is investing in nuclear firm X-energy. Meta has a proposal to add 1-4 gigawatts of nuclear capacity by the early 2030s. In a $1.6 billion deal, Microsoft partnered with Constellation Energy to restart a Three Mile Island reactor. Data center operator Equinix has signed a deal with microreactor maker Oklo.\n\nEven with big energy investments, power shortages will be a bottleneck for AI development. Chips are sure to get more energy-efficient, but not fast enough to curb demand in the near term. Nuclear won\u2019t make an impact until the 2030s.\n\nAI takes hold\n\nFor an early sign of what\u2019s to come, look at top AI models that are emerging fast. The tools can create stunning virtual 3D worlds, lifelike voice assistants, Hollywood-like movies, full-length books and more. Google\u2019s recent Genie model can create 3D video games, animations and prototypes by inputting simple text or images, such as writing \u201cShow me a wizard walking through an ancient forest.\u201d\n\nOpenAI, Google, Amazon and others are regularly releasing newly improved tools, from low-cost ones for mobile devices to expensive ones with high-end performance. Meta\u2019s top AI models are open-source, so they are freely available, a contrast with the others\u2019 proprietary efforts, spelling even more competition and choices.\n\nThe tech is quickly being embedded in everyday apps and services, including Microsoft 365\u2019s suite of word processing and other apps, web browsers and mobile operating systems from Apple and Android. The tools can write emails, summarize documents, edit photos, create presentations, answer questions, etc.\n\nUnlike social media and web search, the business model can\u2019t be free and reliant on ads because building leading-edge AI is so expensive. Subscriptions are a top option, especially for business users wanting powerful AI for specific tasks. OpenAI announced a $200-per-month subscription for its top AI model, for example.\n\nAI start-ups keep scoring huge sums based on the disruptive potential to shake up entire markets, such as online search, and take on incumbent services, such as sales software. Among the start-ups with valuations in the billions are Glean, Hugging Face, Databricks, CoreWeave, Safe Superintelligence, Poolside and Liquid AI. Venture capitalists and large companies are among the investors. Another example: Tenstorrent recently raised $700 million to build more affordable advanced AI chips.\n\nThe race to super AI\n\nIs AI on the path to superintelligence? A lot of top researchers think so. Many companies\u2019 goal is creating so-called artificial general intelligence, an AI that cracks the code of human intelligence, and then improves upon it. OpenAI defines AGI as \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d Others say it\u2019s a Ph.D.-level virtual genius.\n\nThis ill-defined inflection point has an uncertain timeline, which ranges from next year to sometime in the next decade, or being delayed indefinitely, say its advocates.\n\nIn theory, AGI poses endless possibilities but also dire existential risks. The promise includes rapid productivity gains and booming economic growth, as scientific discovery is accelerated to cure cancer, solve nuclear fusion, etc. Dangers include self-aware AI going rogue, starting a war or even ending humanity.\n\nTake AGI talk seriously, but with a healthy dose of skepticism. AI hype is partly at play, though the race to AGI will be a driving force for years to come. Past AI hype has fallen flat and decades of research have seen fits and starts. AGI isn\u2019t required for amazing AI tech emerging from steady advances. The pressing risk for society is how humans decide to use powerful AI.\n\nThe emerging use cases\n\nThere\u2019s a rapidly growing list of uses for generative AI across industries. It will become a powerful tool for knowledge workers. Widely available tools can already transcribe virtual meetings, analyze company data, find cyber threats, research new markets and more. Users interact with AI chatbots like web search typing text to get responses. More questions or commands can refine the results\u2026 \u201cprovide more details,\u201d \u201csimplify the text for a nonexpert,\u201d \u201cwhat am I missing?\u201d etc.\n\nThere\u2019s an explosion of AI apps and business adoption is ramping up, though it will be a bumpy ride finding the best-use cases and ways to train workers.\n\nSpecific areas where AI will gain traction:\n\nInformation technology. Writing and debugging computer code is one of the top uses to boost productivity. Users can paste sections of code to check for errors or input text to build an app. Among the vendors are GitHub, Codeium, Cursor, Harness, All Hands and Factory.\n\nWriting and debugging computer code is one of the top uses to boost productivity. Users can paste sections of code to check for errors or input text to build an app. Among the vendors are GitHub, Codeium, Cursor, Harness, All Hands and Factory. Media and entertainment. Create a full-length film from a text description. Hollywood will let fans personalize movies, simply entering something such as, \u201cMake a Superman film about sharing, suitable for an 8-year-old,\u201d into a generative AI tool. Movie special effects will be easier. Ditto, commercials, video games, etc. AI tools include Runway, Midjourney, Canva, Pika and Ideogram.\n\nCreate a full-length film from a text description.

Ditto for students, who can get bullet points from a long text or help with an essay. Personalized AI tutors such as Khanmigo break down complex topics step by step. Healthcare. Tools can transcribe audio of patient visits, send messages or automate notetaking. They can streamline required reporting or help with diagnoses. AI tool Whisper is already widely used. Others include Abridge, Forcura and SmarterDx.\n\nThere are many other areas, including legal, finance, pharma, real estate and publishing. AI can pore through scientific papers for insights, or make models of drug molecules. It can give suggestions to deal with a mountain of regulations and compliance tasks.\n\n\n\nThe Holy Grail is autonomous AI assistants that can do complex work. These \u201cagents\u201d will take control of a computer to pull up documents and websites to book hotels, schedule meetings, do work research and more, completely on their own, while keeping the human in the loop. They\u2019ll call customer service for any issues, and AI may even talk to other AI. Assistants may become intimate virtual friends who understand tone and mood. And every worker could have a tireless assistant.\n\nIntensifying global competition\n\nWhen it comes to global AI competition, the U.S. has a dominant lead by almost every notable measure, including investment, leading-edge AI systems, data centers, start-ups and jobs, according to a Stanford University AI Index Report. China ranks second in recent power rankings, but as an example of our edge, the U.S. had nearly nine times the private investment in 2023. Rounding out the top 10 rankings: the U.K., India, United Arab Emirates, France, South Korea, Germany, Japan and Singapore.\n\nStill, Chinese tech giants are rapidly launching and improving AI models, including ones from Alibaba, Baidu, ByteDance, Huawei and Tencent. Those tools are already used by hundreds of millions of Chinese users and lots of Chinese firms. No doubt such tech is being widely tested and used by the Chinese government.\n\nThe U.S. Dept. of Defense is planning a military AI arms race with China, spurring a flurry of activity by the Pentagon that will only accelerate. There are even concerns China could beat the U.S. to an AGI-type breakthrough. In 2023, the DoD launched a generative AI task force and has since unveiled projects for military chatbots that can assist with acquisitions, sift through intelligence, answer research questions, analyze data, provide insights for decision-making, etc.\n\nOther ideas: Using AI for autonomous weapons, virtual assistants on the battlefield, tracking terrorist activities, cybersecurity defenses and satellite imagery analysis.\n\nBig defense contractors and start-ups are racing to build military AI tools. Lockheed Martin and Leidos are working on secure software products. Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others with leading AI models are aiming for contracts, including through partnerships. For example, big data analytics company Palantir has partnered with Anthropic to provide AI to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies to process huge amounts of data, uncover patterns, streamline documents and more. Other vendors in the military market include Shield AI, Anduril, Scale AI, Pryzm and Ask Sage.\n\nExpect military and government leaders to express rising levels of concern on both the risks of using AI and the risks of foreign adversaries embracing the tech. Military leaders are worried about unreliable or inaccurate AI-generated responses, so they\u2019ll tread lightly before relying on AI-generated insight for high-level decisions. The Pentagon\u2019s research arm will spend billions of dollars rigorously testing AI for reliability and trustworthiness. Federal efforts to conduct AI safety tests in classified settings are underway, such as identifying how much info AI models have about nuclear weapons and whether it presents a pressing national security risk.\n\nThe many looming challenges\n\nOf course, this breakthrough tech brings a myriad of knotty challenges.\n\nGenerative AI will be used for propaganda and to interfere in democracy, since it\u2019s so easy, fast and cheap to create a tsunami of convincing AI propaganda, including text, images, videos and audio. For example, China meddling in Taiwan\u2019s elections. Or Russia having an easier time launching cyberattacks via AI-created e-mails.\n\nAI advances could hit roadblocks. Energy and chip shortages may happen. Companies are running out of data on the internet to train models. There are worries that AI progress may stall as current methods hit a wall. Many worry about the risk of onerous regs slowing progress, spending drying up or looming AI talent shortages. Uses that boost productivity could take longer than expected to gain wide adoption.\n\nOther top concerns relate to privacy, intellectual property, cybersecurity and misinformation from AI that has gobbled up data with little to no oversight, as well as job losses from AI automation and mindless AI spam flooding the internet.\n\nBut many of these problems have solutions and they don\u2019t negate AI's potential.\n\nThis forecast is from the team at The Kiplinger Letter, which has been running since 1923.

            "content": "Serie A Preview: Napoli vs Juventus \u2013 Team News, Line-ups & Prediction\n\nOne of the most heavily anticipated fixtures in the Serie A calendar takes place at Stadio Diego Maradona on Saturday as pacesetters Napoli take on top-four hopefuls Juventus.\n\nNapoli consolidated their Scudetto credentials with a morale-boosting 3-2 win against fellow title rivals Atalanta last weekend. Despite falling behind, courtesy of Mateo Retegui\u2019s 14th Serie A goal this season, Antonio Conte\u2019s side turned the game on its head before halftime.\n\nMatteo Politano and Scott McTominay scored before the break, only for Ademola Lookman to draw Atalanta level. However, Romelu Lukaku shrugged off Giorgio Scalvini to head home a late winner, sealing Napoli\u2019s sixth consecutive league win for the first time since February 2023.\n\nIn search of good omens, Napoli won the title that year. They aim to replicate that success this term after maintaining a three-point lead on runners-up Inter, albeit having played a game more. Juventus put Inter\u2019s arch-rivals Milan to the sword last weekend in Turin.\n\nSecond-half blitz from Samuel Mbangula and Tim Weah inspired Thiago Motta\u2019s \u2018stalemate kings\u2019 to a 2-0 home win, helping them close the gap on fourth-placed Lazio to only two points. It was supposed to be a turning point for Juventus, but they would soon \u2018return to normal.\u2019\n\nIndeed, one of the most disappointing matches in midweek Champions League action saw the Bianconeri share the spoils with Club Brugge in a 0-0 draw at the Jan Breydel Stadium, inflicting substantial damage on their hopes of securing automatic Round-of-16 qualification.\n\nMatch Preview\n\nNapoli\n\nConte couldn\u2019t have imagined a better response from his side following Khvicha Kvaratskhelia\u2019s transfer to Paris Saint-Germain than beating high-flying Atalanta. More importantly, Napoli claimed an away win against high-profile opposition for the first time in a while ahead of the impending home return.\n\nWithout the distraction of European football, Napoli will rely on fresh legs to strengthen their impressive home league record this season (W8, L2). Indeed, they\u2019ve picked up the division\u2019s joint-high 24 points on home turf, largely thanks to an impregnable backline. No team has conceded fewer home goals than Napoli\u2019s six.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s barely surprising that only two of their 12 home outings this season have seen both teams on the scoresheet, highlighting the significance of drawing first blood. Napoli can take further confidence from beating Juventus \u2018to one\u2019 across their last three top-flight meetings in Naples.\n\nJuventus\n\nWould you be surprised to know that September\u2019s reverse fixture finished 0-0? Draws have been a common theme for Juventus this season, with an incredible 13 of their 21 top-flight outings ending level. As such, being the only unbeaten Serie A team couldn\u2019t count for less, especially when factoring in a substantial 13-point deficit on Napoli pre-round.\n\nAnother stalemate is well on the cards. Juventus have shared the spoils in seven of their last eight away games in all competitions (W1), with only one featuring over 2.5 goals. With that in mind, fans in attendance may not be in for a spectacle, even though their last three league encounters in Naples produced 3+ goals and both teams on the scoresheet.\n\nOn a rare positive note, Juventus haven\u2019t lost a competitive match on the road since April 2024 against Lazio. Any hope of winning at this stadium for the first time since March 2019 and, in turn, halting a five-game losing H2H away streak will hinge on the visitors\u2019 ability to rediscover their scoring instincts.\n\nJuventus have netted one goal or fewer on seven of their nine road trips since the start of November.\n\nTeam News\n\nJuan Jesus will likely join forces with Amir Rrahmani at the back as Napoli are still without star center-back Alessandro Buongiorno. Left-back Mathias Olivera is also out. As for winter signings Philip Billing and Luis Hasa, they should start on the bench.\n\nOn the other hand, long-term absentees Arkadiusz Milik, Juan Cabal, and Gleison Bremer remain unavailable for selection. Encouragingly for Motta, Francisco Conceicao and Kenan Yildiz will be at his disposal after overcoming minor fitness problems.\n\nNapoli vs Juventus Potential Starting Line-ups\n\nNapoli (4-2-3-1): Meret; Di Lorenzo, Rrahmani, Jesus, Olivera; Anguissa, Lobotka; Politano, McTominay, Neres; Lukaku.\n\nNapoli vs Juventus Prediction\n\nNapoli\u2019s recent home record against Juventus is too telling to be overlooked. Conte has instilled his winning mentality in the locker room, and if there\u2019s a side capable of inflicting Juve\u2019s first league defeat under Motta, it\u2019s the Partenopei.",

(AP Photo/Jessica Hill) Jessica Hill/Associated Press\n\nOMAHA, Neb. \u2014 Caroline Ducharme is \"one step\" closer to returning to the court for the first time since November 2023.\n\nThe redshirt junior guard participated in pregame warmups Saturday ahead of UConn women\u2019s basketball\u2019s victory at Creighton in Omaha. It was the first time Ducharme was seen actively participating in warmups since November 2023.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Milton, Mass. native played the first four games of the 2023-24 season before taking a medical redshirt and sitting out the remainder of the year due to neck/back injuries.\n\nDucharme spent all last summer and the beginning half of this season working on recovering and getting back to the court. She was seen during a few of the media-viewing portions of practice earlier this season doing dynamic stretching on the side or getting stationary shots up. Geno Auriemma said during this time that Ducharme has also been the ultimate teammate despite not being able to play.\n\n\u201cShe just wants to play so much,\u201d Auriemma said on Jan. 7. \u201cAnd I would tell you, if you asked our players, who's the best teammate on the team right now, they would tell you, Caroline. She's just been unbelievable. For a kid who's not playing, she is a perfect role model, perfect example of what true, selfless leadership really is. \u2018I can't play but I'm going to help all you guys be better.\u2019 Just the way she talks to them, the way she interacts with them. She's just been absolutely phenomenal. I'm so, so proud of her.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nOn Saturday, Ducharme was dressed in UConn\u2019s typical warmup attire even with her No. 33 jersey peaking out underneath her shirt. Auriemma said it was a \"step in the right direction\" for the guard but did not provide specific updates on Ducharme\u2019s return-to-play timeline.\n\n\u201cShe practices as much as she can, whenever she can, and I know she's been anxious to take the next step, whatever that next step is,\u201d Auriemma said Saturday. \u201cAnd today that next step was, \u2018Let's go down the court and give it a try and see how it works.\u2019 I'm sure she was probably the most excited that you can imagine. So, let's see where this takes us. See what the next step beyond this one is.\u201d\n\nDucharme appeared comfortable and in good spirits during warm-ups as she did the Huskies\u2019 pregame running, shooting and passing drills.\n\n\u201cJust to know all that she's going through, what she went through, and how hard she's working to get back, the baby milestones and the steps to getting back on the floor, even if it\u2019s just warmups is a huge step,\u201d Paige Bueckers said Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely proud of her and happy for her.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe guard has missed significant time during her first three seasons in Storrs due to concussions, neck injuries and back spasms. Due to the severity of those injuries, her recovery has sidelined her for long periods of time.\n\n\u201cIt's been hard. Just the ups and downs of it, but I am really lucky to be surrounded by the people I am,\u201d Ducharme said before UConn\u2019s 2023-24 season opener. \u201cI don't think I would be in the place that I am, in the mindset that I'm in today if I didn't have the people around me, my teammates, my coaches to support me; trainers, Hudy (Andrea Hudy, UConn\u2019s Director of Sports Performance), everybody just being there for me and just like knowing that I'm going to get back to it.\u201d\n\nDucharme started all four of the games she played last season, averaging 4.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, 0.75 steals and 0.5 assists in 14.5 minutes per game. However, on the plane ride to the Cayman Islands for the Huskies\u2019 Thanksgiving tournament, turbulence during the flight re-aggregated her injuries and sidelined her for the rest of the year.\n\nThe guard missed four games as a freshman in 2021-22 due to a concussion and 17 her sophomore year due to neck stiffness and another concussion. She also sat out two of UConn\u2019s four exhibition games during its European Trip in the Summer of 2023 after getting hit in the head with the ball.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDuring the 54 career games she\u2019s played for UConn in the past three years, she\u2019s started 18 and averaged 8.7 points, 3.5 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 0.70 steals in 21.3 minutes per game.\n\nBecause of the redshirt year last season, Ducharme has an additional year of eligibility remaining after the 2024-25 season if she chooses to return for a fifth year.\n\n\u201cKnowing Caroline, if on March 1 she goes, \u2018I'm good to go.\u2019 She'll want to play in the Big East Tournament in the NCAA Tournament,\u201d Auriemma said on Jan. 7. \u201cCaroline just loves to play.

            "content": "In a monumental shift that could reshape the financial future of millions of government employees, the Central Government has formally introduced the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS). This new scheme aims to address longstanding concerns with the National Pension System (NPS) while offering employees a choice: stick with the old system or embrace this revamped framework.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another tweak in policy\u2014it\u2019s a watershed moment in India\u2019s pension landscape. The scheme, notified recently, is being seen as a bridge between the past and the future, blending the stability of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) with the flexibility of the NPS, all while introducing a fresh perspective on retirement security. Here TICE brings you key details of the scheme.\n\nThe Big Choice: What\u2019s in It for Employees?\n\nUnder the newly notified scheme, the government has introduced two distinct options for employees currently under the NPS. They can either:\n\nStay with NPS: Continuing with the existing system where retirement benefits are driven by employee contributions matched by the government. Opt for UPS: Transition to a new structure offering two components: Individual Corpus : Built through contributions from both the employee and the Central Government.\n\n: Built through contributions from both the employee and the Central Government. Pooled Corpus: An additional contribution from the government to bolster retirement benefits.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. Employees who choose UPS will forgo the possibility of future concessions or policy benefits post-retirement. It\u2019s a trade-off between guaranteed lifelong financial security and the uncertainty of potential policy evolutions.\n\nRead More: India Pavilion at Davos 2025: A Global Tech and Semiconductor Leader\n\nWhy the UPS? Understanding Its Genesis\n\nThe Unified Pension Scheme was born out of growing dissatisfaction among government employees with the NPS. Critics argued that the NPS, introduced in 2004, lacked the stability and predictability of the OPS, which guaranteed 50% of the last drawn salary as a lifelong pension.\n\nAcknowledging these concerns, the government formed a high-level panel headed by Cabinet Secretary T.V. Somanathan in August 2024. The result? The UPS, a scheme designed to offer a middle path\u2014balancing the sustainability of the NPS with the benefits of the OPS.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nOne standout feature is the retrospective coverage. Employees who retired under the NPS before the UPS rollout will also benefit. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has been tasked with devising mechanisms to provide these retirees with the additional top-up amounts they\u2019re now entitled to.\n\nRead More: DPIIT-Bhaane MoU: How It Will Shape the Future of Manufacturing Startups\n\nA Step Backward or Forward? Breaking Down the UPS\n\nThe UPS signifies one of the most significant policy reversals in two decades, harking back to a pension structure last seen during Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s tenure. Here\u2019s what makes it stand out:\n\nGuaranteed Pension : Employees who retire under the UPS will receive 50% of their last drawn salary as a lifelong pension.\n\n: Employees who retire under the UPS will receive 50% of their last drawn salary as a lifelong pension. Dearness Relief : Periodic hikes linked to inflation will ensure the pension retains its value over time.\n\n: Periodic hikes linked to inflation will ensure the pension retains its value over time. Family Pension : In case of a retiree\u2019s demise, the family will receive 60% of the pension amount.\n\n: In case of a retiree\u2019s demise, the family will receive 60% of the pension amount. Minimum Pension Guarantee : Even employees with a relatively short tenure (at least 10 years) will receive a minimum pension of \u20b910,000 per month.\n\n: Even employees with a relatively short tenure (at least 10 years) will receive a minimum pension of \u20b910,000 per month. Gratuity Benefits: Superannuation payouts coupled with gratuity benefits will provide a substantial financial cushion.\n\nThe Union Cabinet\u2019s approval of the UPS signals more than just a policy change\u2014it reflects a commitment to the financial security of government employees. In a country where debates around pensions often oscillate between fiscal prudence and social responsibility, the UPS strikes a delicate balance.\n\nThe scheme's introduction also serves as a recognition of the critical role government employees play in nation-building. It reinforces the government's message: their service will not go unappreciated, even in retirement.\n\nRead More: Rupee vs Dollar: Why a Weaker Rupee Isn\u2019t Always an Export Booster\n\nChallenges and Questions Ahead\n\nDespite its promise, the UPS raises critical questions. How sustainable is this scheme in the long run, especially given India\u2019s growing workforce? Can it maintain its financial commitments without burdening future generations?\n\nMoreover, the voluntary nature of the scheme means its success depends on how many employees opt in. Will the allure of guaranteed lifelong pensions outweigh the uncertainties of sticking to the NPS?\n\nAs the UPS rolls out, employees are weighing their options. Financial advisors and union leaders are poring over the finer details to help workers make informed choices. For the government, this marks a defining moment\u2014not just in pension policy but also in its relationship with public servants.\n\nWith its guaranteed pension benefits, inflation-linked hikes, and comprehensive family support, the UPS might just set a new benchmark for retirement policies in India. Only time will tell whether it lives up to its promise of bridging the past and the future, but one thing is certain: the conversation around pensions in India will never be the same again.\n\nJoin Our Thriving Entrepreneurial Community\n\nTwitter: @TiceNews | LinkedIn: TICE News | Instagram: @tice.news | Google: Leave a Review",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nGround delivery costs are projected to drop slightly year over year in Q1 despite recent rate increases from FedEx, UPS and other carriers, according to the TD Cowen/AFS Freight Index released Jan. 14.\n\nThe index forecasts per-package ground delivery rates are estimated to reach 28.2% above the index's January 2018 baseline for the quarter. That's down from 28.8% in Q1 2024, due to persistent shipping discounts from carriers over the past year.\n\nAFS Logistics summed up the overall parcel market as \"one of low demand, intense competition and persistent discounting activity\u201d in the release.\n\nDiscounts curb ground shipping costs TD Cowen/AFS Ground Parcel Freight Index versus January 2018 baseline\n\nDive Insight:\n\nShippers appear to still have leverage to negotiate more favorable delivery rates in 2025. But how long discounting activity will continue is a major question facing the parcel market this year, Mingshu Bates, AFS' chief analytics officer and president of parcel, said in the release.\n\n\"Carriers are continuing to communicate an emphasis on revenue quality, which would indicate tighter pricing control as the year progresses and continued pricing changes throughout the year,\" Bates said.\n\nFor now, aggressive discounting activity is lowering both ground and express shipping costs. The express parcel rate per package fell in Q4 to 0.5% above the January 2018 baseline. Annual price increases are projected to bring the number up to 4.1% in Q1, although that would still equate to a year over year decline from Q1 2024\u2019s 4.5%.\n\n\"The Express parcel market is expected to stay highly competitive, driven by continued pressure from regional carriers, Amazon and the USPS, with aggressive discounting expected to persist into 2025,\" according to an AFS presentation on the index.\n\nEven with heightened discounts, expanded surcharges from FedEx and UPS have taken a bite out of shippers' savings, particularly during the holiday shipping rush.\n\nThe Q4 ground parcel rate per package was 24.4%, which surpassed projections and marked an increase from 23.8% the year prior. Added fees levied during the holidays resulted in the average accessorial charge per ground package climbing 16.4% from Q3 to Q4, according to AFS.\n\nThat increase likely benefited carriers \u2014 in mid-December, FedEx projected that peak season demand surcharge revenue would grow year over year, EVP and Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on an earnings call.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve interviewed Gary Stevenson three times. First in 2020 about global finance being screwed with a capital \u201cS\u201d; again in 2022 about the cost of living crisis; and then last year when he published The Trading Game, his compelling memoir about life as a trader at Citibank. Now I\u2019m meeting him for the first time in the flesh, ahead of the book\u2019s appearance in paperback, and we\u2019re talking about yet another crisis.\n\n\u201cHave you seen the news?\u201d is the first thing he asks, presenting it like a challenge even before he says \u201chello\u201d. I rack my brain distressingly slowly, like a librarian using a card index for the very first time, thinking: which bit of the news? LA is on fire; Gaza is on fire; Ukraine is on fire; a bunch of Teslas are on fire. Seriously, we\u2019ve all seen a lot of news.\n\n\u201cTraders are about to bring down the government,\u201d he says.\n\nOh, that news. \u201cThey\u2019re selling the bonds,\u201d Stevenson reminds me. \u201cNot with the same speed as with Truss, but they\u2019re selling them. Interest rates are at 4.9% this morning. In my opinion, and the opinion of most unbiased economists, the government can\u2019t afford to fund itself at 4.9%.\u201d\n\nThere are fundamentals here that I\u2019m embarrassed to admit I don\u2019t really get. Part of the appeal of Stevenson \u2013 who, despite being 38, reminds me of a young Mike Skinner, with his hoodie, trainers, buzz cut and intensity leavened with insistent humour \u2013 is that he doesn\u2019t mind. He doesn\u2019t really think anybody gets it except him. \u201cNobody on the whole fucking left understands what\u2019s happening on the financial markets except me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m on all these left-wing WhatsApp groups, I\u2019ve had spads messaging me, saying: \u2018What can we say?\u2019 Because I\u2019m the only guy that knows. And I\u2019ve been screaming, for months: \u2018Watch the bond yields, watch the bond yields, watch the bond yields.\u2019\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen \u2018The government is playing chess with no pieces\u2019 \u2026 Gary Stevenson. Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\nBut why wouldn\u2019t the markets just give a rightish-centre-left, completely unradical, relatively new government a chance? \u201cTraders individually are smart people, but the market itself is a little bit of a wild beast. But the thing is, the traders are probably right. If you look at the UK government, it\u2019s not on a sustainable financial path. There\u2019s been no sustained growth in this country for a long time. The government\u2019s stripped to its bones. The middle class is dying. Where\u2019s the growth going to come from? What is the actual plan here?\u201d\n\nMarket movements, market trends: these are all just a disembodied way of saying \u201crich people\u201d. And Stevenson knows a lot about the rich. After all, he\u2019s one of them, thanks to his years at Citibank and an even more profitable second act trading for his own account. Since 2020 he\u2019s been running a YouTube channel, GarysEconomics, explaining to his 620,000 subscribers how the rich have grabbed everyone else\u2019s money.\n\n\u201cThe rich have got a choice,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can lend the money to the government or they can buy the assets. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, what\u2019s that?\u201d I ask, trepidatiously, knowing the answer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m buying the assets. Stocks, gold, commodities, property, everything. The rich have got a lot of money, they can buy everything. The government has got to compete with that. They can\u2019t. They\u2019re trying to play chess with no pieces.\u201d\n\nStevenson\u2019s is an incredible story. He was born in Ilford in east London: \u201cI grew up in a tiny little bedroom. I had one drawer under my bed with everything I owned in it. I\u2019m not good at owning shit, I\u2019m not good at decorating shit, I\u2019m good at talking about economics.\u201d He is expelled from grammar school, gets into LSE anyway, wins an internship at Citibank on a card game, gets a job, becomes the most profitable trader at the bank in 2011, is a multimillionaire by his mid-20s, has a mighty clash with the bank and then a breakdown but walks away the winner anyway. None of that is a spoiler for his book, I don\u2019t think, because the real drama is what\u2019s happening to the economy.\n\n\u201cI pitched this book to Penguin in 2022,\u201d he says, \u201cand said to them, \u2018If you think the economy is bad now, wait until this book comes out. Politics and economics are increasingly gonna be everything people care about, because this gets worse. The world\u2019s falling apart, and it\u2019s not gonna get better.\u2019\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to build something about inequality and taxing the rich, and I\u2019m going to build it on YouTube\n\nSix months after The Trading Game was published, former colleagues lined up to tell the Mail and the Financial Times it was nonsense. He had never been the best trader at Citibank, they said, and it wasn\u2019t even possible for him to know either way. And besides, his mentor and colleague Billy (a pseudonym) was. \u201cIt\u2019s such a trader response,\u201d he says, \u201cthat they\u2019ve zoned in on this: \u2018He wasn\u2019t the best trader.\u2019 You write a book, basically saying the global economy\u2019s going to collapse. And they\u2019re like, \u2018He\u2019s not the best trader.\u2019 It\u2019s the only thing they can say: \u2018I made more money than you.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe stands by his claims, \u201cbut it can make a person go mad, to be called a liar, again and again\u201d.\n\nWhile living in Japan with his girlfriend, called Wizard in the book, Stevenson had a breakdown, which was a long time in the making. Before he\u2019d left for Tokyo, he\u2019d fallen out and stopped living with a family friend, who was younger than him. \u201cWhen we had this big split, he called me and said, \u2018You fucking need me.\u2019 And it\u2019s right, in a way; I looked after him like a father, and he kept me human. When he goes, life is nothing but the numbers.\u201d\n\nHe was already embroiled in a battle with his employers, who didn\u2019t want to pay his astronomical bonuses unless he stayed. This is apparently very common in the City, and maybe doesn\u2019t come up in conversation much because people making huge bonuses never want to leave.\n\nHe describes one meeting he had with HR, all of which he spent staring at a desk-photo of the HR manager\u2019s family. He does an impression of himself, staring. It is funny, and it is genuinely unsettling. \u201cI didn\u2019t keep it together, but I still got the money, didn\u2019t I? There was a wonderful reclamation of humanity through defeating these guys by being mad, rather than by playing their game. I was born and raised poor in London. I went to grammar school, got judged for being poor. I got expelled from school, I went to LSE, I went to Citibank: everybody was always richer than me. I had to study for my exams sat on my bedroom floor. There\u2019s this thing for young people: work harder, be better. And I was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m just going to be an idiot.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe came out of it depressed, weighing eight stone, isolated, behaving erratically. \u201cIt\u2019s about a total numbness, feeling nothing. You don\u2019t care if you haven\u2019t eaten for five days, you don\u2019t care if you haven\u2019t brushed your teeth \u2013 it\u2019s a total separation from the world. If you can enable people who\u2019ve never experienced depression to in some way feel it, that would be a service. I don\u2019t want people to sit listening to Prince William on a podcast \u2013 I want you to be there. I want you to be a little bit confused, because I was confused. I was a multimillionaire in my mid-20s, I had a beautiful girlfriend, and I was unhappy.\u201d\n\nAfter doing an MPhil in economics in Oxford, he came back to London, bouncing between friends\u2019 sofas before moving back into his flat in Limehouse \u2013 a stone\u2019s throw from Citibank\u2019s offices in Canary Wharf and bought with his ginormous bonus. It was ground zero for the irrationality of his experience, \u201cto devote your youth to getting good at something, and the culmination of that thing being simultaneously realising that the global economy is gonna collapse and being paid \u00a32m. \u2018You are the best at this thing, you are totally right, the global economy\u2019s going to collapse. Here\u2019s \u00a32m \u2013 go do it again.\u2019\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A fan takes a selfie with Stevenson in Canary Wharf. Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\nAs for why he still lives there two years later: \u201cThese skyscrapers [in Canary Wharf], they went up when me and my school friends were seven or eight. We could see them in the distance, on the horizon, from Ilford. We felt like it belonged to us. For me, Canary Wharf is a shitty, plastic place but I fucking killed that shitty, plastic place.\u201d\n\nStevenson still makes a lot of money trading, which he does \u201cto demonstrate to myself that I\u2019m not insane. A lot of people can say pessimistic things, but not a lot of them can make hundreds of thousands of pounds every year on financial markets. I don\u2019t just say these things; I bet on them. And I make money every year. You can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re not right. If you made every economist who chats shit on the media bet their own personal money on what they\u2019re saying, there\u2019d be a lot less bullshit on the news.\u201d\n\nBut his sights are all on politics. \u201cAndrew Tate is seeing the same thing I\u2019m seeing. Politics is dying,\u201d he says. \u201cThe far right are settling now. They know what their plan is: anti-immigration is the big idea, Muslims are the bad guys, tariffs. There is a battle of ideas in society, but there is a battle of ideas on the left. I\u2019m putting my pitch forward \u2013 I\u2019m going to build something about inequality, taxing the rich, and I\u2019m going to build it on YouTube. These are very ambitious plans, but what else am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\nWait a second: does he actually want to be prime minister? \u201cThis is quite a simple idea: if you don\u2019t do something about inequality, it will get worse, and living standards will continue to fall. That idea is pretty simple. It doesn\u2019t need to be all on my shoulders. I\u2019m trying to set a fire under the people. I\u2019m trying to get them pumped on it.\u201d It may be the first thing he\u2019s said that\u2019s not quite an answer.",

00:03:41,239\n\nWorks began a series of thrift shops and\n\n89\n\n00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,599\n\nalso opens up a bookstore Cafe which are\n\n90\n\n00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,439\n\num probably the most visible piece of\n\n91\n\n00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720\n\nHousing Works um not everybody knows\n\n92\n\n00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,920\n\nabout the healthcare and the case\n\n93\n\n00:03:46,720

00:05:45,000\n\ncrazy sounding and that goes back to the\n\n142\n\n00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,080\n\nactivist history you know just a quick\n\n143\n\n00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,199\n\naside in the 90s the Julia ma the\n\n144\n\n00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,440\n\nGiuliani Administration wanted to shut\n\n145\n\n00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,440\n\ndown Housing Works because we were um

00:06:33,560\n\ncannabis to dispensary in there and we\n\n163\n\n00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,599\n\nwere all like huh what you know but he\n\n164\n\n00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,560\n\nknew it was coming um it took a while\n\n165\n\n00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:40,720\n\nthere were a few false starts you know\n\n166\n\n00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,120\n\nthe bill died in 20 uh I forget the\n\n167\n\n00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,560\n\nexact year and then they had to bring it\n\n168\n\n00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,240\n\nback the next year you know it was\n\n169\n\n00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,680\n\ncoming and we were able to open because\n\n170\n\n00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,919\n\nNew York state was very intentional\n\n171\n\n00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,120\n\naround its social Equity goals for\n\n172\n\n00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,680\n\ncannabis so they reserved a large chunk\n\n173\n\n00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,360\n\nof licenses to give to people who had\n\n174\n\n00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,319\n\nfaced uh\n\n175\n\n00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,560\n\ndisproportionate harms especially by the\n\n176\n\n00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,360\n\ncaused by the War on Drugs a lot of\n\n177\n\n00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,680\n\nlicenses were reserved for people who\n\n178\n\n00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,800\n\nhad a cannabis conviction on their\n\n179\n\n00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,319\n\nrecord some licenses were also reserved\n\n180\n\n00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,160\n\nfor veterans um distressed farmers and a\n\n181\n\n00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,000\n\nfew other groups a small number of\n\n182\n\n00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240\n\nlicenses were also reserved for\n\n183\n\n00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,199\n\nnonprofits that helped some of the uh\n\n184\n\n00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,800\n\nmost vulnerable and impacted people\n\n185\n\n00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,599\n\nthat's who Housing Works has been\n\n186\n\n00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,039\n\nserving for 35 years you know people\n\n187\n\n00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,240\n\nliving in poverty experiencing\n\n188\n\n00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,479\n\nmarginalization incarceration you name\n\n189\n\n00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,440\n\nit so it was this beautiful um\n\n190\n\n00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,759\n\nintersection of our mission but also the\n\n191\n\n00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,360\n\nfact that we knew how to do New York\n\n192\n\n00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,599\n\nCity retail because we've been doing it\n\n193\n\n00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,639\n\nfor three decades in that sense it was\n\n194\n\n00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,840\n\npretty easy to get the license and it\n\n195\n\n00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,879\n\nalso helped that we pledged to help get\n\n196\n\n00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,039\n\nthat dispensary open by the end of 2022\n\n197\n\n00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,000\n\nwhich was a thing that the governor\n\n198\n\n00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,440\n\nreally wanted to see because the roll\n\n199\n\n00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,319\n\nout was like two years behind at that\n\n200\n\n00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,120\n\npoint and so we got that license right\n\n201\n\n00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,440\n\nbefore Thanksgiving and we opened four\n\n202\n\n00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,879\n\nweeks later which is also crazy but\n\n203\n\n00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,120\n\nthat's kind of how we operated Al LS and\n\n204\n\n00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,400\n\nI'm kind of going to jump around here\n\n205\n\n00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,479\n\nbut because you said two things that I\n\n206\n\n00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,400\n\nwant to nail on that I actually think\n\n207\n\n00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,159\n\nare uniquely difficult the first one is\n\n208\n\n00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,240\n\nsocial Equity social Equity is always a\n\n209\n\n00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,520\n\nhard conversation especially for\n\n210\n\n00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,039\n\nironically Legacy operators in the\n\n211\n\n00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,800\n\nindustry because they think the market\n\n212\n\n00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,879\n\nshould control let it be a free-for-all\n\n213\n\n00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,320\n\nLet It Be comp competitive no advantage\n\n214\n\n00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,880\n\nto anybody that's one position to take\n\n215\n\n00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,479\n\nbut I've always thought for social\n\n216\n\n00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,279\n\nEquity to work states and cities have to\n\n217\n\n00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,000\n\ndo more they can't just throw money at\n\n218\n\n00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,039\n\nthe issue they need to educate people\n\n219\n\n00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,680\n\nthey need to incubate I love it that New\n\n220\n\n00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,200\n\nYork set aside licenses for nonprofits\n\n221\n\n00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,480\n\nbecause I think they're the perfect\n\n222\n\n00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,760\n\nvehicle to achieve the goals of social\n\n223\n\n00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,760\n\nEquity because they're already\n\n224\n\n00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839\n\nstructured in such a way to support\n\n225\n\n00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,120\n\nthose missions they understand those\n\n226\n\n00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,560\n\nmissions I think you mentioned one of\n\n227\n\n00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,839\n\nthe housing work goals goals is to help\n\n228\n\n00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,680\n\nrehabilitate incarcerated people because\n\n229\n\n00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,720\n\nyou can't just get out of prison or jail\n\n230\n\n00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,920\n\nand know what you're doing in society\n\n231\n\n00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,760\n\nwhat do you think because now you've\n\n232\n\n00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,519\n\nbeen through it and New York is tough\n\n233\n\n00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,640\n\nbecause it's highly regulated what do\n\n234\n\n00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,880\n\nyou think kind of the magic potion is\n\n235\n\n00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,079\n\nfor social Equity to work because I'm\n\n236\n\n00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,160\n\nout of California it is not working it's\n\n237\n\n00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,600\n\nbeen an abject failure for a multitude\n\n238\n\n00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,160\n\nof reasons you know you can't really\n\n239\n\n00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,839\n\npoint the finger at one thing it's a\n\n240\n\n00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,839\n\nvery difficult socioeconomic problem you\n\n241\n\n00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,240\n\nknow industry in America don't just\n\n242\n\n00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,200\n\nBloom overnight it's very rare that you\n\n243\n\n00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,279\n\nget the chance to be a ground zero so\n\n244\n\n00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,200\n\nwhat do you think you know as a VP and\n\n245\n\n00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,600\n\nemployee at Housing Works what do you\n\n246\n\n00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,959\n\nthink the Special Sauce is for a better\n\n247\n\n00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,079\n\nsocial Equity setting woo big question\n\n248\n\n00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,880\n\nbig question Hillary I'll be first to\n\n249\n\n00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,480\n\nadmit that my knowledge is informed\n\n250\n\n00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,760\n\nreally by the New York experience uh\n\n251\n\n00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,680\n\npredominantly and and I think uh there's\n\n252\n\n00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,920\n\na lot of debate whether social Equity\n\n253\n\n00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,320\n\nhas worked in York or not um and a lot\n\n254\n\n00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,920\n\nof a lot of ink has been spilled about\n\n255\n\n00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,200\n\nNew York's very bumpy roll out I think\n\n256\n\n00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720\n\nthey did something and it was\n\n257\n\n00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,519\n\nintentional but it was far from perfect\n\n258\n\n00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,600\n\nso they reserved these licenses and it\n\n259\n\n00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,120\n\nwas meant to provide an on-ramp to\n\n260\n\n00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,800\n\npeople to open up their own dispensaries\n\n261\n\n00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,680\n\nand get established before eventually\n\n262\n\n00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,839\n\nmulti-state operators and others would\n\n263\n\n00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,399\n\ncome in and you know basically close up\n\n264\n\n00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,160\n\nthe opportunity that was good I think\n\n265\n\n00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,519\n\nsome of the criticisms have been that it\n\n266\n\n00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,959\n\nwas it was a slow process just on kind\n\n267\n\n00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,600\n\nof the the bureaucratic slog I I believe\n\n268\n\n00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,480\n\nsome of the criticism was that the the\n\n269\n\n00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,880\n\noffice of cannabis management was not\n\n270\n\n00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720\n\nsufficiently staffed up and prepared to\n\n271\n\n00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,399\n\njust process and move all this stuff\n\n272\n\n00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,880\n\nthrough a lot of criticism about lack of\n\n273\n\n00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,480\n\ntransparency people didn't really know\n\n274\n\n00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,480\n\nwhat was happening or when it was going\n\n275\n\n00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,440\n\nto happen there were also a lot of\n\n276\n\n00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,120\n\nresources that were promised to the uh\n\n277\n\n00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,519\n\nsocial Equity licenses the state said\n\n278\n\n00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,519\n\nthey were going to lease up properties\n\n279\n\n00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:12,320\n\nall over and help build them out and\n\n280\n\n00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:16,079\n\nhand them over to the the lies for a\n\n281\n\n00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,480\n\nsort of like a lowest loan situation and\n\n282\n\n00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,200\n\nthat never materialized there was a\n\n283\n\n00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,839\n\ninitially a hedge fund that was tasked\n\n284\n\n00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,200\n\nwith raising millions and millions of\n\n285\n\n00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,480\n\ndollars to fund that and it just didn't\n\n286\n\n00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,440\n\nhappen and it was assigned to sort a\n\n287\n\n00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,959\n\nsort of obscure New York agency that was\n\n288\n\n00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,360\n\nmeant to oversee it and they didn't\n\n289\n\n00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,760\n\noversee it well and and and the the\n\n290\n\n00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440\n\ndetails are like super boring unless\n\n291\n\n00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,200\n\nyou're into that stuff but but that's\n\n292\n\n00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,959\n\nkind of the problem right it gets lost\n\n293\n\n00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,600\n\nit sounds great on paper but it gets\n\n294\n\n00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,839\n\nlost in the bureaucracy and all of that\n\n295\n\n00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,160\n\nstuff and I will say that's kind of how\n\n296\n\n00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,800\n\nHousing Works stepped into this even\n\n297\n\n00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,600\n\nmore deeply I mean we're getting like\n\n298\n\n00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,839\n\nreally ahead of ourselves now but you\n\n299\n\n00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,160\n\nknow you have all these folks with\n\n300\n\n00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,440\n\nlicenses and and they and now they don't\n\n301\n\n00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,279\n\nknow what to do because they were\n\n302\n\n00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,399\n\npromised uh they were promised these low\n\n303\n\n00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,360\n\ninterest interest loans and they were\n\n304\n\n00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,760\n\npromised access to retail properties and\n\n305\n\n00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,440\n\nnone of that was materializing and now\n\n306\n\n00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,880\n\neverybody's looking for help and and\n\n307\n\n00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,360\n\npeople are getting all sorts of deals\n\n308\n\n00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,079\n\nthrown at them um anecdotally we heard\n\n309\n\n00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,440\n\nof all sorts of deals uh some which\n\n310\n\n00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,600\n\nsounded very\n\n311\n\n00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,680\n\npredatory one guy described it like this\n\n312\n\n00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,279\n\nhe said it's like I got a ticket to go\n\n313\n\n00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,800\n\non a cruise in the Caribbean except I\n\n314\n\n00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,440\n\nlive in New York and all I've got is a\n\n315\n\n00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,680\n\nbicycle now I need to figure out how to\n\n316\n\n00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,560\n\nget to Florida\n\n317\n\n00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,320\n\nwhich was a shame though that everybody\n\n318\n\n00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,440\n\nfound themselves in this situation the\n\n319\n\n00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,680\n\nother issue was that the office of\n\n320\n\n00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,519\n\ncannabis management wasn't disciplined\n\n321\n\n00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,639\n\nand airtight in how they

00:20:36,360\n\noperations that to to me recruiting the\n\n522\n\n00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,320\n\nbest manager you can is the is the\n\n523\n\n00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,960\n\nnumber one most important thing you can\n\n524\n\n00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,760\n\ndo and you know some owners are more\n\n525\n\n00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,919\n\nHands-On than others and I think the\n\n526\n\n00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,480\n\nowners who uh are more Hands-On with the\n\n527\n\n00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:52,400\n\ndaily operations face a steep learning\n\n528\n\n00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,240\n\ncurve because nobody's necessarily done\n\n529\n\n00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,640\n\nanything like this before and it's not\n\n530\n\n00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,240\n\nit's not a family business kind of thing\n\n531\n\n00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,240\n\nin the sense that that you can't just do\n\n532\n\n00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,480\n\nor not do whatever you want we've had to\n\n533\n\n00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,120\n\neducate for example that okay you have\n\n534\n\n00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,279\n\nan atwi employee you can terminate them\n\n535\n\n00:21:09,120 -->

because people are\n\n538\n\n00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,840\n\ngoing to sue you for\n\n539\n\n00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,799\n\nanything and they have grounds to sue\n\n540\n\n00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,159\n\nyou sometimes if you're not keeping\n\n541\n\n00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,760\n\ncareful documentation but documentation\n\n542\n\n00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,960\n\nso unsexy keeping a paper trail of your\n\n543\n\n00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,600\n\ncorrective actions and this and that is\n\n544\n\n00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,640\n\nso clerical I thought we were selling\n\n545\n\n00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,520\n\nweed are we just selling weed no you're\n\n546\n\n00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,840\n\nrunning you're running a complex retail\n\n547\n\n00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,320\n\noperation and um in in one of the most\n\n548\n\n00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,520\n\nlawsuit happy cities in states in the\n\n549\n\n00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,360\n\ncountry and that's the stuff you should\n\n550\n\n00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,799\n\nactually be worrying about but you know\n\n551\n\n00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,600\n\npeople are kind of surprised when they\n\n552\n\n00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,159\n\nhear that and that's just how works is\n\n553\n\n00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,080\n\ntake you know others might have\n\n554\n\n00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,679\n\ndifferent takes but well you know what\n\n555\n\n00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,640\n\nwe can bring is our experience to the\n\n556\n\n00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,000\n\ntable fair enough and

companies big or small they\n\n562\n\n00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,520\n\ntypically have a compliance person\n\n563\n\n00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,080\n\nwhether it's in-house or outsourced how\n\n564\n\n00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,760\n\nhard is it then I will say that the\n\n565\n\n00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,320\n\nOffice of cabis Management has been very\n\n566\n\n00:22:17,760 -->

know we're\n\n569\n\n00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,919\n\nwe're we're sort of building the ship as\n\n570\n\n00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,520\n\nwe're flying it to some extent and and\n\n571\n\n00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,400\n\nso they you know they have their\n\n572\n\n00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,159\n\nregulations and and so forth but they've\n\n573\n\n00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,880\n\nbeen they've been

on\n\n576\n\n00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,480\n\nwhat might be out of compliance and um\n\n577\n\n00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,480\n\nyou know do X Y and Z and get back into\n\n578\n\n00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,640\n\ncompliance they've been very\n\n579\n\n00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,120\n\nunderstanding which has been good for\n\n580\n\n00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,039\n\nour partners another unique Advantage\n\n581\n\n00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,640\n\nfor Housing Works was that we've been\n\n582\n\n00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,200\n\ndoing you know uh health care and in\n\n583\n\n00:22:57,640 -->

to\n\n586\n\n00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,520\n\nthe compliance requirements than even\n\n587\n\n00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,240\n\ncannabis so we we were we were prepared\n\n588\n\n00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,720\n\nfor it that has actually not been a\n\n589\n\n00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,360\n\nparticularly heavy lift for us I'll say\n\n590\n\n00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,679\n\nfor anybody who's getting into this\n\n591\n\n00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,919\n\nwithout a lot of external support I\n\n592\n\n00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,240\n\ndon't know where where folks are picking\n\n593\n\n00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,960\n\nthis up from or who's helping them you\n\n594\n\n00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,919\n\nknow I mean it it was it was a team\n\n595\n\n00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,840\n\neffort for us at Housing Works and we\n\n596\n\n00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,559\n\nhad a whole team so you know going back\n\n597\n\n00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,279\n\nto your question

prepare\n\n600\n\n00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,720\n\npeople for running these uh running\n\n601\n\n00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,080\n\nthese businesses yeah I concur um and\n\n602\n\n00:23:45,720 -->

not that regulated but if\n\n610\n\n00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:06,240\n\nlegalization were to happen or\n\n611\n\n00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,600\n\nrescheduling I don't know it could occur\n\n612\n\n00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,440\n\nbut until then we make a with the state\n\n613\n\n00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,039\n\nbyst state license for shames okay so\n\n614\n\n00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,240\n\njust a couple more questions while I\n\n615\n\n00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,200\n\nhave you as far as the state of the\n\n616\n\n00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,320\n\nCannabis industry in New York right\n\n617\n\n00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,720\n\nbecause now you've been in it for a\n\n618\n\n00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,600\n\nlittle bit is it bustling is it slow is\n\n619\n\n00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,440\n\nit still emerging what do you think so\n\n620\n\n00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,000\n\nglad you asked that question Hillary\n\n621\n\n00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,399\n\nbecause I'm not an economist\n\n622\n\n00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000\n\nbut the uh the folks at Whitney\n\n623\n\n00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,880\n\neconomics are and they released a report\n\n624\n\n00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,159\n\nearlier this year on the state of New\n\n625\n\n00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,799\n\nYork cannabis that that has been very\n\n626\n\n00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:42,279\n\neye openening um and I ju I just happen\n\n627\n\n00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:44,760\n\nto have a few of my favorite bullets on\n\n628\n\n00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,039\n\nthat one is that it's roughly a 1\n\n629\n\n00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,919\n\nbillion dollar industry right now and\n\n630\n\n00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,480\n\nthey think it could grow up to about six\n\n631\n\n00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,799\n\nbillion so only 15% of the way there a\n\n632\n\n00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,799\n\nlot of room for growth similarly New\n\n633\n\n00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,320\n\nYork is the fourth largest market in the\n\n634\n\n00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,000\n\nUS but we're fth in sales a lot of room\n\n635\n\n00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,000\n\nfor growth here's a good one going back\n\n636\n\n00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,640\n\nto licenses in October there have been\n\n637\n\n00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,720\n\nabout 800 licenses issued and that's\n\n638\n\n00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,080\n\nsocial equity and now also the beginning\n\n639\n\n00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,520\n\ntrickle of kind of mainstream\n\n640\n\n00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,399\n\nlicenses um but there's only about 200\n\n641\n\n00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,679\n\ndispensaries open and the assumption is\n\n642\n\n00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:24,799\n\nthat New York can handle about 1,300\n\n643\n\n00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,960\n\nlegal dispensaries as much as600 if\n\n644\n\n00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,799\n\nthere were no illegal sales whatsoever\n\n645\n\n00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:34,159\n\nand that probably won't happen so again\n\n646\n\n00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,559\n\nlots of room for growth in 2023 just a\n\n647\n\n00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,919\n\nlittle under 5% of all cannabis sales\n\n648\n\n00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,480\n\nwere legal this year we're at about 15%\n\n649\n\n00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,840\n\nof all cannabis sales are legal all\n\n650\n\n00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,799\n\nright well we still have 85% of illegal\n\n651\n\n00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,520\n\nsales a lot of room for growth so yeah\n\n652\n\n00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:52,720\n\nroom for growth is by far the the big\n\n653\n\n00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,919\n\ntheme here it's it's already getting\n\n654\n\n00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,960\n\nkind of competitive in New York City um\n\n655\n\n00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,240\n\nsome of that has to do with things like\n\n656\n\n00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,840\n\nthe one th000 foot rule dispensaries\n\n657\n\n00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,559\n\ncannot be less than 1,000 fet of each\n\n658\n\n00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,919\n\nother which is a good thing to be clear\n\n659\n\n00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,960\n\na very good thing but it does make it\n\n660\n\n00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,200\n\nhard to find real estate that is going\n\n661\n\n00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,399\n\nto be you know in those Pockets because\n\n662\n\n00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,799\n\nReal Estate in Manhattan and Brooklyn is\n\n663\n\n00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:20,679\n\njust Bonkers but in other parts of the\n\n664\n\n00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,720\n\nstate um Upstate the Southern Tier\n\n665\n\n00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,080\n\nWestern New York it they seem to be\n\n666\n\n00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,320\n\nopening up pretty well and you know kind\n\n667\n\n00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,080\n\nof getting some good Geographic spread\n\n668\n\n00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,000\n\nso a lot of room for growth the one\n\n669\n\n00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,480\n\nthing that was alarming in this report\n\n670\n\n00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,679\n\nmaybe it's not a big shocker but they\n\n671\n\n00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,440\n\nestimated how much money how much\n\n672\n\n00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,520\n\nrevenue a business needs to do to be\n\n673\n\n00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,279\n\nviable and it's you know in rural areas\n\n674\n\n00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,919\n\nit's the equivalent of about 215 Grand a\n\n675\n\n00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,840\n\nmonth in a high density urban area\n\n676\n\n00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,399\n\n$633,000 a month in Revenue which that's\n\n677\n\n00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,279\n\na steep hill to climb you know Housing\n\n678\n\n00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:01,799\n\nWorks was fortunate that we had both\n\n679\n\n00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:04,360\n\nboth first mover advantage and you know\n\n680\n\n00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:07,200\n\nthe the brand recognition of 35y old\n\n681\n\n00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,320\n\nBrands but um that's you know I guess\n\n682\n\n00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,480\n\nyou could call us New York famous if not\n\n683\n\n00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,000\n\nNational famous but folks who are\n\n684\n\n00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,919\n\nbuilding their brands from scratch they\n\n685\n\n00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,919\n\nthey've got a steep hill to climb and I\n\n686\n\n00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,200\n\nI'll say that our partners um the good\n\n687\n\n00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,640\n\nnews for them is that they are every\n\n688\n\n00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,600\n\nmonth they're doing better than the\n\n689\n\n00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,840\n\nmonth before so I think the starting\n\n690\n\n00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,520\n\npoint was lower than we hoped for for\n\n691\n\n00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,039\n\nall those delays and and failures of the\n\n692\n\n00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,320\n\nsocial Equity program that I mentioned\n\n693\n\n00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,559\n\nbut once they got there you know they\n\n694\n\n00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,679\n\nthey are improving month over month so\n\n695\n\n00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,240\n\nthey're getting there but New York's\n\n696\n\n00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,000\n\ntough yeah New York's hard these densely\n\n697\n\n00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,200\n\npopulated urban areas are quite\n\n698\n\n00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,039\n\ndifficult especially with the illegal\n\n699\n\n00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,600\n\nMarket it's a very tough competitor that\n\n700\n\n00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,600\n\ndoesn't pay taxes that isn't accountable\n\n701\n\n00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,159\n\nregulatory violations just going to take\n\n702\n\n00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,279\n\ntime is my opinion okay last question\n\n703\n\n00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,880\n\nand you don't have to reveal it you\n\n704\n\n00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,640\n\ncould just say yes or no expound if you\n\n705\n\n00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,679\n\nwant any plans for Housing Works to take\n\n706\n\n00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,240\n\nits show on the road nationally\n\n707\n\n00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,720\n\nregarding the Cannabis side of the house\n\n708\n\n00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,640\n\noh man I think we'd like to you know\n\n709\n\n00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,279\n\nlike I just said we're New York famous\n\n710\n\n00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,919\n\nthat doesn't mean we have to stick to\n\n711\n\n00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:16,519\n\nNew York only but I think the next plan\n\n712\n\n00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,480\n\nin our Partnerships is BR licensing\n\n713\n\n00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,240\n\nbecause of that experience that I just\n\n714\n\n00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,840\n\nmentioned where our partners who are\n\n715\n\n00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,960\n\nbuilding a brand from scratch have\n\n716\n\n00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,399\n\nreally had to bite tooth and Claw just\n\n717\n\n00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,760\n\nto hit viability that got us thinking\n\n718\n\n00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:32,679\n\nabout the idea a of Licensing the\n\n719\n\n00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,440\n\nHousing Works cannabis C- brand so that\n\n720\n\n00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:39,120\n\nPartners right out the gate on day one\n\n721\n\n00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,440\n\ncould look and feel at just like Housing\n\n722\n\n00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,480\n\nWorks cannabis Co e called Housing Works\n\n723\n\n00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,600\n\ncannabis Co so on and so forth and so we\n\n724\n\n00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,640\n\nstarted exploring that possibility we\n\n725\n\n00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,960\n\nhave a brand licensing agreement that's\n\n726\n\n00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,320\n\ncompliant with the New York regulations\n\n727\n\n00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,080\n\nand we've been exploring those\n\n728\n\n00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,440\n\nPartnerships because that to us is a\n\n729\n\n00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,600\n\nstrategy for success and the brand is\n\n730\n\n00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,279\n\nstrong you know you've had the Good\n\n731\n\n00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,760\n\nFortune of becoming one of the city and\n\n732\n\n00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,600\n\nthe state's most recognizable\n\n733\n\n00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,600\n\ndispensaries I think people like that\n\n734\n\n00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,960\n\nthere's a charitable Mission behind it\n\n735\n\n00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,799\n\ncould we go to Illinois could we go to\n\n736\n\n00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,120\n\nanother state in the Northeast maybe but\n\n737\n\n00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:17,159\n\nI think we have to see what's going to\n\n738\n\n00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,640\n\nhappen with this New York Market first\n\n739\n\n00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,360\n\nprice compression is real we we saw that\n\n740\n\n00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,600\n\nhappen you know in the first year I\n\n741\n\n00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,039\n\nthink we have to see how this all\n\n742\n\n00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,360\n\nstabilizes before we are ready to go\n\n743\n\n00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,200\n\nlearn a whole other State set of rules\n\n744\n\n00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,600\n\nand regulations that look nothing like\n\n745\n\n00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,480\n\nNew York's but nothing's off the table\n\n746\n\n00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,440\n\nbecause Housing Works is a little\n\n747\n\n00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,919\n\noffbeat like that we'll we'll

The same study also found that significantly more companies fell in the Trust & Like Score (TLS) ranking, compared to years past, when reputation scores have risen or remained neutral.\n\nAmazon, Costco, and UPS topped the list with a TLS of 78\u2014two points lower than last year for Amazon and one point higher for both Costco and UPS. Costco and UPS are two of only five companies on the list this year to improve their TLS. Freight and package delivery company FedEx followed at a score of 77 and home improvement and hardware store chains Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot tied for third at 76 points.\n\n\u201cAmazon maintains its strong reputation and position at the top of the list, which likely reflects its consistent presence in most Americans\u2019 lives and its continued drive to innovate,\u201d said Caliber CEO Shahar Silbershatz. \u201cThe fact that Amazon has maintained this lead even with a two-point drop in its Trust & Like Score is an impressive sign of the reputational capital it has banked, given the reputational hurdles like employee strikes that it faced in 2024. The company\u2019s investments in and partnership with OpenAI rival Anthropic likely also contributed to its position at the top of the list and the 44.4% increase in its share price, keeping it competitive for its key stakeholders.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s this year\u2019s top 10:\n\nAmazon Costco UPS FedEx Lowe\u2019s The Home Depot Kroger CVS Health Target Walmart\n\nA string of household names filled out the top 10 this year, including retailers Kroger, Lowe\u2019s, CVS, and Target. Other notable rankings include Apple (12th place with a TLS of 70, down four points from 2023), Meta (29th place with a TLS of 54, down four), and Tesla (30th place with a TLS of 53, down nine). This cemented Tesla\u2019s status as the biggest faller of the year, its TLS having fallen further than any other company by a margin of at least five.\n\nCaliber\u2019s annual Trust & Like Score ranking is based on a daily tracking study that measures public perceptions of the 30 largest and most visible Fortune 500 companies, selected based on their annual revenue and familiarity among the general public.

(Provided by UPS)\n\nUPS brought more than 100 Atlanta-based businesses and nonprofit organizations together on Jan. 15 for a discussion on how to collaborate to fight human trafficking.\n\nEvent speakers include executives from Delta Airlines, IHG, and AmeriGroup Georgia. Attendees include representatives from the Mayor\u2019s Office of Violence Reduction, the Department of Family & Children Services, the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office and local nonprofits.\n\nA panel led by Nikki Clifton, UPS President of Social Impact and The UPS Foundation brought representatives from three nonprofits into the discussion: Vanessa Wilkins, Executive Director of the Atlanta office for the Tahirih Justice Center; Christian Murphy, CEO of Wellspring Living, and; Jennifer Swain, executive director of youthSpark.\n\n\u201cThere are over 1,000 cases of human trafficking cases represented and reported in Atlanta every year in metro Atlanta,\u201d Wilkins said.\n\nThe Tahirih Justice Center provides legal services and social services case management to those they believe have a legitimate claim to legal status in the United States under immigration law as survivors of human trafficking and other forms of gender-based violence, she said.\n\n\u201cOnline exploitation is on the rise. Traffickers are using the internet as well as social media pages to really exploit children, to not only to recruit them, but to also sell them to the highest bidder, unfortunately,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nWellspring Living\u2019s website says it provides domestic sex trafficking victims and those at risk (ages 12+) with comprehensive, trauma-informed, victim-centered recovery services through residential programs, community-based programs, and post-program support.\n\nThe third organization represented was youthSpark, which Jennifer Swain, its executive director, said is a nonprofit based inside the Fulton County Juvenile Court. It identifies gaps in the trafficking response and creates solutions to those problems.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at youth who are in the system who have instances of unaddressed Child Sexual Abuse and Child sexual assault, education disconnection, and those young people who have frequent running away behaviors that indicate that there are some additional questions that need to be asked,\u201d she said.\n\nOne misconception Wilkins said exists is that human trafficking is sex trafficking. What\u2019s forgotten is labor trafficking is also coercion by forcing someone to work for no pay or little pay. Lack of immigration status is a key on ramp to human trafficking.\n\nUPS has a policy that prohibits human trafficking within its employee base that also flows down to its supply chain. Clifton told Rough Draft Atlanta that the global logistics provider has a keen understanding of the places, networks, and systems commonly used in the spread of human trafficking.\n\n\u201cOur approach to combatting human trafficking is comprehensive\u2014we use our financial resources, vast network, local partnerships and global workforce to deliver hope, awareness and change,\u201d Clifton said.\n\nMany UPS workers find the issue resonates with them. She said drivers feel that way as traffickers often sell and transport victims by using the same routes as UPS drivers travel. The logistics provider mobilizes its workforce by training employees to be an extra set of eyes and ears for law enforcement where they live, work and travel.\n\nClifton said more than12,000 newly hired UPS rivers completed human trafficking training. Almost all said they intend to use what they learned and now understand the process to report the crime. Approximately 210,000 UPS drivers and management employees have signed up for and received training on how to recognize and report human trafficking.\n\nEmployees have raised more than $10 million to combat human trafficking through employee giving campaigns. They\u2019ve also volunteered for local anti-trafficking organizations like WellSpring Living.\n\nUPS encouraged its audience during panel discussions and the wider Atlanta community to join the fight by taking action, whether they take anti-human trafficking training, donate, volunteer or have important conversations with their loved ones.\n\n\u201cThis is especially urgent as our city prepares to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will bring thousands of visitors to Atlanta, some for the sole purpose of engaging in human trafficking,\u201d Clifton said.",

That said, I think there's one key metric that investors should watch very closely when UPS releases its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 30.\n\nThe relationship between revenue per piece and cost per piece\n\nZeroing in on UPS' core U.S. domestic package segment, investors already know that delivery volumes are improving again, with a 6.5% increase in average daily volume on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. However, a lot of the volume increase comes from relatively lower revenue per-piece deliveries, which management describes as \"short zone, lightweight e-commerce packages\" flowing into its network.\n\nAs such, the transportation company needs to improve the relationship between revenue per piece, or RPP (up is good), and cost per piece, or CPP (down is good). As you can see below, RPP declined in the third quarter, but CPP was down more, leading to a positive spread.\n\nDigging into the fourth-quarter commentary on the last earnings call, management said CPP would increase in the fourth quarter, but the spread would remain positive, implying that RPP would also increase.\n\nUPS U.S. Domestic Package Segment First Quarter 2024 Second Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2024 Fourth Quarter 2024 Guidance\n\nRevenue per piece (0.3)% (2.6)% (2.2)% \"We expect the combination of both volume and revenue per piece growth\"* Adjusted cost per piece 4.1% 2.5% (4.1)% \"probably be up about 1% per piece\"* Spread (440) bp (510) bp 190 bp \"we'll maintain a positive spread\"*\n\nWhat it means to investors\n\nWith delivery volumes set to improve, UPS can demonstrate an ability to expand margins by improving the RPP/CPP spread. That's a key part of the bullish case for the stock, and investors should monitor this relationship closely.",

At the end of the day, there's a lot of capabilities that we think are going to be driving that. Commercial success (operational and financial) and tax are driving a lot of the trends we're seeing. There's also some bigger groundwork underway for the healthcare and life sciences industry around global innovation, fueled by the future of AI.\n\nClearly there's an impact right now on the financial markets due to inflation lowering. That's going to drive deal activity a bit more this year, although people are maybe a little bit more cautious of what happens in the out years. At the end of the day there's a generally optimistic environment for the biopharma market. As we start to see capital market improvements, biotechs are clearly going to be back on the radar for this year, and we believe that will continue beyond this year. A lot of the portfolios that are sitting in private equity, with venture capitalists, as well as in corporates are also undergoing quite a bit of review. That's also going to drive a variety of deal activity. There's a lot of fundamentals, whether it's economics, some of it is just timing in the market trajectory. It's hard to even have this discussion, of course, without the political impact, but clearly that's also starting to get factored in as well. All in all, it's driving a pretty good level of activity.\n\nPE: Do you think that the industry was waiting to see the results of the election before committing to a strategy for the coming year?\n\nShehata: There may have been a little of that, but I think a lot of the issues we've seen across the industry have generally been bipartisan. That\u2019s true whether we talk about things like the IRA, transparency in pricing, negotiating contracts, and all of those things. Some of the pressures that we're seeing on the payment side, through the payers, the discourse around PBMs, all of those things have generally had somewhat of a bipartisan support going into the election year.\n\nWhen those unknowns became knowns, as we got closer to election day, and clearly now, the industry showed a willingness to go forward. You have a combination of the financial markets easing and the election getting past us now, that's making for a pretty good and enticing deal market right now. That might go at least until the midterms, when we might see yet another turn of the election results. But I think that is creating a little bit of pressure right now to try to get some of these deal deals done, as long as the financial environment remains positive.\n\nPE: What are the other factors that you think are most likely to impact deal activity?\n\nShehata: The big issue we start to see looking down the road is whether the true impact of technology and AI is going to start to take hold. We think that will take have a significant role in driving development around healthcare and life sciences deals and even acquiring innovative technologies. But at the end of the day, some of those impacts, at least in the pharmaceutical life sciences industry, will likely be delayed in 2025.\n\nIt's optimistic, but I think a lot of the novel and innovative therapies may not get the full benefit for some of the AI discovery programs.",

            "content": "A fitness influencer with an unbreakable spirit smashed a pull-ups record after training day-in-day-out.\n\nXie Ting (China) claimed the record for most pull-ups in one minute (female) with an impressive 44.\n\nXie Ting, 22, was born in Jiangxi, and later moved to Guangdong. By day, she's a social media content creator sharing her fitness journey and lifestyle. With over 400,000 followers, she's become a beloved figure, known for her authenticity and determination.\n\nAt first, Xie Ting never planned to break a Guinness World Records title. She was simply documenting her fitness journey, sharing the ups and downs with her audience. But as she continued her training and saw progress, she realized she might just be capable of aiming higher. That's when the thought of going for the world record crept into her mind.\n\nHer target was 39 pull-ups in one minute, a record set by American athlete Inga Simning in 2022. At the time, Xie Ting hadn't specifically trained for pull-ups; her strength came from her regular fitness routine. She knew it would be a challenge, but also the perfect opportunity to show off the results of her consistent training.\n\nAfter officially applying for the record, Xie Ting revamped her training regimen. She upped the frequency of her pull-up workouts and began fine-tuning her technique, making sure every rep was flawless.\n\nThe attempt was set on a winter day in Beijing. The cold was brutal, and warming up felt like an uphill battle. The outdoor barbell might as well have been an ice block.\n\nBut with months of training under her belt, Xie Ting wasn't about to let a little thing like discomfort hold her back.\n\nOnce everything was set, she focused, adjusted her breathing, and dove into the challenge. Her movements were quick and precise, and you could see the concentration on her face every time she pulled herself up, as if each rep was a personal victory against her own limits.\n\nIn the end, she completed 44 perfect pull-ups in one minute, breaking the record.\n\n\u201cI've never thought there's any difference between men and women in sports. Strength doesn't depend on gender,\u201d Xie Ting said firmly. She doesn't care much about gender differences; what matters to her is the attitude one brings to a challenge.\n\nFor Xie Ting, gender doesn't limit athletic performance or achievements, but it can serve as a powerful motivator. She doesn't see herself as a \u201cfemale athlete\u201d; rather, she views each challenge as an opportunity for self-improvement.\n\nDespite her outstanding record, Xie Ting isn't fully satisfied. \u201cEven though I broke the record, I feel there's still room for improvement. Next time, I'll go for an even higher score,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to her new Guinness World Records certificate, Xie Ting has recently earned her fitness coach certification, ready to delve even deeper into the fitness world.\n\nHer next goal? To continue smashing her own records and perhaps even go for the title of the most pull-ups in one hour.\n\nAs she said, \u201cExercise is not just about improving physical fitness; it's about strengthening our inner selves.\u201d\n\nThrough her actions, Xie Ting is showing the true meaning of female strength, and her story will undoubtedly continue to inspire more women to boldly challenge themselves, break their own limits, and reach for an even brighter future.",

            "content": "In the latest trading session, United Parcel Service (UPS) closed at $132.55, marking a -0.24% move from the previous day. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.61% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.28%.\n\nShares of the package delivery service have appreciated by 5.24% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Transportation sector's gain of 4.09% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of United Parcel Service in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. In that report, analysts expect United Parcel Service to post earnings of $2.52 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 2.02%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $25.34 billion, indicating a 1.7% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.16% higher. Currently, United Parcel Service is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that United Parcel Service has a Forward P/E ratio of 15.2 right now. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.99 for its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, UPS's PEG ratio is currently 1.87. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.23 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry is part of the Transportation sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 221, this industry ranks in the bottom 12% of all industries, numbering over 250.",

            "content": "On January 22, 2025, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published its annual update to the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act thresholds in the Federal Register. The HSR Act governs certain deals that must be reported to the FTC and the US Department of Justice prior to being consummated.1\n\nPursuant to the new thresholds, a transaction must be reported if:\n\nThe transaction value is greater than $505.8 million (previously, $478 million); or\n\nIf (a) the transaction value is greater than $126.4 million (previously, $119.5 million); (b) one party has net sales or total assets of $25.3 million or more (previously, $23.9 million); and (c) a second party has net sales or total assets of $252.9 million or more (previously, $239 million).\n\nThe revised thresholds will apply to transactions consummated on or after February 21, 2025, which is 30 days from the date on which the revised thresholds were published in the Federal Register.\n\nHSR Act thresholds are tied to the US gross national product. The 2025 HSR reporting thresholds represent an increase of approximately 5.8% over the 2024 thresholds.\n\nThe number of HSR filings for the calendar year 2024 was 2,158, an increase of 17.7% over the number of filings in 2023 (1,833).\n\nThe updated HSR filing fee structure and fee thresholds, which take effect on the same day as the revised thresholds described above, were required under Division GG of the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act.2 As in years past, the updated fees are keyed to the value of the transaction and HSR Act thresholds, as follows:\n\n\n\nTransaction Value (2024) Filing Fee (2024) More than $126.4 million but less than $179.4 million (previously, more than $119.5 million, but less than $173.3 million) $30,000 (unchanged) $179.4 million or more, but less than $555.5 million (previously, $173.3 million or more, but less than $536.5 million) $105,000 (unchanged) $555.5 million or more, but less than $1.111 billion (previously, $536.5 million or more, but less than $1.073 billion) $265,000 (previously, $260,000) $1.111 billion or more, but less than $2.222 billion (previously, $1.073 billion or more, but less than $2.146 billion) $425,000 (previously, $415,000) $2.222 billion or more, but less than $5.555 billion (previously, $2.146 billion or more, but less than $5.365 billion) $850,000 (previously, $830,000) $5.555 billion or more (previously, $5.365 billion or more) $2.390 million (previously, $2.335 million)\n\nThe FTC also has announced new thresholds for certain HSR exemptions and thresholds for Interlocking Directorates under Section 8 of the Clayton Act. The Section 8 thresholds took effect immediately upon their publication in the Federal Register on January 22, 2025. Similarly, for penalties for violations of the HSR Act, the maximum penalty was increased to $53,088 per day (published in the Federal Register and effective on January 17, 2025).3\n\nTo help navigate the complex HSR Act rules, Mayer Brown has created an interactive presentation that provides quick and practical HSR guidance. Drawing from the 2025 FTC thresholds, this presentation allows you to choose the criteria that best apply to your organization or transaction, then walks you through a basic analysis of whether an HSR Act filing is necessary.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s Federal Register notice and a complete list of all HSR threshold adjustments can be found on the FTC\u2019s website.\n\n1 Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.\n\n2 Public Law 117-328, 136 Stat. 4459.\n\n3 Federal Register :: Adjustments to Civil Penalty Amounts.",

Now, the town\u2019s leaders are focusing attention on the private rental market, aiming to coax property owners to either become year-round landlords or continue renting to year-round tenants.\n\nThat shift is important, because with real estate prices soaring ever upward, secure housing is still out of reach for most people who work here, according to an analysis of Cape Cod Commission data.\n\nThe main avenue for the effort so far has been Lease to Locals, a program the select board discussed extending and expanding at its Jan. 13 meeting.\n\nLease to Locals offers one-time payments of $6,000 to $20,000 to landlords who sign new year-round leases for properties that had previously been used as vacation homes or short-term or seasonal rentals. To qualify, their new tenants must live or work on the Outer Cape, be disabled or retired, or contribute to the community by serving on town boards or actively participating in the arts.\n\nThat program, begun last April, has resulted in 49 tenants being housed at 28 properties. There are more leases set to begin in the next few months, according to Town Manager Alex Morse, and by the time the program\u2019s first year ends in April, $528,600 will have helped secure leases for 68 tenants at 39 properties.\n\nThe California-based company called Placemate that administers Lease to Locals pitched the subsidies as lasting only one year, telling town officials that about 80 percent of landlords wind up continuing their year-round rentals even when the subsidies end. Nonetheless, select board members and people who spoke at the meeting worried that ending the subsidies after one year would result in evictions.\n\nChase Hiffernan, a Lease to Locals tenant who opened a yoga studio on Commercial Street in 2023, told the select board that if the subsidies were to end this year, current landlords would have to either \u201cevict first-year tenants or massively increase our rent.\u201d\n\nHiffernan added, \u201cA lot of these leases started in May and June, so if we don\u2019t get renewed we\u2019re going to be displaced at the beginning of summer.\u201d\n\nHiffernan\u2019s landlord, Jill Rothenberg-Simmons, who owns a property that includes the On Center Gallery, also spoke.\n\n\u201cWe had wanted to rent year-round,\u201d Rothenberg-Simmons said, \u201cbut it costs a lot of money to own a building in Provincetown. The Lease to Locals program was a win-win for all of us.\n\n\u201cUntil we provide more affordable housing \u2014 and I know that\u2019s in the works, and that\u2019s great \u2014 we need to continue programs like this so that people like myself can afford to rent to the year-round workforce,\u201d Rothenberg-Simmons said.\n\nSelect board members agreed, with Leslie Sandberg, Erik Borg, and John Golden all saying that one more year of subsidies was worth it to keep people housed until the Province Post affordable housing complex opens at 3 Jerome Smith Road in 2026.\n\nThe select board also discussed whether to keep the program open for new leases after April 1. Placemate had forecast that it could book 53 more tenants into 30 properties.\n\nTo support new leases and continue subsidies for older ones would cost $857,550 in the program\u2019s second year, Morse told the select board. The money would come from the town\u2019s 6-percent tax on short-term rental and hotel bookings, which brought in $5.2 million in 2024.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big chunk of money,\u201d said Golden, \u201cbut to try to find another place in May is ridiculous. Let\u2019s extend this.\u201d\n\nLong-Term Landlords\n\nThe board also discussed how to help landlords who aren\u2019t eligible for the program because they have been renting year-round for years. Some long-term landlords have asked the select board why former short-term rental owners should get public funds while they cannot.\n\nPlacemate proposed a $100 to $200 per month subsidy for 20 landlords, which it said would cost $95,000, but select board members had other ideas for how to help keep long-term landlords in the rental market.\n\nBoard member Austin Miller said that offering forgivable grants for major investments, such as new appliances or roofs, in exchange for a commitment to rent year-round for another 10 years would be better than a monthly subsidy.\n\n\u201cPeople who have been doing year-round rentals do have costs, and things are getting more expensive,\u201d said Sandberg. \u201cLet\u2019s find out what their needs are. Maybe it\u2019s a grant program.\u201d\n\nAn RTE for Landlords\n\nGolden pointed out that both longtime landlords and the newer Lease to Locals landlords are eligible for the town\u2019s \u201cexpanded residential tax exemption\u201d for year-round rental properties.\n\nResidential tax exemptions are an option under state law that allows towns to discount the assessed value of the homes of residents when calculating property taxes. In Provincetown, the discount was worth about $2,000 last year, although the actual amount of net tax savings is lower for higher-value properties.\n\nAt town meeting in 2017, Provincetown\u2019s voters extended the tax break to properties that house year-round renters; Truro followed suit in 2019. Provincetown\u2019s voters expanded the tax break again at town meeting in 2023, voting to allow the owners of multi-unit properties to take up to four exemptions on one parcel. That expansion just went into effect when Gov. Maura Healey signed the town\u2019s home rule petition on Jan. 6.\n\nThe new rules mean that owners who live at their rental properties can now claim one exemption for their owner-occupied unit and up to three more for rental units on the same parcel, said Town Assessor Scott Fahle.\n\nOnly 22 properties received the exemption for year-round rentals last fiscal year, according to a list Fahle provided to the Independent. The town has more than 200 privately owned long-term rentals, according to rental certificate records, and now nearly all of them could be eligible for the tax break.\n\n\u201cWe need to get this out to homeowners,\u201d Sandberg said.\n\nState Sen. Julian Cyr told the Independent that the residential tax exemption for year-round rentals was not in the state\u2019s initial group of new tools for \u201cseasonal communities\u201d \u2014 a designation that includes all the towns on the Outer and Lower Cape \u2014 but that it could be added later. \u201cA year-round rental RTE seems like something that would fit well within that umbrella,\u201d Cyr said.\n\n\u201cProvincetown has pioneered a number of crucial policies,\u201d Cyr added. Towns on the Cape and Islands \u201cneed to figure out how to subsidize housing for almost all working people who don\u2019t own a home or stand to inherit one.\u201d",

The region was hit by a historic winter storm that brought snow, ice and freezing cold to the area.\n\nEven though natural melting will occur soon after in the wake of the historical storm that dumped record snowfall and even created blizzard conditions along the Interstate 10 corridor of the southeastern United States, difficulties and dangers will linger for days in the hardest-hit locations, AccuWeather meteorologists advise.\n\nCleanup crews, motorists and pedestrians in the Midwest and Northeast are used to dealing with the aftermath of frequent winter storms, but this is not so for Southerners and especially those along the Gulf coast. Storms like the one on Tuesday only come along from once in a few decades to once in 100 years or more.\n\nMilton, Florida, set a new state record with this storm as 9.8 inches of snow fell, breaking the old record of 4 inches set in 1954. From 2 to 4 inches of snow fell across the Houston area. A storm from February 1895 that predates airport data likely remains at the top of the list at some locations, including New Orleans. New Orleans picked up 8 inches of snow from the storm a few days ago. The overall top snowfall from the Tuesday storm appears to be in Grand Coteau, Louisiana, with 13.4 inches, which also set a state record.\n\nThe sun will go to work on the frigid air that swept in from thousands of miles away in northern Canada and Siberia ahead of and during the storm in the southern U.S. Some melting will occur and may quickly help to free some roads and sidewalks of ice and snow--where the accumulation has been relatively small.\n\nHowever, because many locations along the I-10 corridor received deep snow from the storm and proper snow removal equipment is in short supply or non-existent, it will take a few days for all of it to melt and for roads, sidewalks, and parking lots to dry completely.\n\nWith multiple nights of below-freezing temperatures in store, runoff and areas made wet and slushy by the natural melting during the day will freeze.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to rebound almost immediately after the storm over portions of central and southern Texas, but the warming trend will take progressively longer farther to the east along the Gulf coast.\n\nSurfaces that appear to be wet could be icy instead\n\nMelting and freezing cycles are common across the Northern states in the wake of major storms and easily dealt with by the spread of ice-melting compounds. However, these treatments are in short supply or non-existent in the Southern states.\n\nGET THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP\n\nOften a thin sheet of clear ice can form on wet surfaces around sunset or as late as daybreak. Extreme caution is urged as the ice may appear to be just a wet road, sidewalk or parking lot.\n\nSand, cat litter, or pea-sized gravel can make some surfaces less slippery and help reduce the risk of injury to passers-by. Local property owners and township crews can help remove snow from storm drains to reduce the amount of water collecting on the streets and intersections, which can freeze at night. Even in the Northern states, the number of slip-and-fall incidents balloons several days after a major storm due to refreezing episodes.\n\nThere has been considerable natural melting of the existing snow and ice cover around Houston on Wednesday and Thursday. But still, any wet patches leftover from the afternoon hours can freeze in the evening and overnight. The ice may appear to be wet and can be dangerous by foot or tire. As nighttime temperatures trend upward this weekend, this risk should diminish.\n\nFarther to the east, in cities such as New Orleans; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida, the thaw and freeze cycles and risk of icy surfaces during the nighttime and morning hours may last into the weekend due to a more gradual warmup.\n\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

            "content": "Introduction\n\nThe rapid advancement of technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum, space, and biotechnology is driving transformation in the commercial and defense sectors. Start-ups excel at commercializing new technologies, making their involvement crucial for accelerating defense technology development and deployment. While China advances its military-civil fusion policy, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is accelerating engagement with start-ups and overseas companies to promote defense technology innovation.\n\nCoincidentally, start-up ecosystems are emerging in Japan, a close U.S. ally, including in the defense sector. This opens new possibilities for U.S.-Japan defense collaboration and further strengthens the alliance. At the 35th U.S.-Japan Technology Forum in October 2024, an annual event that brings together leading U.S.-Japan defense-technology stakeholders, a record number of start-ups participated and many high-level speakers from DOD, the U.S. National Security Council, the Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency of Japan (ATLA) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) emphasized the importance of involving start-ups in bilateral defense cooperation. Both countries have advanced discussions about the potential for more defense industrial cooperation under the bilateral Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment (DICAS) Forum. Integrating start-ups into both nations\u2019 defense ecosystems should remain a priority going forward.\n\nDefense-Tech Start-ups and Alliance Cooperation\n\nUnderstanding that the technologies that may decide future wars are being developed predominantly among commercial companies, the DOD has launched initiatives to enhance the acquisition of such technologies both domestically and globally. The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) of the DOD updated its strategy last February and stated that it will expand its reach to the innovation ecosystems of U.S. allies and partners to source the best dual-use technology on a global scale. NATO also plans to introduce an accelerator program to foster collaboration with dual-use technology start-ups among its members.\n\nBipartisan concerns about declining competitiveness in the U.S. defense industrial base and national security risks in the supply chain will likely persist during the Trump administration. The Republican Party\u2019s 2024 policy platform advocates for modernizing the military by investing in cutting-edge research and advanced technologies, as well as strengthening alliances by ensuring fair-share investment from allies in our common defense. From the business perspective, the intensifying global security crisis has driven up defense-related stock prices and attracted stable venture capital (VC) investment in U.S. defense technology. Various investors and start-ups anticipate a surge in opportunities under the Trump administration due to expected deregulation and expanded more efficient government procurement processes. President Trump nominated Stephen Feinberg, a billionaire investor with deep ties to the defense industry, to be the deputy defense secretary, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist, to be the White House AI and Crypto Czar. If the United States aims to retain the world\u2019s most technologically advanced and well-equipped military, maintaining a positive stance on leveraging allied technologies is a logical and strategic approach.\n\nJapan\u2019s Budding Defense-Tech Start-ups\n\nWhile the United States accounts for 42 percent of global arms exports, Japan has recorded only one case of exporting finished defense equipment to date, due to a long-standing institutional prohibition on arms exports that was not revised until 2014. Consequently, Japan had not nurtured defense start-ups or collaborated with U.S. counterparts, unlike the United Kingdom or Australia.\n\nIn 2022, the Japanese government allocated a budget of JPY 1 trillion (approximately USD 7 billion) to build start-up ecosystems under its Startup Development Five-Year Plan and introduced various unprecedented measures. The promotion of start-up businesses with innovative and advanced science and technology, namely \u201cdeep-tech,\u201d is one of the pillars, and the current Ishiba Shigeru administration declared its support for research and development (R&D), innovation hubs, and human resource development for university-based, deep-tech start-ups. In fact, the number of university spin-off start-ups and the funding they attract are both on the rise.\n\nThese deep techs are expected to enhance Japan\u2019s defense capability. ATLA operates the Innovative Science and Technology Initiative for Security program for universities and start-ups to support deep-tech research that will contribute to future R&D in the defense sector. ATLA and METI also established the joint promotion committee in 2023 to create opportunities for matching the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF) and start-ups. As a result of these efforts, the start-ups and VCs interested in the defense sector are steadily increasing. Notable examples include Metro Weather, which utilizes cutting-edge technology to predict changes in wind conditions; Terra Labo, which offers observation and analysis services using unmanned aircraft; and Preferred Networks, which provides innovative solutions utilizing deep learning and robotics technologies. VCs with strengths in deep tech, such as the gap fund of the University of Tokyo and the Incubate Fund, also joined the committee.\n\nIn Japan, there is growing recognition that the defense sector is an important market for start-ups. Reflecting such trends, some start-ups, accelerators, VCs, and large companies are already preparing for these business opportunities and approximately 40 start-ups and other private companies from Japan participated in the series of the annual U.S.-Japan defense industry meetings, driven by the positive attitude of both countries\u2019 governments.\n\nIndustrial security, often cited as a challenge for Japanese companies participating in U.S. government procurement, has been gradually strengthened. ATLA formulated the Defense Industrial Security Manual, which consolidates industrial security rules, following the U.S. National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. Additionally, Japan became the first Asian country to join the Multinational Industrial Security Working Group, a collaborative body for international industrial security best practices. Last May, Japan\u2019s parliament enacted a bill to introduce a security clearance system for accessing classified information related to economic security, aligning the country with other Group of Seven nations. In short, the foundation for advancing U.S.-Japan defense technology cooperation is being established.\n\nPotential for U.S.-Japan Start-up Cooperation\n\nAs the importance of defense technology cooperation between the United States and Japan grows, start-ups have been a missing player. However, it is obvious that involving start-ups has the potential to accelerate the utilization of cutting-edge technologies and the creation of a more resilient defense industrial base. What steps are most likely to foster collaboration?\n\nOne promising area is U.S. government procurement. Japan ranks third globally both in R&D expenditure and patent applications, with emerging deep-tech start-up ecosystems, and further, there is a well-established trade control system between both countries. The United States can leverage technologies and prototypes funded and developed by allies through bilateral and multilateral programs, aligning with the Republican policy platform\u2019s goal of strengthening alliances by ensuring allies\u2019 investment in common defense.\n\nThe DOD has already implemented acquisition programs to actively adopt advanced and superior technologies from other countries. The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program helps U.S. military program offices procure defense articles from abroad by evaluating mature foreign technologies, and has experience of over 1,000 technological tests with about 40 countries. Among them, five projects are currently active with Japanese companies. As for relatively early-stage start-ups with prototypes, DIU opens the door for allies to apply for procurement through the International Prototype Awards and has already secured purchases from 10 countries.\n\nThere is another unique initiative funded by the Central Intelligence Agency: In-Q-Tel (IQT), a venture fund that supports start-ups from the very early stage and bridges their products to government procurement. It has invested in nearly 20 countries including Japan\u2019s first fusion energy start-up in 2024. Notably, both DIU and IQT dispatched representatives to Japan in 2024 to meet with start-up stakeholders and to seek the next deals.\n\nAnother area of potential is applied research in deep tech for commercialization. Last October, the Defense Innovation Science and Technology Institute (DISTI) was established within ATLA to harness various advancing technologies and create innovative functions and equipment that will transform future warfare. The institute is a reference to U.S. institutions such as the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and DIU and already launched several breakthrough research projects. DIU and DISTI will explore joint project opportunities through the prize challenge for defense-tech start-ups. Additionally, Japan\u2019s Global Startup Campus is set to launch in Tokyo, aiming to invite U.S. researchers and VCs and to foster deep-tech start-ups, supported by an initial research funding budget of JPY 57 billion. U.S.-Japan defense technology collaboration is gaining momentum through joint initiatives.\n\nFurthermore, start-ups from both countries will have opportunities to be integrated into each other\u2019s supply chains and collaborate with large companies on joint development projects. They may also participate in government initiatives, ranging from research to implementation, although establishing the necessary framework may take time.\n\nRecommended Efforts\n\nThere is great potential for U.S.-Japan start-up cooperation but also hurdles both in the public and the private sectors that must be cleared to make this potential a reality.\n\n1. Establishing Information-Sharing Channels and Strengthening Information Dissemination\n\nIn addition to ongoing agreements between both nations\u2019 leaders to foster defense-tech cooperation, field-level channels are crucial to deepen mutual understanding of prioritized technologies and procurement processes. Involving start-ups in the existing U.S.-Japan defense dialogue is an effective way to create a multi-layered and broader base of participants. Establishing a dedicated function within the Japanese government to share U.S. procurement information with industries and help them accumulate business experience in the U.S. market would be highly beneficial. ATLA and METI should enhance the joint promotion committee to serve this purpose. Awareness of U.S. initiatives like FCT, DIU, and IQT remains low in Japan, highlighting the need for the United States to better disseminate information and introduce clear and attractive procedures for start-ups. At the same time, Japanese start-ups must also proactively share information about their technologies and applications by participating in defense-tech exhibitions and stakeholder forums. Major Japanese companies with extensive experience in the U.S. market can serve as a vital bridge among the stakeholders.\n\n2. Aligning Information Security\n\nIt is crucial for Japan to uphold an information protection system equivalent to those of its allies and partners by establishing the nation\u2019s defense framework against cyberattacks, known as active cyber defense, and addressing the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification 2.0, released by the DOD last October. ATLA should continue to assist start-ups to meet these security criteria by providing guidance and financial support. Strengthening Japan\u2019s information security posture will enable both countries to update export control policies which hinder smooth joint R&D and technology transfers, especially in dual-use technologies.\n\n3. Overcoming Defense Industry\u2013Specific Challenges in Japan\n\nJapanese start-ups and VCs must overcome the academic or financial mindset that discourages involvement in military-related matters, as some VC-limited partner agreements or research awards prohibit weapon-related business. Strengthening dialogues between ATLA and start-ups and VCs will contribute to cultivating human resources with a solid understanding of the defense sector, reducing aversion to defense activities, and gaining a better understanding of the private sector\u2019s dynamics. ATLA retirees and JSDF veterans in the private sector could bridge such dialogues with support from the Japan Association of Defense Industry and the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies.\n\n4. Strengthening Japan\u2019s Deep-Tech Ecosystem Itself\n\nJapan\u2019s deep-tech start-up ecosystem remains underdeveloped, with limited pathways to commercialize research projects through start-ups and only two deep-tech unicorns compared to 979 in the United States. Forming start-up support teams within universities and attracting deep-tech-focused overseas VCs are essential steps. For the Japanese government, it is essential to expand and utilize the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) scheme including the Innovative Science and Technology Initiative for Security Program, and accelerator programs such as the J-StarX Dual Use Technology Accelerator. Additionally, these programs should offer participants greater opportunities to connect with the U.S. market or stakeholders.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rise of commercially driven technologies through start-ups, Japan\u2019s efforts to build robust deep-tech start-up ecosystems, and the shifting perception of defense as a viable business all create an opportune momentum for U.S.-Japan collaboration in the defense and dual-use sectors. Integrating start-ups into traditional industries can diversify the defense industrial base, speed up innovation, and strengthen supply chain resilience. To seize this unique opportunity, continued efforts from both countries are essential. Commitment from President Trump and Prime Minister Ishiba at the upcoming summit will further encourage start-ups and accelerate technology cooperation.\n\nMakoto Tsujiguchi is a visiting fellow with the Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., from the Japan Business Federation.

Referred to as a \u201cdiscovery service,\u201d Primo replaces Trible Library\u2019s old online catalog.\n\n\u201cStudents now have a powerful tool to assist them with their search and research needs,\u201d said Johnnie Gray, digital services librarian. \u201cOur hope is that this product will bring our library services into the future.\u201d\n\nUsing Primo is easy. Once you sign in using your Christopher Newport credentials on the library\u2019s homepage, a whole world of research capabilities will instantly become available. Primo, used by many universities nationwide, gives instant access to all library materials on one interface: books, ebooks, full-text articles, streaming media, and access to items not on campus through an interlibrary loan.\n\n\u201cPrimo simplifies the research process by presenting an all-in-one interface for accessing physical and digital material. Primo saves time by using this one interface to connect books and journals in a seamless integration of content that you can access on your computer from anywhere,\u201d Gray said.\n\nPrimo not only amplifies the ability to do thorough research, it also allows users to receive email alerts when new content they\u2019ve searched for becomes available. In addition, the system can provide citing assistance.\n\nChristopher Newport currently has access to more than 350 databases. And while Primo doesn\u2019t replace them, it operates in concert with them.\n\n\u201cPrimo works with nearly all of our databases, so it enhances findability for the vast content we are able to have,\u201d Gray said.\n\nBefore it was officially launched, the library tested it with select faculty and students. Gray said feedback, \u201cwas extremely positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cEase of use and excellent search results were all mentioned,\u201d he added.\n\nIf students need additional help, they are encouraged to seek the guidance of librarians.\n\n\u201cThe new system is nice, but if you combine it with the Trible Library reference librarians, students will be well prepared for tackling any paper or presentation,\u201d Gray said.",

But it\u2019s also likely to be more expensive.\n\nThe UPS service known as SurePost was primarily something businesses used as an economic way to send less urgent packages, like a shirt or a pair of shoes from a retailer. Under the arrangement, USPS would deliver the last mile of those UPS packages.\n\nNow that the SurePost contract has expired and the USPS is not interested in renewing it, UPS says it will handle delivery of these rural packages door to door \u2014 except deliveries to post office boxes and military APO/FPO/DPO addresses.\n\nThose will no longer be able to get a UPS package direct as they had under SurePost. And this is where just a little bit of confusion has come into play, according to a postal worker in a small northwest Wyoming town who spoke with Cowboy State Daily on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cAmazon packages are being returned by the armloads for my P.O. box customers,\u201d the worker said about the recently expired SurePost deal. \u201cNeither UPS nor USPS is talking about it, but it\u2019s affecting customers nationwide.\u201d\n\nMany Small Wyoming Towns Only Have P.O. Boxes\n\nCowboy State Daily sent an inquiry to the USPS about SurePost ending, but there was no response at the time of this story posting.\n\nIn national news media, USPS spokesmen said the old agreement with UPS failed to reflect actual operational and financial considerations, as well as ways in which the USPS is changing its services.\n\nOne reason the SurePost change could have far-reaching impact in Wyoming is that so many of its towns are rural, Bob Jacknitsky, Wyoming state representative for the National Postal Mail Handlers Union Local 321, told Cowboy State Daily.\n\n\u201cI would say that this is beneficial for the USPS in the long run,\u201d he said. \u201cI would also say that this is beneficial for the UPS employees.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I would say this is bad news for the rural communities, per usual. Since only USPS mailing can go into mailboxes, people will no longer be able to receive their UPS packages that way.\u201d\n\nMany of Wyoming\u2019s towns are so small all they have are P.O. boxes, Jacknitsky added. In the short-run, that could mean lots of small Wyoming towns with packages being returned by the armload while all the SurePost deliveries work their way through the system.\n\n\u201cI read that the Teamsters are rejoicing on the additional packages and are already saying UPS needs to hire more workers,\u201d Jacknitsky said. \u201cWith UPS being a for-profit company, all additional cost will be passed onto the customers.\n\n\u201cThe USPS will most likely benefit from more people wanting to have their packages delivered to their mail receptacles.\u201d\n\nJacknitsky predicted that USPS Ground Advantage will likely be the cheapest option for people who want mail delivered to their P.O. boxes rather than their homes.\n\nIn the case of military addresses like APO/DPO/FPO boxes, that may be the only option going forward.\n\nPeople line up to be helped at the Cheyenne Post Office, where they also can access P.O. boxes. (Greg Johnson, Cowboy State Daily)\n\nWhy Packages Will Be Faster\n\nJacknitsky was referencing Facebook posts by the Teamsters Union that have called on UPS to add staff, in part to curb \u201cexcessive\u201d overtime, as 3 million-some packages will be remaining on UPS trucks.\n\nBut what Cary Lambert, who delivers packages in the Happy Valley area for UPS, believes will happen in practice is just fewer layoffs. Because of that, he doesn\u2019t expect costs to rise much at all.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, what happens is we have eight drivers who are not assigned who do not have routes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo right after Christmas, two to three of those people after the Christmas rush slows down, those people are laid off.\u201d\n\nLambert thinks those people will instead keep working their shifts for longer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be keeping everyone busy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come in the next week or two, after things start slowing down a little bit, but if people are laid off it\u2019s going to be maybe one or two, versus like four or five, after Christmas.\u201d\n\nLambert also thinks package deliveries will get faster for rural areas than they have been in the long run. In the past, what he\u2019s seen happen is that there\u2019s a lag time while USPS processes the SurePost packages it receives for last-mile delivery.\n\n\u201cThe customer kind of doesn\u2019t understand that,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cThey think it\u2019s going to be delivered that day when it goes to USPS, but (the mail carriers) have to receive them. They\u2019ve got to check them in. It could be two to three business days later.\u201d\n\nAnd, if a package turns out to be too large for a rural route box, the customer gets a slip to come to the post office for their package instead, adding yet another day to the delivery time.\n\n\u201cSo not only are you three days late getting that little slip, but you have to go get it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo altogether that could be anywhere between a four- to an eight-day business day delay.\u201d\n\nBy skipping the middleman, UPS packages will get to their locations faster, Lambert said, at what he believes will be close to the same rates.\n\nRen\u00e9e Jean can be reached at renee@cowboystatedaily.com.",

Regular consumers don\u2019t send something via SurePost, but rather, it\u2019s a contract service UPS has primarily with larger businesses and retailers. The U.S. Postal Service is the only entity that can deliver directly to a P.O. box, including APO/FPO/DPO addresses, so SurePost will no longer be available for those deliveries.\n\n\n\nSurePost, a UPS service primarily used by businesses to send packages, is changing after a contract with the U.S. Postal Service expired.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the changes for businesses who send packages, and consumers who receive them:\n\nWhat is UPS SurePost?\n\nThe backstory:\n\nUPS SurePost is an economy service for less urgent packages that's offered to business shippers \u2013 such as when clothing is ordered online for home delivery. Regular consumers don\u2019t send something via SurePost, but rather, it\u2019s a contract service UPS has primarily with larger businesses and retailers.\n\nPreviously, many SurePost packages were dropped off by UPS to U.S. Postal Service facilities near the final destination, and USPS would ultimately deliver the package.\n\nAfter the contract ended with USPS, UPS now handles all SurePost packages door-to-door.\n\nWill this change how I get my package?\n\nWhat we know:\n\nFor the majority of recipients, no. UPS SurePost delivers to residential physical addresses in the contiguous 48 U.S. states. The U.S. Postal Service is the only entity that can deliver directly to a P.O. box, including APO/FPO/DPO addresses, so SurePost will no longer be available for those deliveries.\n\nHowever, other UPS delivery services, such as Ground, Second Day Air and Next Day Air, will continue to be available for people in U.S. territories, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nFor businesses that use UPS SurePost, UPS is working on updating its systems to remove P.O. boxes as an option when shipping via SurePost.\n\nConsumers can redirect SurePost packages in transit that are expected to be delivered to a P.O. box to a street address by signing up for UPS MyChoice . With the service, consumers can also direct packages to any UPS Store location as well as UPS Access Point partners like CVS, Michaels, and other local businesses.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"For consumer and business customers alike, all SurePost deliveries are now made directly by their regular UPS driver,\" a UPS spokesperson told FOX Television Stations. \"There is no impact or change to UPS\u2019s primary delivery services, including UPS Ground, UPS Second Day Air and UPS Next Day Air.\"\n\nFor its part, USPS said in a statement that it has been \"implementing a new strategic approach with respect to its contracts with package consolidator companies\" throughout the past year.\n\n\"Prior agreements failed to reflect operational and financial realities, the evolving postal network, or the enhancements to our portfolio of product offerings,\" USPS told FOX Television Stations in part. \"As a result of our new approach, some businesses negotiated new agreements with us, and some have not. We concluded our negotiations in December 2024. Our Parcel Select product still exists, and any business can use it now at our published rates.\"\n\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents UPS drivers, noted the \"increased volume related to UPS\u2019s SurePost contract\" in a recent Facebook post .\n\n\"The increase in volume provides more delivery opportunities and access to overtime for rank-and-file UPS Teamsters,\" the post reads. \"Improved guardrails around SurePost, which saw smaller packages routed off UPS package cars to be delivered by the USPS, were a critical gain for UPS Teamsters during record contract negotiations in 2023. Contract enhancements helped ensure UPS Teamsters were delivering more packages.\"\n\nWith \"millions of packages\" returning to UPS trucks, thousands of new Teamsters jobs will be created, the Teamsters\u2019 Facebook post added.",

The humanitarian sector is facing unprecedented challenges, including:\n\nSevere funding shortages: In 2023, UN global appeals were funded at only 52%, down from an average of In 2023, UN global appeals were funded at only 52%, down from an average of 58% between 2016 and 2022 . This drop was caused by rising costs, economic issues, and increased needs.\n\nIncreased number of forcibly displaced people worldwide: We are witnessing a We are witnessing a historic high in the number of forcibly displaced people . Conflicts, climate change and economic instability are pushing millions from their homes. The sheer scale of displacement requires coordinated, scalable solutions that the private sector is uniquely positioned to provide. Businesses can offer expertise in supply chain management, job training, employment and more to support humanitarian efforts in ways that traditional actors cannot achieve alone.\n\nFragmented engagement: Despite the growing involvement of businesses in humanitarian work, much of it remains uncoordinated and ad hoc. Siloed relationships between companies and humanitarian organizations hinder scalable, timely responses. There is a pressing need for more strategic, collaborative partnerships that can harness the full potential of the private sector\u2019s resources and capabilities. By aligning their efforts with global humanitarian priorities, businesses can ensure that their contributions are both impactful and sustainable.\n\nThe private sector remains one of the most critical yet underrecognized actors funding humanitarian crisis response. Highlighted during September\u2019s United Nations\u2019 (UN) Security Council meeting as a model partnership providing pro bono logistical support during large-scale emergencies, LET\u2019s efforts in 2024, including critical responses in Gaza and Lebanon, exemplify the impact of such collaborations.\n\nFor example, LET partners leveraged their global warehouse networks to support the Gaza and Lebanon responses. Both UPS and Maersk swiftly set up and staffed warehouses to manage the influx of donations, ensuring that aid was efficiently received, sorted and distributed where it was needed most.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn Gaza, when fuel shortages became a critical bottleneck for humanitarian operations, Agility mobilized its subsidiaries to donate and strategically position fuel supplies. This enabled humanitarian organizations to continue their vital work without disruption, ensuring that lifesaving aid reached affected communities.\n\nThese examples highlight how private sector capabilities can address logistical challenges and enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian responses.\n\nHow the PSHA is transforming crisis response\n\nThe PSHA aims to establish a formal coordinating mechanism for businesses during crises, offering a structured entry point for corporate involvement.\n\nDiscover How is the World Economic Forum helping to improve humanitarian assistance? Show more Fragility and conflict in one country often has consequences around the world. This has been evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous climate emergencies as well as the war in Ukraine and the ensuing refugee crisis. Regions affected by conflict are particularly vulnerable to the devastating impacts of these crises.\n\n\n\nUrgent relief, supported by public-private partnerships, remains necessary in acute crises but it is essential those efforts are supplemented by long-term investments that help affected communities recover and rebuild.\n\nThe World Economic Forum is working with partners to identify and scale solutions in fragile parts of the world. The Humanitarian and Resilience Investing (HRI) Initiative seeks to unlock private capital so it flows into financially sustainable opportunities that benefit vulnerable communities. The Global Future Council on the New Agenda for Fragility and Resilience provides guidance to humanitarian and development actors as well as the private sector to improve support to local actors and facilitate responses that strengthen community resilience. To learn more and get involved in initiatives that are improving millions of lives, contact us.\n\nBy leveraging the existing response infrastructure of public sector and nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners, the PSHA enhances private sector engagement, streamlines communication and prevents duplication of efforts.\n\nPSHA\u2019s strengths include:\n\nStreamlined processes: Coordinated private sector contributions that align with global response strategies.\n\nStandardized solutions: Development of scalable methods for crisis engagement within the private sector.\n\nTechnological innovation: A centralized platform offering critical information and guidance for businesses during humanitarian crises.\n\nUPS expertise supports humanitarian response\n\nUPS\u2019s long-standing partnership with the LET and the new partnership with the PSHA exemplifies the transformative power of public-private collaboration. By combining UPS\u2019s logistical expertise with innovative coordination models, UPS is charting a new path to drive sustainable impact at scale.\n\nCore strength in logistics: UPS leans into its expertise in transportation and supply chain management, designing and executing solutions to complex challenges in humanitarian aid delivery.\n\nSustainability leadership: UPS\u2019s fleet of more than UPS\u2019s fleet of more than 18,300 alternative fuel vehicles and investments in innovative sustainable solutions position it to help create resilient, eco-friendly supply chains.\n\nHealthcare and cold chain capabilities: Building on its extensive experience in cold chain delivery and customs clearance, UPS helps overcome critical challenges in delivering life-saving medical supplies.\n\nBy mobilizing these capabilities, UPS maximizes its contributions to the LET network, leveraging employee volunteer hours to create a lasting impact.\n\nIn 2024, UPS played a pivotal role in the LET\u2019s responses by participating in weekly partner meetings to identify and address bottlenecks for the Logistics Cluster, and providing critical assets and expertise to support smaller humanitarian response organizations.\n\nFor example, after inquiring about their needs, UPS employees provided various humanitarian organizations guidance on sourcing, warehousing and cross-border documentation. UPS also offered customs advice for goods transiting through Egypt for Gaza.\n\nExpanding the vision by building on unique strengths\n\nThe PSHA emphasizes that every business has a unique \u201csuperpower\u201d \u2013 an industry-specific capability that can address humanitarian challenges.\n\nLoading...\n\nContributions are not limited to logistics providers like the LET members. Companies across industries \u2013 from technology and telecommunications to healthcare, consumer goods and finance \u2013 have the potential to make significant contributions.\n\nThis vision promotes a collaborative model, integrating diverse private sector actors into the global humanitarian architecture. Expanding successful models like the LET into broader frameworks ensures more coordinated, effective disaster responses.\n\nHow the private sector can help transform the humanitarian response\n\nThe LET and PSHA demonstrate the power of private sector collaboration in reshaping humanitarian response. Together, they call on businesses across all industries to join this transformative effort.\n\nBy uniting capabilities and expertise with public and nonprofit organizations, the PSHA envisions a humanitarian system where businesses have a formal seat at the table. This modernized approach fosters collaboration, innovation and efficiency, making a meaningful, measurable difference in crisis response.",

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Drax Group\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Drax Group\n\nThe Independent Non-Executive Director Robert Shuter made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for UK\u00a3517k worth of shares at a price of UK\u00a36.46 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being UK\u00a36.30). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Robert Shuter.\n\nYou can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nLSE:DRX Insider Trading Volume January 19th 2025\n\nDrax Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find small cap companies at attractive valuations, this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nDrax Group Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Drax Group. Specifically, Chief Commercial Officer Paul Sheffield ditched UK\u00a350k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nDoes Drax Group Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Drax Group insiders own 0.6% of the company, worth about UK\u00a314m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Drax Group Insiders?\n\nOur data shows a little more insider selling, but no insider buying, in the last three months. However, the sales are not big enough to concern us at all. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Drax Group insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Drax Group (1 is significant!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.",

The more data centers, the greater the demand for high-capacity transformers.Market analysts forecast that the global transformer market will grow to $123 billion in 2033 from $72 billion in 2024.Due to the surge in demand for transformers, the transformer supply bottleneck in the US has worsened in recent years.According to global energy industry research firm Wood Mackenzie, transformer manufacturing lead time \u2014 the period between an order being placed and completed \u2014 has steadily increased in the US over the past two years to as long as 115 to 130 weeks, while the lead time for large ultra-high-capacity transformers is estimated at 120 to 210 weeks.This means that transformer suppliers have the upper hand in order negotiations.According to HD Hyundai Electric\u2019s internal data, it will also take as long as five years to deliver the transformers now on order to their owners.To meet this insatiable demand, the company has been running its transformer plants in Korea and the US at full capacity.The company fears that without production capacity ramp-ups, it would not be able to meet delivery deadlines.HD Hyundai Electric also plans to increase this year\u2019s investment in research and development more than 30% over last year to advance its ultra-high-capacity transformer technology to stay ahead of its rivals in the US.North America\u2019s Delta Star and Pennsylvania Transformer Technology, Japanese players such as Hitachi Energy and Mitsubishi Electric, as well as Germany\u2019s Siemens Energy are rushing to beef up investment in the US transformer market.HD Hyundai Electric holds the largest share of the US market for ultra-high-capacity transformers weighing 200 tons or more per unit and costing up to 13 billion won each.The company will also develop new technologies such as eco-friendly transformers. HD Hyundai Electric\u2019s power equipment orders in the US reached $1.78 billion in 2023, a fourfold increase from $390 million in 2021. CEO Cho Seok, who has led HD Hyundai Electric\u2019s dramatic turnaround since his term began in 2019 , was promoted to company vice chairman from president late last year.Sang Hoon Sung and Jin-Won Kim at uphoon@hankyung.com Sookyung Seo edited this article.",

            "content": "Inter\u2019s Serie A title defense continues on Sunday night with a must-win home clash against perennial bottom-half strugglers Empoli. After Napoli\u2019s stunning win at Atalanta last evening, Simone Inzaghi\u2019s men head into proceedings six points adrift of the table\u2019s summit.\n\nDespite lagging behind Antonio Conte\u2019s side, the reigning Scudetto holders have two games in hand. However, given Napoli\u2019s formidable form in Serie A, Inter can\u2019t take anything for granted. Inzaghi\u2019s charges wasted a glorious opportunity to close the gap during midweek.\n\nIndeed, goals from Denzel Dumfries and Lautaro Martinez were in vain as Bologna held them to a 2-2 draw at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. It was a bitter pill for the 20-time Italian champions, especially as Mehdi Taremi squandered two late chances to win the game for his team.\n\nTherefore, the margin for error narrowed down ahead of Empoli\u2019s visit. Visiting coach Roberto D\u2019Aversa oversaw another underwhelming result last weekend as Empoli slumped to a 3-1 home defeat to fellow bottom-half rivals Lecce, compromising their survival chances.\n\nFour losses from their last five league games (D1) have plunged the Azzurri closer to the bottom three, with only two points separating them from 18th-placed Cagliari ahead of the kickoff. A point at Meazza would be massive, yet that\u2019s easier said than done.\n\nMatch Preview\n\nInter\n\nBefore Bologna held them winless, Inter had won six league matches on the trot, including five without conceding. As such, they should take the field in high spirits despite the midweek heartache, especially as they\u2019ve not lost any of their last 14 Serie A fixtures (W11, D3).\n\nRemarkably, Inter are the only team in Italy\u2019s top flight yet to trail at halftime this season (HT: W10, D9). Another flying start would likely set the tone for the home side\u2019s 15th win in their last 16 league meetings with Empoli \u2013 except for a 1-0 loss on this ground in January 2023.\n\nHowever, Meazza has been a feeble fortress of late. Inter have only won half of their last eight top-flight outings on home turf (W4, D3, L1), conceding an alarming 12 goals in that sequence. That\u2019s over two-thirds of their overall seasonal tally in Serie A!\n\nFour successive league wins against Empoli \u2018to nil\u2019 can inspire confidence as Inzaghi\u2019s lads seek an immediate return to the win column. Anything less than three points would be unacceptable for Inter now that they must play catch-up on Napoli.\n\nEmpoli\n\nD\u2019Aversa would likely sign up for a draw before the kickoff. But visiting fans shouldn\u2019t hold their breath, considering the last time Empoli shared the spoils with Inter was in 2015. The head-to-head picture looks bleak afterward. So does the visitors\u2019 dire form.\n\nEmpoli have conceded multiple goals in three of their last four league games, capitulating at least twice against Atalanta, Genoa, and Lecce. A 1-1 away draw against newcomers Venezia was the only exception to this disheartening streak, highlighting the depth of the crisis.\n\nThe situation could go from bad to worse this weekend unless D\u2019Aversa posts his first-ever managerial win against Inzaghi (D1, L10). Determined to defy his career-worst record against another manager, the veteran coach can find inspiration in Empoli\u2019s impressive away form.\n\nGli Azzurri have only lost three competitive matches on the road this season (W5, D4), though one defeat came on this ground at the hands of Inter\u2019s bitter adversaries Milan. Ominously, the other two arrived against Nerazzurri\u2019s fellow top-four rivals.\n\nTeam News\n\nInter are still without talismanic midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu, who sustained a muscle injury during the club\u2019s Supercoppa Italiana trip to Saudi Arabia. Francesco Acerbi is also out with a long-term thigh issue. Inzaghi hopes to have Yann Bisseck back but can\u2019t count on Argentine misfit Joaquin Correa.\n\nOn the other hand, Empoli will land at Meazza without numerous first-team stars. Tino Anjorin and Ola Solbakken have joined long-term absentees Pietro Pellegri, Nicolas Haas, Saba Sazonov, and Tyronne Ebuehi on the sidelines, leaving D\u2019Aversa stranded for reliable options in all departments.\n\nInter vs Empoli Potential Starting Line-ups\n\nInter (3-5-2): Sommer; Pavard, De Vrij, Augusto; Dumfries, Barella, Asllani, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Martinez, Thuram.\n\nEmpoli (3-5-1-1): Vasquez; Goglichidze, Ismajli, Viti; Gyasi, Henderson, Grassi, Cacace, Pezzella; Esposito; Colombo.\n\nInter vs Empoli Prediction\n\nSeverely hit by injuries, Empoli shouldn\u2019t stand a chance at Meazza. We expect Inter to post another clear-cut victory and keep their lowly visitors at bay.\n\nPrediction: Inter to Win",

            "content": "The muscles worked by push-ups include the chest, shoulders, back, core, and arm muscles. This classic exercise has held its ground as countless fitness trends have come and gone and is a great addition to any workout.\n\nThere are several ways to modify or amplify your push-ups. You can also stick with the traditional technique. It's important to use proper form and pair push-ups with a few other exercises that work complementary muscles.\n\nWhat Muscles Do Push-Ups Work?\n\nPush-ups strengthen your chest, shoulders, back, core, and arm muscles. You are also primarily working your shoulder joint. It takes upper body strength to move down and back up. Your midsection fires to maintain that straight-line body position as you go.\n\nYou can categorize almost any exercise as either a push or pull movement. The push-up falls into the push pattern, a function you perform in your daily life.\n\n\"The push-up challenges all pushing motions, including pushing yourself out of bed in the morning, moving furniture or other items around the house, pushing a cart at the grocery store, lifting something heavy off our chest,\" Charlee Atkins, CSCS, New York-based trainer and founder of Le Sweat and Le Sweat TV, told Health. The stronger you get at push-ups, the easier these daily activities become.\n\nHow To Maintain Proper Form\n\nYou move your body from the top of a straight-arm plank down to the floor and back up again to do a push-up. It's important to keep your body in one straight line and check your form.\n\nCheck Your Elbows\n\nYour elbows should point back 45 degrees into an A-shape rather than a T. \"The direction of the elbow determines what's happening at the joint. If your elbows are in the shape of a T, you're wreaking havoc on your rotator cuff due to the extreme internal rotation,\" said Atkins. Your rotator cuff is the muscles and tendons that surround your shoulder joint.\n\nYou are doing a triceps push-up if you are pulling your elbows in toward your sides. This is not necessarily wrong, but you are not recruiting your chest and back muscles as much as the 45-degree angle.\n\nFocus on Your Core\n\nIt's key to tighten your core as you do push-ups. It means your middle is not engaged enough to maintain a strong plank if your hips drop or you bring your butt to the sky. \"Tuck the tailbone [slightly forward] to put the pelvis in a posterior tilt to help protect the lower back,\" said Atkins.\n\nWatch Your Alignment\n\nKeep your neck in neutral alignment to keep the straight line even straighter. Do not let your head bobble or your chin tuck toward your chest. This can create tension in the neck and shoulders. Take your gaze to the front of the mat or in front of your hands.\n\nMake sure your shoulders stay right over your wrists to keep your body stable and maximize the pushing mechanics. Shift your weight slightly forward as you lower down to keep this position.\n\nYour hands should also be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your thumbs should touch your armpits at the bottom of the move.\n\nAdjust Your Feet\n\nRemember that the closer your feet are together, the more challenging the push-up. The farther away they are from each other, the more stable your body is. Keep your feet hip-distance apart as you train.\n\nModifications\n\nYou have probably seen people drop their knees to the ground to modify their push-ups. Atkins recommended skipping this variation. There are other ways to make a push-up easier or harder.\n\n\"When you drop to the knees, you completely eliminate half of your body weight and train improper body mechanics,\" said Atkins. \"A very crucial part of having the ability to do a push-up is maintaining a strong core. The goal of a push-up is to have the ability to press the equivalent of your body weight away from you.\"\n\nIncline Push-Ups\n\nPlace your hands on a couch, chair, table, or bench and perform push-ups at an incline. You still maintain the straight line and get used to moving your entire body. Simply bring the incline lower until you can maintain a strong plank form while doing a push-up on the ground.\n\n\"The way you train the body is the way it's going to respond,\" said Atkins. \"The incline decreases the amount of bodyweight or load put on the arms and shoulders, but as you progressively lower, you progressively add load to the upper body in a manageable way.\"\n\nMore Challenging Push-ups\n\nAtkins suggested reversing the incline and elevating your feet to make push-ups more challenging. You can use yoga blocks, your couch, a chair, or a bench.\n\nYou can also switch up the tempo to make a push-up more difficult. Try pausing for a count of 3-5 at the bottom or lower to the ground on a count of six. The goal is to increase the time under tension, which helps strengthen your muscles.\n\nExercises To Pair With Push-Ups\n\nIt's fine to do push-ups every day, but you want to also work the opposing muscles. For some options to add to your regular routine, Atkins suggested:\n\nBent-over rows with dumbbells\n\nInverted rows (with a TRX or hold onto the edge of a heavy table if you can get a good grip on it)\n\nLocust pose\n\nPull-ups\n\nRenegade rows with dumbbells (in a plank position)\n\nThese exercises all work your pull movement pattern and the back of the body. They help you maintain posture and 360 degrees of strength in your upper body.\n\nA Quick Review\n\nPush-ups are simple, effective exercises that build strength. They work your chest, shoulders, back, core, and arm muscles. Take care to follow proper technique and form to maximize the exercise's benefits. It's also important to pair push-ups with complementary exercises that work the opposing muscles.",

(0:37)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nATHENS, Ga. -- Tahaad Pettiford hit 5 of 7 shots from 3-point range, scoring 24 off the bench to help No. 1 Auburn escape No. 23 Georgia with a 70-68 win Saturday.\n\nAuburn (17-1, 5-0 SEC) has won 10 in a row and a second straight game without star Johni Broome, who injured his ankle in a Jan. 11 win over South Carolina.\n\n\"We just holding it down for him, waiting for him to get back,\" Pettiford said of playing without Broome. \"He's a big key to this team, but we can do it without him and we're showing it. He trusts all of us and everybody gotta trust in each other to do it.\n\nGeorgia (14-4, 2-3) struggled with free throws, making 9 of 20 from the line.\n\nThe Bulldogs suffered their first home loss of the season (11-1), snapping a 13-game winning streak at Stegeman Coliseum -- the fourth-longest home winning streak in program history.\n\nDown 70-67 with nine seconds to play in regulation, Georgia had a chance to tie the game at 70 after a Miles Kelly turnover led to Dakota Leffew getting a look from 3 with seven seconds to go. His shot was too strong. Asa Newell had a chance to tie it at the buzzer, but missed.\n\n\"I knew we had it,\" Pettiford said. \"I knew that the guys that were in... they wanted it all, they wanted to win. I knew they were gonna do whatever it takes to make sure they didn't get that last bucket.\"\n\nThe win improves Auburn to 6-1 against AP Top 25 opponents this season, the best record of any team. It ties its most wins against AP ranked opponents in a single season in the AP Poll era (since 1948-49), according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.",

That means UPS is delivering all of its own packages.\n\n\"We are overloaded, which is a good thing and a bad thing because it kind of caught workers off guard,\" said Hooker.\n\nThe change has been hard to understand for some customers.\n\n\"Our customers are very confused about where it goes,\" said Debbie Anday from Stash Spot Mailbox Services in Philadelphia, a mailbox rental service neighbors use to safely store their packages.\n\n\"You can have your packages mailed to us, you're notified when they come in and you come in and pick them up whenever you're ready,\" said Anday.\n\nThe owner says now that the SurePost contract expired, some customers have been confused about where to have their packages sent, especially since only the Postal Service can deliver to P.O. Boxes.\n\n\"You're wasting your time dropping it off to the wrong place or you're also at risk of completely losing that package and never seeing it again,\" she said.\n\nBecause of this, customers have to be careful about where they ship their packages. If it's UPS, it has to be a physical address.\n\nThe Teamsters union says despite the confusion, this is a good thing for workers.\n\n\"Our UPS members are getting more of that work which creates more jobs, more opportunities for overtime,\" said Hooker.",

            "content": "A study by researchers at Mount Sinai has shown that wearable devices like Apple Watches, Fitbits, and Oura Rings can predict flare-ups in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), potentially revolutionizing how this chronic condition is monitored and managed. Published in Gastroenterology, the research demonstrates how physiological data collected by these devices can provide early warning signs of worsening inflammation or symptoms, up to seven weeks before flare-ups occur.\n\n\u201cCurrent disease-monitoring methods rely on patients directly interacting with their doctors, through office visits, blood or stool tests, or colonoscopies,\u201d said Robert Hirten, MD, clinical director of the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai.\n\n\u201cThese methods only assess the disease at one point in time and can often be invasive or inconvenient. Our study shows that wearable devices offer a noninvasive and continuous way to monitor chronic inflammatory diseases like IBD.\u201d\n\nIBD, which includes Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, affects over 2.4 million people in the United States. In the study, more than 300 participants from 36 states wore wearable devices, completed daily symptom surveys, and provided blood and stool samples to assess inflammation.\n\nResearchers observed that metrics like heart rate variability, heart rate, oxygenation, and daily activity patterns, measured by the devices, were significantly altered throughout periods of inflammation. During the flare ups, heart rate and resting heart rate were increased while the number of daily steps reduced.\n\nCrucially, these metrics could detect intestinal inflammation even before symptoms appeared, distinguishing inflammation-driven symptoms from those caused by other factors.\n\nThe findings pave the way for wearable devices to play a central role in disease management, offering patients a real-time and less intrusive alternative to traditional methods. Beyond IBD, the researchers are expanding their work to apply similar approaches to other chronic inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. By incorporating artificial intelligence, the team is developing algorithms to use wearable device data for personalized flare-up predictions.\n\n\u201cThese findings open the door to leveraging wearable technology for health monitoring and disease management in innovative ways,\u201d said Hirten. \u201cOur hope is that, in the future, this approach will significantly enhance the quality of life of our patients.\u201d\n\nThis study marks a major step forward in integrating wearable technology into healthcare, providing a glimpse into a future where chronic diseases can be managed more proactively and effectively.",

Apu Gomes/Getty Images\n\nWildfires are on the mind here in California. It\u2019s still not clear exactly to what degree the devastating Los Angeles fires were the product of gross mismanagement by the city and state governments, with lots of new details still emerging about the steps they could have taken and didn\u2019t.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nIt\u2019s abundantly clear that the city and state screwed up. State insurance price controls forced homeowners off good private insurance and onto the last-resort state insurance program, which is about to go catastrophically bankrupt, passing on its liabilities to every homeowner in the state. Reservoirs that should have been full were empty. The city government had plenty of reason to believe that risk was catastrophically elevated this week, but the mayor took an international trip and the fire department seems to have been caught flat-footed.\n\nRelated Your fixation on celebrity wildfire victims has an unexpected benefit\n\nBut what has truly been infuriating, at least in the California policy circles I run in, has been not the mistakes in the lead-up to the disaster, but the response in the aftermath. The governor and mayor have not responded by reconsidering any of California\u2019s bad forest management policy. They don\u2019t have a plan to secure fire insurance for homeowners in other at-risk areas, and they definitely don\u2019t have a plan to manage the cascading problems that will be caused by the bankruptcy of the state insurance program.\n\nThat prompted a few questions, such as, \u201cWait, he can do that?\u201d and \u201cIf he has that power, why is he using it to rebuild in wildfire-prone, at-risk areas and not to expedite building in safe parts of a state buckling under a housing scarcity crisis?\u201d\n\nAnd with all of those, there\u2019s a deeper question that feels existential for the state of California: Is there any leadership at all? Is anyone thinking about the big picture in America\u2019s biggest state, and do they have a plan to avoid making tragedies like this one an annual ritual?\n\nThere are no grown-ups\n\nOne thing that catastrophe often makes clear is that there isn\u2019t anyone behind the scenes who steps in once things get really bad. It\u2019s just the people who were there all along, with the foibles they had all along.\n\nCovid was a stark illustration of this. I think many people had \u2014 I certainly did \u2014 a romantic view of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the hero pandemic scientists who would swoop in with advanced tools and pull out their meticulously planned pandemic roadmaps as soon as things looked tough. America was rated the highest readiness in the world for pandemic preparedness, after all.\n\nAnd then the CDC whiffed. Its tests didn\u2019t work; it put in place unhelpful barriers to using the tests that did. Its messaging was confusing \u2014 masks were bad, but also we needed to save them for healthcare workers. No, wait, never mind, masks were mandatory.\n\nThere were plenty of individuals who did plenty of heroics to try to see what was coming and do something about it, but there weren\u2019t any institutions waiting behind the scenes to save the day. When we got vaccines, it was a bunch of well-meaning private actors organized on Discord who did much of the legwork to make them accessible to the public, often by systematically calling every pharmacy to put in a spreadsheet whether they had availability.\n\nA lot of the disillusionment I\u2019ve been seeing from Californians in the last few days has this specific flavor \u2014 the realization that no, no matter how bad things get, the real grown-ups can\u2019t be called in to save the day because they don\u2019t exist.\n\nAnd there is no one to step in when Newsom fails to do that, though I\u2019ve seen a lot of people wistfully wishing that the federal government would condition aid on the state government stepping up.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s real state of emergency\n\nThe reason Newsom has the authority for an executive order waiving environmental review and permits so that people can quickly rebuild homes that burned down is that he declared a state of emergency surrounding the fires, and in a state of emergency the governor has expanded powers. (How expanded? It\u2019s mostly a question of whether anyone wants to challenge this executive order in court.)\n\nThere\u2019s no question, of course, that the catastrophic LA fires are an emergency. But it was predictable that we\u2019d face exactly such an emergency. Across California, it\u2019s often all but illegal to build housing in the parts of the state that are safest from disaster risk. That pushes housing to the fringes, where it\u2019s likelier to burn. This isn\u2019t a secret. It was widely discussed after the catastrophic fires that destroyed the city of Paradise and other exurban California communities in 2019.\n\nIt is our choice, as a society, that we govern reactively rather than proactively, that we treat the awful policies that encourage building in fire-prone areas as not an emergency and only the resultant fires as one, that we do not treat the state\u2019s huge homelessness crisis as an emergency.\n\nBut if we don\u2019t like living in a perpetual state of emergency, it\u2019s the wrong choice.\n\nCalifornia is in a state of emergency, and not from the Los Angeles fires. One of the most prosperous, populous, beautiful corners of the world has been mismanaged and misgoverned into a state of extreme fragility that is damaging the hopes and aspirations of its people and burning trillions of dollars of its potential.

USPS previously provided a cost-effective way to reach remote areas, but without this service, Iowans may need to use a UPS Store mailbox or make other arrangements for receiving packages.\n\nUnsplash/Canva/TSM Unsplash/Canva/TSM loading...\n\nPost Office Boxes Will Be Impacted\n\nIndividuals and businesses that use post office boxes for receiving UPS packages may need to adjust their shipping methods. They will now have to have packages shipped directly to a physical street address rather than a P.O. Box, which could be an issue for those living in rural areas without an easily accessible street address.\n\nImpact on Small Business\n\nUSA Today says that small businesses in Iowa that rely on affordable delivery options for shipping and receiving goods could face higher shipping costs or logistical challenges. If they cannot rely on the postal system to handle the final delivery, they may need to switch to other carriers or adapt their shipping methods.\n\nIowans Frustration Could Be Mirrored Elsewhere\n\nSome Vermonters expressed frustration trying to get packages delivered, not knowing about the end of the SurePost program. Similar to the case in Vermont, Iowans may also experience frustration if they weren't notified about the change, particularly if they depend on online shopping for goods not available locally. This could lead to confusion and inconvenience when trying to receive packages during the transition period.\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nWhile Iowa might not be the hardest-hit state, rural areas and small businesses may face challenges adjusting to the end of UPS SurePost and the shift away from USPS handling final delivery.\n\nPalisades-Kepler State Park December 30, 2024 Early Morning hours just after sunrise at Palisades-Kepler State Park, I saw a few friendly faces.

            "content": "Mount Sinai Study Finds Wearable Devices Can Detect and Predict Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flare-Ups Data collected by wearable technology can identify disease flare-ups up to seven weeks in advance\n\nWearable devices can identify, differentiate, and predict flare-ups, or the worsening of symptoms and inflammation, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Mount Sinai researchers have shown in a first-of-its-kind study.\n\nThe findings, published in the journal Gastroenterology on January 16, suggest that wearable technology can predict the subsequent development of flares in IBD, enabling continuous disease monitoring through widely available commercial devices.\n\n\u201cCurrent disease-monitoring methods rely on patients directly interacting with their doctors, either through office visits, blood or stool testing, or by undergoing a colonoscopy. These methods also only assess the disease at one point in time, and can often be invasive or inconvenient,\u201d said first author Robert Hirten, MD, Clinical Director of the Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health; and Associate Professor of Medicine (Gastroenterology), and Artificial Intelligence and Human Health, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cOur study shows that commonly used wearable devices such as Apple Watches, Fitbits, and Oura Rings can be effective tools in monitoring chronic inflammatory diseases like IBD. This creates an opportunity to monitor the disease remotely outside the health care setting, in a continuous manner, and potentially in real time.\u201d\n\nIBD is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the intestines and affects more than 2.4 million people in the United States. Mount Sinai researchers enrolled more than 300 participants with ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease, the two major types of IBD, from 36 states. The participants wore devices, answered daily symptom surveys, and provided blood and stool assessments of inflammation.\n\nThe researchers found that circadian patterns of heart rate variability (a marker of nervous system function), along with heart rate, oxygenation, and daily activity, all measured by the wearable devices, were significantly altered when inflammation or symptoms were present. Moreover, these physiological markers could detect inflammation even in the absence of symptoms and distinguish whether symptoms were driven by active inflammation in the intestines. Importantly, the researchers found that these metrics measured by wearables changed up to seven weeks before flares developed.\n\nThe researchers are applying similar approaches to other chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and leveraging artificial intelligence to develop algorithms using wearable device data to predict flares on an individualized basis. \u201cThese findings open the door to leveraging wearable technology for health monitoring and disease management in innovative ways we haven\u2019t previously considered,\u201d Dr. Hirten said. \u201cOur hope is that, in the future, this approach will significantly enhance the quality of life of our patients.\u201d",

So far, the addition of millions of Surepost packages has meant that post-peak layoffs have gotten off to a slow start. But many drivers are also facing massive loads and long hours. Our 9.5 protections against excessive overtime are in effect as of January 15. Enforcing the contract is the best way to guard against the twin threats of excessive overtime and layoffs.\n\n9.5 Rights Are in Effect - Use Them!\n\nIf you signed the 9.5 list, make sure to file a grievance if you work over 9.5 hours three times in a week. UPS must pay triple time for those hours.\n\nIf you have not signed the 9.5 list yet, use the Add/Cut form to sign up now.\n\nUnder the new contract, if UPS violates your 9.5 rights more than four times, you are entitled to an elevated meeting with the District Labor Manager to get your route adjusted. Violations of 9.5 after an elevated meeting pay out at quadruple time.\n\nThe sooner you start filing 9.5 grievances, the sooner you will qualify to get your route reduced or quadruple time penalty pay for hours over 9.5.\n\n9.5 protections went into effect immediately on January 15\u2014no waiting period. If you work over 9.5 hours three times between today and Saturday this week, make sure to file a grievance.\n\nNote: The Local 705 and 710 Agreements feature different 9.5 language. Members in those locals should reference their Local's agreement.\n\nWorking Safe & Smart on Local Sorts\n\nThe end of Surepost has also created a mess in many local sorts that were designed for bulk bagging of packages bound for the post office. The end of Surepost has led to overflowing belts and egress issues.\n\nSupervisors should not be touching packages. If they do, file a grievance and make UPS pay for supervisors working violations. Click here for contract enforcement tips.\n\nWill Volume Stay Up?\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen to volume in the wake of Surepost. Some customers may move away to low-cost carriers as UPS raises prices. Other customers, especially the big volume ones, will want to stick with UPS because of service and reliability.\n\nUPS is creating a new service called UPS Ground Saver. This lower-cost service comes with a catch: \u201cThe time and date of any package tendered for UPS Ground Saver is not guaranteed.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s UPS Ground Saver agreement says that final delivery of packages can be done by UPS or the USPS. This leaves the door open for UPS to reach a future agreement with the postal service. But for now, UPS has confirmed that its agreement with the USPS is terminated.\n\nEnforcing the Contract Together\n\nThe end of peak means \u201cHunting Season\u201d is on at UPS with layoffs, petty discipline and harassment. The end of Surepost may change what that looks like this year, but it\u2019s coming. Enforcing the contract together is the best way to protect ourselves.\n\nRegister now for a webinar on protecting your rights at UPS after peak. The webinar will be held on Sunday, February 2 at noon Eastern, 11am Central, 10am Mountain, 9am Pacific. Pre-registration is required.",

            "content": "On January 1, the SurePost relationship between Atlanta-based global freight transportation and logistics services provider UPS and the United States Postal Service (USPS) officially came to an end, upon the expiration of the companies\u2019 negotiated service agreement (NSA).\n\nIntroduced in early 2011 by UPS, SurePost is an economy ground service for delivery to residential locations. It is a \u201ccontract-only service that combines the consistency and reliability of the UPS Ground network, from pickup through transferring to the Post Office, with the cost benefits of using the United States Postal Service (USPS) for final delivery,\u201d according to UPS.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to leverage our track record of industry-leading service and reliability, we are insourcing our SurePost product, effective January 1,\u201d UPS said in a statement on the Investors section of its website. \u201cThis product is an important part of the broad portfolio of end-to-end services available to UPS customers. By leveraging the strength and flexibility of our integrated network, insourcing will allow us to control the SurePost volume from point-to-point, provide reliable service and meet our customers\u2019 needs more efficiently.\u201d\n\nFor its part, USPS recently explained that prior agreements it has had with package consolidators have \u201cfailed to reflect operational and financial realities,\u201d adding that its Parcel Select product, (which SurePost is ostensibly part of, in that SurePost packages were shipped using USPS\u2019s Parce Select service) remains available for any business to use at its published rates.\n\nIn a research note, Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Garrett Holland wrote that in its third quarter earnings last October, UPS expressed optimism that it would be able to find a mutual agreement [with USPS] and was confident the company could work through negotiations.\n\n\u201cUPS is still marketing a SurePost solution for shippers, but recent changes to the scope of service include no more delivery service to PO boxes, AK, HI, PR, or APO/FPO addresses,\u201d wrote Holland. \u201cRecent pricing actions now better explain the relationship changes as well. On 12/16/24, UPS announced SurePost surcharges effective 1/13/25 including ~10% for packages 9 lbs. and under, ~6%-7% for packages weighing 10-70 lbs., and ~62%-69% for extended deliveries (rural and low-density area customers most exposed).\n\nWe estimate SurePost accounted for a mid-teens percentage of UPS Domestic volume. SurePost volume carried a lower revenue per piece, but given network productivity enhancements, UPS had already started to redirect more volume into its network, increasing delivery density. Full/immediate insourcing of the remaining estimated majority of SurePost volume carries near-term risk for the cost per piece and volume outlook, though pricing actions are clearly designed to mitigate the impact.\u201d\n\nJerry Hempstead, president of Orlando-based Hempstead Consulting, observed that this development has been stewing for some time, initially with Amazon going its own way and developing its known fleet of delivery vehicles, followed by FedEx deciding it was best to have its own drivers deliver the bulk of SmartPost shipments.\n\n\u201cNow the USPS has decided to divorce from UPS over irreconcilable differences,\u201d he said. \u201cFor whatever reason the USPS no longer desires parcels to be dropped off at the DDUs (Destination Delivery Unit, the post office closest to the recipient), where third parties could leverage the fact that the USPS had a vehicle and a carrier going to every address, every workday. In exchange for this work share the USPS had an extremely affordable price for the last mile. But consider that the USPS did not have to add one terminal, or any trucks, or any drivers to develop the Parcel Select DDU service offering.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, Hempstead noted that in the late 90s, former Postmaster General Marvin Runyon saw a great opportunity in work share in the parcel space, built a great team, and set out to recapture its fair share of the parcel market.\n\n\u201cBecause of the rapid development of the Internet at this time two realities hit the USPS: First class mail (the major source of revenue for the USPS) was going to decline; and because of the development of e-commerce, parcel transactions, especially to residences was going to take off. Parcel Select, I believe, has been the fastest growing offering at the USPS over past 25 years.\u201d\n\nPaul Yaussy, Sr. Director of Parcel Consulting, for San Diego-based Shipware, told LM that with the UPS NSA with the USPS having expired with no future plans to reinstate it, UPS is now delivering all SurePost packages through its own ground network as part of the company\u2019s \u201cnetwork of the future\u201d transformation, leaving shippers scrambling to find a replacement with no notice.\n\nAs for next steps, Yaussy said that what is likely going to happen is SurePost will transform into a product like FedEx Ground Economy, but, shippers will still need low-cost options for lightweight shipments.\n\n\u201cLook for UPS to eliminate SurePost as a service and launch its equivalent to FedEx Ground Economy, and look for it to be called Ground Saver, as we are seeing some occasional bids coming in with that nomenclature as part of the overall offering from UPS,\u201d said Yaussy. \u201cWhile this wasn\u2019t a surprise to many in the industry, this had to come as a surprise to shippers when their PO Box and Alaska/Hawaii shipment requests were being rejected by UPS. We\u2019ve seen a big drop off in sales reps\u2019 ability to communicate proactively any changes that are coming, so many shippers were likely left to scramble for ways to get those shipments moving. With all of the recent USPS changes lately, the elimination of consolidators delivering to DDUs, elimination of SurePost, etc., shippers with lightweight packages are taking on large price increases at slower transits. Something has to give here because you can justify price increases for better service, but not slower service.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nBoston Scientific updated its forecast for pulsed field ablation (PFA) adoption, predicting that more than 60% of atrial fibrillation (AFib) procedures globally will use the technology by 2026.\n\nThe forecast, which the company made at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference Monday, is up from the 40% to 60% by 2026 prediction management provided before launching a PFA device.\n\nBoston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney said the company is \u201ca clear market leader\u201d in PFA and the technology will fuel its rise from \u201ca distant number four\u201d in electrophysiology to number two this year.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nMahoney predicted Boston Scientific will claim the number two spot in the electrophysiology market by mid-2025 and then mount a push to become number one \u201cover the coming years.\u201d The forecast comes 10 months into the launch of Boston Scientific\u2019s Farapulse PFA device, which has helped drive the shift away from the use of radiofrequency energy and cryoablation to treat AFib.\n\nRivals have sought to mitigate Boston Scientific\u2019s threat by developing their own PFA devices but Abbott has yet to win approval and Johnson & Johnson paused use of its device last week. That leaves Medtronic, which recently called cardiac ablation a $9 billion segment, as Boston Scientific\u2019s current rival in PFA.\n\nBoston Scientific reported a 177% increase in global electrophysiology sales in the third quarter, growing the business to $527 million. Medtronic reported mid-single digit growth in cardiac ablation products in its most recent quarterly results. Medtronic groups PFA and other ablation devices with a broader set of cardiac rhythm and heart failure products that generated sales of nearly $1.6 billion in the quarter.\n\nAfter its successful PFA launch, Boston Scientific is embarking on initiatives to keep growing in 2025 and beyond. Evercore ISI analysts said in a note to investors that the company\u2019s management \u201csounded very comfortable around sustainability of growth\u201d at the J.P. Morgan event.\n\nBoston Scientific\u2019s PFA growth plan for 2025 includes expanding in China and Japan, further penetrating the U.S. and European markets and increasing use of its mapping system. Physicians can use Farapulse with rivals\u2019 mapping systems or operate without software. Still, Boston Scientific Chief Medical Officer Ken Stein said at J.P. Morgan that he expects more use of the company\u2019s Opal suite in 2025.\n\nAdditional clinical data and label expansions are part of Boston Scientific\u2019s plans for growing PFA sales in the longer term. The franchise could benefit from a label expansion for another Boston Scientific product in 2025. Last year, a Boston Scientific-funded trial found performing left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) at the same time as ablation lowered the risk of bleeding compared to using blood thinners.\n\nBoston Scientific sells a device, Watchman, that Mahoney said has a 90% share of the U.S. LAAC market. The company expects to expand the Watchman label to cover use in post-ablation patients in the second half of the year. Stein explained why performing ablation and LAAC at the same time is \u201cas close to a no-brainer as anything ever gets in medicine\u201d at J.P. Morgan.\n\n\u201cYou're taking two procedures that both involve essentially the same skill set and the same approach to the patient. Instead of having to have two procedures and have the attendant risks doubled, you can do it all at one sitting,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIt's great for patients, it's great for doctors and it's great for the whole ecosystem in terms of relieving some of the capacity constraints.\u201d\n\nCapacity constraints are a concern for Boston Scientific as it tries to rapidly ramp the use of its PFA and LAAC devices. Mahoney said lab capacity is \u201cone of the few headwinds\u201d the company could face in the future.\n\nBoston Scientific predicted at J.P. Morgan that the LAAC market will grow from $1.4 billion in 2023 to more than $6 billion in 2030. The company made the same forecast at an investor event in 2023.",

            "content": "4 Min Read \u2022 January 15, 2025\n\nIn the fast-paced world of car sales, each interaction with a potential customer is a chance to build trust, make a personal connection, and close a deal. While digital channels like email and text are essential, the phone call remains one of the dealership\u2019s most powerful tools.\n\nWith advanced phone technology, dealerships can directly personalize their customer experience with better service quality. Moving from an older platform to a cloud-based solution improves speed, reliability and competitiveness. Integrating a cloud system with DMS and CRM solutions further streamlines communication, enhances operations and strengthens customer engagement.\n\nHere are a few key insights to help leverage the power of phone communication in your dealership:\n\n1. Trust on the Line: Phone Calls Build Stronger Relationships\n\nThere\u2019s something about a human voice that builds trust in a way that digital communication can\u2019t match. When a customer hears a friendly, knowledgeable voice on the other end of the line, it gives them confidence that they\u2019re making the right choice. In a recent study, CDK found that 64% of shoppers book an appointment before ever coming into the dealership and a majority of them (44%) use the phone to schedule that appointment. These shoppers call because they're ready to buy and want the reassurance of speaking to a real person who can answer their questions.\n\nWhat you can do: Encourage your Sales team to invite prospects to the dealership while being prepared to answer their questions thoroughly. Emphasize transparency and honesty in every phone interaction to build trust and credibility, making customers more confident in moving forward with a purchase from your dealership.\n\n2. Speed Matters: Quick Follow-Ups Make a Difference\n\nIn the automotive industry, where customer decisions are shaped by experiences and emotions, prompt attention to your incoming calls and a quick follow-up can make the difference between winning and losing a sale.\n\nRecent CDK research showed that 81% of callers encountered a problem when trying to book a Sales appointment on the phone. Nearly a quarter were put on hold with an average hold time of 13 minutes! Another 13% said no one answered the call at all.\n\nWhat you can do: Create a consistent process to ensure all inbound calls are returned promptly, setting a goal to follow up within an hour or less as a priority for your Sales team. This quick response shows potential customers that you value their time and are eager to assist them.\n\n3. Minimize Missed Calls: Don\u2019t Let Phone Ups Slip Away\n\nMissed calls are missed opportunities. A recent study shows that 43% of qualified leads are mishandled \u2014 calls were missed, follow-up was delayed, or lead inquiries weren\u2019t logged to the CRM representing a significant leak in the Sales funnel. Dealers who understand the importance of inbound phone calls and optimize them close more deals.\n\nWhat you can do: Make sure your dealership is adequately staffed during peak call times, typically Mondays through Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to noon. Promptly follow up on missed calls to keep prospects engaged and log every interaction \u2014 including missed calls \u2014 in your CRM to effectively track leads. Treat every call as a valuable opportunity and optimize your phone processes so you can strengthen your Sales funnel.\n\n4. Know Your Customer: Integrate Your Phone Technology With Your CRM And DMS\n\nYou need to understand the customer\u2019s journey with your dealership to deliver personalized communications. When you know what a customer has already experienced across your dealership, you can tailor the conversation to address their specific needs and concerns, increasing the likelihood of conversion.\n\nWhat you can do: Train your Sales team to leverage customer data across your phone technology, CRM and DMS. Personalize each call based on customer data before they engage with the customer. This could include referencing previous interactions, phone call reports, service visits, acknowledging past purchases, or addressing known concerns. Pick up the phone and call the customer like you know them. This will provide that special interaction and make their experience more meaningful \u2014 and increase your chances of closing the sale.\n\nTransform Phone Calls Into Lasting Customer Connections\n\nThe phone is more than just a communication tool: It's the most essential part of your sales strategy! Focus on building trust through personal interaction, ensure timely follow-ups, minimize missed calls, and deliver personalized communication so your dealership can significantly enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately, drive more sales.\n\nLearn more or request a demo of CDK collaboration solutions that work.",

Kathy Hochul's administration's awarding a $9 billion contract to company Public Partnerships LLC to oversee the Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program, which gives self-directed home care to about 280,000 elderly and disabled people and allows them to choose their caregivers.\n\n\"It has been brought to light that the Hochul administration has handed a de facto sole-source contract \u2014 under the guise of Medicaid reform, with only the illusion of competitive bidding \u2014 to PPL while at the same time receiving consultation about Medicaid reform from PCG, whose executives just happen to have a 25% ownership interest in PPL,\" the congressman wrote to state Inspector General Lucy Lang and the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA home care provider filed a lawsuit in state Supreme court last month alleging the Hochul administration rigged the bidding process in a backroom deal during last year's budget negotiations.\n\nTorres, a Bronx Democrat, is a harsh critic of Hochul as he considers challenging her in 2026 to be the state's next Democratic nominee for governor. He sent his second letter on the matter a day after Hochul delivered her fourth State of the State address in Albany.\n\nTorres first contacted state and federal authorities last month to request a probe into how Hochul's administration handled bids for the contract.\n\nBoth offices confirmed receipt of the congressman's December request, but did not respond further.\n\n\"Ritchie Torres was horribly wrong when he supported defunding the police and he's horribly wrong when it comes to understanding our consumer-first approach to reforming CDPAP,\" said Avi Small, Hochul's press secretary. \"Instead of responding to his daily press stunts, this administration is laser-focused on our efforts to protect home care users and caregivers.\"",

Subscribe \u00bb\n\nTo view our entire 2025 Franchise 500 list, including category rankings, click HERE\n\nWhen Sarah Casalan became president of The UPS Store, Inc., a few years ago, she spent a week working in one of the stores herself. It's a customary experience for company leadership, intended to provide insight into what franchisees and customers alike could use help with. Sure enough, insight came on Casalan's first day in the store \u2014 in the form of a large stack of training binders. \"My head of instructional design would say that he remembers the day of that phone call very clearly,\" she says with a laugh.\n\nTo Casalan, it was immediately clear that all of this paperwork was the wrong approach. And since then, she's heard time and again from operators that a more sophisticated system was needed to prepare workers. Training binders are a vestige of the franchise's 1980s origins, not how you engage workers in the 2020s. So in 2024, the company successfully launched its first digital, mobile-friendly training system. The interactive training modules are much more enjoyable for workers, she says \u2014 and much more 21st century.\n\nRelated: Here's how we determined the annual Franchise 500 ranking \u2014 and what we learned from the data.\n\n\"The magic of The UPS Store happens over the counter,\" Casalan explains. \"If you can't meet someone's needs or solve their problems over the counter, it is terrifying and it'll ruin your day \u2014 so we need to make sure [employees] are empowered really quickly with all of the knowledge.\"\n\nThough the company officially began adding self-serve kiosks in stores in 2023, customers still prefer white-glove service. This improved training helps ensure that customers can get satisfying service as quickly as possible, even at busier locations \u2014 and it's one of the ways The UPS Store has stayed on top. This is the company's ninth year in a row in the Franchise 500's Top 10, and its 35th consecutive year as No. 1 in its category.\n\nUltimately, though, the new training system \u2014 which will continue to evolve in the coming year \u2014 is about more than just customer experience. It's part of the company's larger effort to better support franchisees. Another outcome of that effort: Its in-house franchise consultants used to serve 35 or more of The UPS Store locations each. Many of them are now averaging less than 30, to give them more time with each franchisee. \"We are supporting our franchisees to help them achieve their goals faster, so that they can support [their customers,] the small-business owners in their community,\" Casalan says. \"We're realigning all of our efforts around that, and I think that has made all the difference.\"\n\nRelated: Explore the full 2025 Franchise 500 list, complete with category rankings.",

The distillery is part of Luxco\u2019s branded portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe TTB ruling is a golden moment for American single malt,\u201d managing director of international business Greg Mefford said. \u201cIt\u2019s grabbed the attention of whisky enthusiasts around the world and is driving curiosity. We\u2019ve already seen a surge in interest in Yellowstone American Single Malt Whiskey since news of the ruling broke last month and expect awareness to grow as knowledge builds around the new category\u2019s official standards.\u201d\n\nGuidelines for American single malt will take effect starting 19 January. The regulations stipulate that to be labelled American single malt, a whiskey must be made from a fermented mash of 100% malted barely produced in the US; have a distillation proof of 160 [80% ABV or less]; be distilled at the same distillery in the US; be stored in used, charred new, or uncharred new oak barrels, with a 700-litre maximum capacity and only stored in the US; and have no neutral spirits, colouring, flavouring, or blending materials added with the exception of caramel colouring which must be disclosed on the label.\n\nLimestone Branch first released its Yellowstone single malt in early 2023. The whiskey complies with the newly established TTB standards. It is made from 100% malted barley, aged for four years in new charred oak, and bottled at 54% ABV.\n\n\u201cThe rich history of Scotch makes single malt one of the world\u2019s most renowned whisky styles, and any new take on this expression tends to create a reaction,\u201d Mefford added. \u201cIn this case, the drawn-out debate in recent years for establishing the American single malt category has fuelled greater interest. People want to know what all the fuss is about, and this is driving sales in the UK and Europe.\u201d\n\nLimestone Branch master distiller Stephen Beam is a descendant of the Beam and Dant whiskey families and sees the new regulations as a catalyst for innovation and quality standards.\n\n\u201cThe TTB\u2019s official provisions provide a positive framework for raising benchmarks and the ruling signals a new era for growing the category\u2019s popularity in well-established single malt whisky markets such as the UK, Germany, Italy and France,\u201d Beam said.\n\n\u201cThis official designation isn\u2019t about pitching American single malts against Scottish counterparts, or single malts from any other country for that matter. It\u2019s about appreciating another chapter in America\u2019s rich history of whiskey making and I think many people who are new to the category will be pleasantly surprised by what they find.\u201d\n\nRelated news\n\nZest for life: Label 5 Original Citrus\n\nGlengoyne takes White Oak range to US\n\nMijenta: Tequila sector must not 'hide' additive use",

            "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine United Parcel Service, Inc. ( ), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:\n\n34% = US$5.7b \u00f7 US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.34 in profit.\n\nDoes United Parcel Service Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, United Parcel Service has a better ROE than the average (8.9%) in the .\n\nThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for United Parcel Service by visiting our risks dashboard for free\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nUnited Parcel Service's Debt And Its 34% ROE\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by United Parcel Service, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.27. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this .\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

            "content": "According to the CEO of United Parcel Service (UPS 1.33%), the bottom is in. That's great news if you are looking for a turnaround stock. Add in UPS' attractive 5.2% dividend yield and there's even more to like about the shipping company's story. Here's why UPS could be the ultimate high-yield turnaround you can buy right now in the industrial space if you have $500, or more, to play with.\n\nWhat does UPS do?\n\nTo keep things simple, UPS is a shipping company. Its brown trucks and brown uniformed employees are recognizable on sight and are fairly ubiquitous in urban areas. The company's real strength lies in its logistics prowess, which allows it to quickly deliver packages from one place to another at a reasonable cost.\n\nThe package can be a one-off item, like a person sending a gift to a loved one, or bulk in nature, such as packages being sent out by a clothing company from a distribution center. It doesn't matter, UPS can get it on a truck or a plane and get it to where it needs to go.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020 investors got really excited by the prospects of increased online shopping. Indeed, more stuff bought online meant more stuff that needed to be shipped with a service like the one offered by UPS. However, in normal Wall Street fashion, investors got a little too excited by the story, pushing UPS' shares up dramatically in a very short period of time.\n\nIn 2022 that rally turned into a precipitous decline as the story didn't turn out to be as good as hoped. And UPS ran into some business issues that resulted in weak financial results. To add some color to that statement, earnings spiked at the end of 2020 and then started to trend lower.\n\nUPS might be at an at inflection point\n\nThat said, UPS CEO Carol Tome made a bold pronouncement along with the company's third quarter 2024 earnings release, \"On our last earnings call, we said that the second quarter would not only be the bottom, but a turning point for our performance, and that we would return to revenue and profit growth in the third quarter, which we did.\"\n\nSome numbers will help. Revenue rose 5.6% year over year in the third quarter of 2024. Operating profit jumped 22.8%. Operating margin increased 120 basis points, going from 7.7% in the third quarter of 2023 to 8.9% in the same stanza of 2024. And adjusted earnings per share rose 12.1%. Not bad at all, and if this is the start of an improving trend, investors could quickly fall back in love with UPS' stock.\n\nNothing goes in a straight line, so there's likely to be some bouncing around. In fact, UPS' business is a bit seasonal, given the importance of the holiday season when it comes to shopping and sending gifts. But if the bottom is in, or even nearly in, UPS' lofty yield (backed by 15 consecutive annual dividend increases) could be a great buy for long-term income investors.\n\nUPS: A high yield stock performing a low risk turnaround\n\nClearly the word \"ultimate\" is something that investors have to decide on themselves. However, it is hard to argue with a 5.2% dividend yield at a time when the market is yielding a scant 1.2%. Add in UPS' improving business fundamentals and you can see where turnaround investors might get excited here. All in, if you don't mind collecting a fat yield while you wait for the rest of Wall Street to catch on to the progress, you could easily attach the word ultimate to the UPS story today.",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Modular UPS Market by Technology, Phase Type, Voltage, Power Capacity, Form Factor, Battery Type - Global Forecast to 2030\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe modular UPS market will grow from USD 5.44 billion in 2024 to USD 9.52 billion by 2030 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% during the forecast period. Modular UPS systems are changing power management for IT, telecommunications, healthcare, and manufacturing industries. A modular UPS solution enables providers of critical infrastructures, such as IT firms, servers, storage systems, network devices, and cloud platforms, to ensure continuous business continuity and data security during power outages.\n\n\n\nThe adoption of modular UPS systems is growing because of operations' scalability, energy efficiency, and reliability. These systems allow businesses to adjust to changing power demand without difficulty while assuring future endurance and performance. Modular designs also enable speedy repairs and substitutions since an uninterrupted power supply would be established with very little disruption to operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy battery type, the lithium-ion batteries segment holds the highest CAGR during the forecast period.\n\n\n\nLithium-ion batteries are rechargeable power sources best known for their high energy density, long life, and fast charging. With their efficiency and compactness, these batteries are used in modern power backup systems. The rise of businesses and their increased dependency on power would now mean unbroken power supplies for mission-critical operations, and medical services would be at the center of such applications. Hence, lithium-ion batteries will undoubtedly meet the reliable backup for that industry's significant needs in terms of downtime disruptions.\n\n\n\nFor instance, modular UPS systems with lithium-ion batteries will ensure that uptime-critical operations affecting transaction processing, data storage, and customer services in data centers or financial institutions run consistently. These recharge faster and last longer than lead-acid batteries, reducing maintenance and downtime.\n\n\n\nA modular UPS design with lithium-ion batteries gives flexibility in increasing or reducing the power capacity of a business without a very expensive investment at the front. Their high energy density makes these lithium-ion batteries applicable in places lacking space as they provide a similar backup more compactly. Their operating efficiency in energy usage minimizes operation costs and stimulates the adoption of this technology, especially in healthcare, telecommunications, and IT. Companies would use modular UPS systems with lithium-ion batteries to ensure a reliable power backup solution, cost-saving in the long run, and the flexibility to augment it to support the expanding infrastructure.\n\n\n\nBased on end users, the industrial segment holds the largest market share during the forecast period.\n\n\n\nContinuous and reliable power supply is one of the key requirements for the industrial sector to run manufacturing processes smoothly, machinery safely, and critical systems optimally. Modular UPS systems are very effective, scalable, and efficient power protection solutions to unpredicted power outages, equipment failures, and power quality issues that can cause a shutdown.\n\n\n\nModular UPS is especially useful to users who require scaling of power protection in manufacturing, automotive, oil and gas, and chemical industries because they require such systems for continuity in production. Modular systems give the flexibility to scale power protection whenever needed without making any unnecessary commitments toward huge heavyweight systems from the beginning. Gradually, as demand rises for those systems, additional capacity is added without shutting down the production.\n\n\n\nThe modular structure of UPS units also makes maximum operational flexibility and redundancy possible, particularly in industrial surroundings. Modular UPS systems enable different equipment configurations, ranging from production line operation through the use of a control room and beyond automation systems, thus promoting a continuous power supply. Hot-swappable modules and N+X redundancy features minimize downtime and maximize productivity, even during maintenance or upgrades. In other words, with the increasing automation and interconnectivity within the industrial operations, the uninterrupted supply is going to be much more needed to operate critical machinery and IT infrastructure, where modular UPS helps in continuous operation.\n\n\n\nThe smart manufacturing process and Industry 4.0 have increased the demand for modular UPS systems in various industrial applications. These systems protect data loss or damage to equipment due to power interruptions. A modular approach guarantees that industries will be configured to current primary power requirements but will also accommodate the addition of advanced technologies into more traditional industrial processes, including robotics, sensors, and AI. Modular UPS systems are designed to be energy-efficient yet scalable and cost-efficient. Moreover, these modular systems would contribute to the general growth and innovation of the industrial sector, making them a worthy investment for businesses that intend to maintain their competitiveness and resilience.\n\n\n\nBased on the voltage, the medium voltage modular UPS(250-480V) segment holds the highest CAGR during the forecast period.\n\n\n\nMedium voltage modular UPS systems (from 250 to 480 V) are designed for power protection in medium-sized businesses and facilities in the best capacity and flexibility. Applications for these systems are typically related to mid-sized data centers, healthcare facilities, educational institutions, and light industry plants. Usually, they are applied for powering operations that require robust, scalable, and energy-efficient power solutions that are reliable in the continuity of critical processes.\n\n\n\nThe medium voltage modular UPS systems are scalable, allowing businesses to scale their power capacity incrementally by adding modules to address changing needs without changing the entire system, thereby saving costs and being flexible over time. It usually comes with advanced technologies like a high-efficiency rectifier and inverter to improve energy performance and lower operating costs. The modular design has also made it easier to maintain the system with less downtime because units can be serviced and replaced without affecting the overall system.\n\n\n\nMedium voltage UPS systems are generally known for their dependability and safeguarding critical infrastructure from power interruptions. Such UPS systems offer uninterruptible services in case of any power failure, sudden changes in voltage, or surges, which guarantees that critical, reliable operations can be run under a high level of disturbance.

Lane will be based in Houston, and will succeed Al Williams, who will retire in April after 34 years at the company, according to a Chevron statement.\n\nLane will oversee Chevron\u2019s government affairs, communications and social investment activities.\n\n\"Chevron is all about safely powering human progress, and I\u2019m thrilled to lead its corporate affairs function to help deliver on that commitment at this consequential time,\" said Lane, in an emailed statement. \"I am especially proud to be joining this innovative company, with its focus on delivering reliable, affordable and ever-cleaner energy in an increasingly complex global environment.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Lane was EVP and chief corporate affairs and sustainability officer at UPS. She left that position in September and was not replaced.\n\nLane joined UPS in 2011 as president of global public affairs and held various roles during her 13 years at the company. She had served in her most recent position since 2020, overseeing public policy and government affairs, PR, employee communications and The UPS Foundation. Lane was a member of the company\u2019s executive leadership team, reporting to CEO Carol Tom\u00e9.\n\nBefore joining UPS, Lane was MD and head of international government affairs at Citigroup and VP of global public policy at Time Warner. She also served in the U.S. Foreign Service for seven years.\n\nLane has been honored in PRWeek\u2019s Women of Distinction program and on PRWeek\u2019s Power List.\n\nSean McCormack, who joined Chevron as VP of communications in 2022, will report to Lane, a spokesperson said.\n\nIn Q3 2024, Chevron reported revenue of $50.7 billion, declining 6% from the previous year. The company\u2019s net income in the quarter was $4.5 billion, down 31% year-over-year. Chevron is scheduled to report its Q4 and full-year 2024 earnings on January 31.\n\nLast week, a Chevron spokesperson said the company will donate to President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund.\n\n\u201cChevron has a long tradition of celebrating democracy by supporting the inaugural committees of both parties. We are proud to be doing so again this year,\" spokesperson Bill Turenne told Reuters.",

            "content": "United Parcel Service, Inc. UPS is a global logistics and package delivery service leader. With a market cap of $105.2 billion, it is dedicated to providing innovative and efficient supply chain solutions, connecting businesses and consumers across more than 220 countries and territories. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Feb. 4.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect UPS to report a profit of $2.52 per share, up 2% from $2.47 in the year-ago quarter. The company has surpassed Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion. Its adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share for the last quarter surpassed the consensus estimate by 6.7%. UPS' Q3 beat was driven by rebounding U.S. volumes, cost controls, and new USPS air cargo business.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect UPS to report EPS of $7.49, down 14.7% from $8.78 in fiscal 2023. However, the company is expected to rebound in fiscal 2025 with a 16.7% year-over-year growth, reaching an EPS of $8.74.\n\nUnited Parcel's shares have dropped 23.5% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming the S&P 500 Index's XLI 16.9% return in the same period.\n\nUPS has lagged behind the broader market and peers, pressured by concerns over rising transportation costs and growing competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s strategic investments in technology and infrastructure aim to boost efficiency and competitiveness. On Oct. 24, UPS shares jumped over 5% following a Q3 earnings report that exceeded expectations. Consolidated revenues rose 5.6% year-over-year to $22.2 billion. Additionally, UPS revised its 2024 outlook, projecting $91.1 billion in revenue and a 9.6% non-GAAP adjusted operating margin, incorporating Q3 performance and the Coyote Logistics divestiture.\n\nThe consensus opinion on UPS stock is moderately bullish, with an overall \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating. Of 26 analysts covering the stock, 16 advise a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, eight suggest a \u201cHold,\u201d and two suggest a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d UPS' average analyst price target is $148.03, indicating a 20.1% potential upside from the current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rashmi Kumari did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

I thought it was very well done. What do you think?\n\nAnd, rather than be completely disengaged from my physical reality, I will acknowledge that I\u2019m currently in a hotel room, but not Excelsior/Davey-style. I came here, with my child and all my journals and photo albums, to flee the smoke and fires. And then I got quite sick, I have Covid. It\u2019s been completely surreal to have a fever in this context, without things like a tea kettle. Nothing like my friends who lost everything, just difficult timing.\n\nI don\u2019t think these group chats are unrelated to our collective survival. The same women with whom I discuss relationships, sex and freedom I am now texting about air quality and shock and practical plans for getting though this (as well as unrelated topics: Are we allowed to talk about other things? asks my Jordi, who doesn\u2019t know if her house is still standing. Yes, we must or we\u2019ll go crazy.) Our ability to know what we need and act upon it remains fuzzy, obscure, hard to pull into focus \u2014 until we talk candidly with each other. Numbness and paralysis flourish in isolation, and meanwhile there is real joy and comfort (and such power) in our conversations. I feel dim-witted, blunted by illness and stress, but I suppose I\u2019m posting anyway to draw upon this comfort, charge myself up for the challenges of a daunting day. xxx Stay safe.",

This development is expected to improve retail search, sponsored ads performance, and overall Amazon optimization.\n\nOn Wednesday, OMG revealed a partnership with TikTok that builds upon their previous work in influencer identification and TikTok shop management. The new capability allows search keywords from TikTok to inform influencer content.\n\nRoku co-development enriches audience data\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement featured a co-development with Roku that enables the enrichment of first-party or Omni audiences with search data. Pagliuca emphasized the importance of leaning into \u201cwalled garden\u201d ecosystems to provide data enrichment, as exemplified by their previous partnership with Uber and now with Roku.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of our competitors may not have looked at these walled gardens as areas where their data is walled off, where we\u2019ve really leaned in to be able to provide data enrichment,\u201d she noted.\n\nYou\u2019re watching \u201cCommerce Media Summit at CES 2025\u201d, a Beet.TV Leadership Series with Omnicom Media Group.

Raymond and Larkin have 17 goals, and DeBrincat has 18; all in 41 games.\n\nLucas Raymond has ended up the principal playmaker for the Wings; having 44 points in 41 games, 27 of those being assists; a team-leading tally.\n\nThe Red Wings have a terrifying power play; being 3rd in the entire league in Power Play-% with a 27.3%. However, that power play is tempered by having one of the worst penalty kills in the entire league; with only a 69.4% success rate.\n\nThe Wings have been using Alex Lyon and Cam Talbot for their netminders, and both have been enormously mercurial. Both are sitting at or around .901 SV%. Talbot has more starts with 20.\n\nGame Preview\n\nThe Kraken finally broke an agonizing streak of lost games against the Buffalo Sabres by never giving up even after playing a pretty poor first period. They got multiple 2 point nights out of their roster and had a solid rebound performance from Joey Daccord!\n\nThat said, they need to keep that up coming into today; because Detroit is not to be trifled with right now.\n\nThe East\u2019s wildcard picture is rapidly clumping up with teams who have anywhere from 47 to 42 points, and while Detroit is well behind a lot of their compatriots, they\u2019re charging up the standings pretty quickly and on a 6 game winning streak; most recently against the Blackhawks, Senators, and the Winnipeg Jets. They\u2019ve leaned into their north-south game as a devastating weapon against their foes, and even if they give up a goal or two (and their goalies will do that), they will happily turn straight up ice and try to get it back.\n\nThe Kraken need to take advantage of 2 things: one, the Red Wings are perfectly comfortable giving up shots, and that atrocious Detroit penalty kill. The Kraken power play isn\u2019t exactly a world-killer, but the PK of the Wings is so bad that it would be almost criminal not to get at least a couple goals from the experience. They also need to hammer Lyon/Talbot in tight, as neither of them are especially great with the puck in the slot and high slot. If they can do that, there\u2019s a chance we can take one win, and make it two. They just need to keep the pace from the last two periods of hockey they played going.\n\nLET\u2019S GO KRAKEN",

He has been charged to stop them for Inter Miami CF. He was good enough to be called up to the USMNT for the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup and the 2024 January camp. The Sacramento, Calif. native did not see any action, but being with the squad was a learning experience and a half for the 27-year-old Callender, who was named Miami's 2023 defensive player of the year. In 2024, Callender backstopped Miami's run to the MLS Supporters' Shield, making 104 saves and allowing 45 goals in 32 games, recording five shutouts. One of his finest moments was in the 2023 Leagues Cup final against Nashville SC, when the 6-3, 194-lb. keeper converted a penalty kick in the shootout and saved the last PK to give Miami its first trophy. Callender played at the University of California, Berkeley, where he registered 16 shutouts in 54 contests. Miami acquired his Homegrown Player rights from the San Jose Earthquakes in December 2019.\n\nMatt Freese - New York City FC\n\nAfter enjoying a breakout year in 2024, Matt Freese received his second call-up to the national team this January. The 26-year-old goalie was outstanding in net last year, establishing himself as one of the best in MLS. For his efforts, he was named New York City FC's team MVP. After four seasons as an understudy to Philadelphia Union and Jamaica international keeper Andre Blake, Freese received his big break when he was traded to NYCFC in 2023. The Wayne, Pa. native allowed eight goals in 10 games while accumulating five clean sheets. As the No. 1 choice last season, Freese was outstanding, starting all 34 matches and recording six shutouts. He played a major role in City reaching the Eastern Conference semifinals, as he was named Player of the Match after a superb performance against favored FC Cincinnati in the final first round game. He made several vital saves in a scoreless draw in regulation before producing three more in a 6-5 shootout win.\n\nDEFENDERS\n\nMax Arfsten - Columbus Crew\n\nIn his second season with the Columbus Crew, Max Arfsten did not suffer a sophomore jinx. In fact, he grew into his position as a wingback, connecting for four goals and eight assists over 27 starts and 30 regular season games as the Crew captured the Leagues Cup crown. The 6-1, 172-lb. Arsten, who is known for his tireless work rate, started his MLS career with a bang in 2023, coming off the bench to score in his debut in a 6-1 victory over Atlanta United. The 21-year-old went on to finish his rookie season with two goals and two assists in a dozen contests. In the MLS Cup Playoffs, Arfsten continued to be a thorn in Atlanta's side, scoring his first postseason goal in a 4-2 first-round loss. He played three seasons at the University of California, Davis, earning Big West Offensive of the Year honors in 2021 before turning pro. The Fresno, Calif. native performed with San Jose Earthquakes II, scoring nine times in 24 matches. He was selected by the Crew as the 14th overall pick in the 2023 MLS SuperDraft.\n\nGeorge Campbell - CF Montr\u00e9al\n\nAfter he was traded by Atlanta United to CF Montr\u00e9al for General Allocation Money two years ago, George Campbell has become a regular on the backline. He has combined his physicality and aerial dominance to thwart potential goal-scorers. In 2023, the 6-2, 185-lb. defender made 21 starts over 26 matches, scoring once and assisting once. He added three assists in 28 matches and 25 starts in 2024. Atlanta United signed Campbell as its sixth Homegrown Player in 2019. The 23-year-old was previously called up to the U.S. Under-23 national camp for friendlies in March 2024, and played twice for U-20 national squad.\n\nMIDFIELDERS\n\nEmeka Eneli - Real Salt Lake\n\nEmeka Eneli is coming off an impressive second season with Real Salt Lake, as his teammates voted him the team's MVP. He was their iron man, starting 35 of 38 matches across all competitions. The Lansing, Mich. native became a valuable link in the middle of the field, receiving the ball under pressure with the ability to quickly move it to a teammate. Eneli made his MLS debut in a 4-0 home defeat to St. Louis CITY SC on March 25, 2023. He scored his lone regular-season goal in a 2-1 loss to the Colorado Rapids on March 9, 2024. The 5-9 midfielder also tallied RSL's lone playoff goal in the opening round against Minnesota United. Eneli had outstanding career at Cornell University as he captained the squad for two seasons, while earning second team All-American honors and helping the team reach the NCAA Division I Sweet Sixteen for the first time in almost three decades. He contributed 20 goals and 17 assists, before graduating with a biological engineering degree. Eneli was selected by RSL as the 25th overall choice in the 2023 MLS SuperDraft.\n\nFORWARDS\n\nPatrick Agyemang - Charlotte FC\n\nAfter getting his feet wet as an MLS rookie in 2023, Patrick Agyemang had a breakout season with Charlotte FC last year. He scored a team-high 10 goals and added five assists, good for third on the squad. Agyemang is a rarity, having started his college career at Eastern Connecticut State University, a Division III school, where he netted 30 goals and added 10 assists in two seasons. He also earned Division III All-America honors and was named Little East Conference player of the year as a sophomore. He transferred to the University of Rhode Island (Division I), where he connected for 19 goals and 12 assists in his final two seasons and wound up on the MAC Hermann Award Watch List. After the East Hartford, Conn. native was selected by Charlotte FC as the 12th overall selection of the 2023 MLS SuperDraft, the 6-4 Agyemang scored 10 goals in only a dozen matches for Crown Legacy FC (MLS NEXT Pro) while seeing the field in 12 games. He played 182 minutes for the MLS club. Agyemang is trying to become the first URI player since Geoff Cameron to play for the USMNT.\n\nCaden Clark - CF Montr\u00e9al\n\nThis is Caden Clark's second USMNT call-up after previously being with the team as an unused substitute during a 1-0 U.S. victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina on Dec. 19, 2021. As a 17-year-old, Clark enjoyed an auspicious MLS debut. On the same day that the New York Red Bulls acquired his rights, he scored the lone goal in a 1-0 victory over host Atlanta United on Oct. 10, 2020. He finished his short season with two goals in seven matches. In 2021, the 5-11, 161-lb. attacking midfielder was loaned to RB Leipzig but did not make an appearance for the Bundesliga club. In 2022, the Medina, Minn. native was loaned to Vendsyssel FF (Denmark) before he was traded to Minnesota United the next season. Late in the 2024 season, he was dealt to CF Montr\u00e9al, where he found the net four times in nine matches while setting up four goals. Now 21, Clark was a member of the U.S. team that won the 2022 Under-20 Concacaf Championship, which helped the USA qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He scored three goals in 12 contests for the U-20 squad.\n\nBrian Guti\u00e9rrez - Chicago Fire\n\nHe may be only 21, but Brian Guti\u00e9rrez already has 120 MLS matches, 80 starts, 10 goals and 20 assists under his belt. Over the last three seasons, the 5-10, 141-lb. Guti\u00e9rrez has become a mainstay in the Fire midfield. He has been productive in each season, totaling two goals and seven assists in 2022, two goals and a team-high nine assists in 2023 and six goals and three assists last season. He was named Fire\u2019s team MVP in 2023. Born in Berwyn, Ill., Guti\u00e9rrez has been with the Fire organization for a decade, after joining the club's youth academy in 2015. He signed with the team as a Homegrown player in 2020. He has experience playing for the USA with the U-16, U-20 and U-23 squads.\n\nMatko Miljevic - Unattached\n\nAs of Jan. 1, Miljevic is without a team after leaving Newell's Old Boys in Argentina. Born in Miami, Fla., the 23-year-old Miljevic started his career with Argentinos Juniors in 2018, scoring once in six appearances over four seasons with the first team. He signed with CF Montr\u00e9al in 2021, where he found the net twice in 35 matches through the 2023 campaign. Miljevic is eligible to play for Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and the United States at international level. The 5-7 Miljevic played with the U.S. U-16 and U-20 teams, as well as Argentina's U-18 and U-20 squads.\n\nIndiana Vassilev - St. Louis CITY SC\n\nPutting on a U.S. shirt certainly won't be anything new for Vassilev, as he has represented his country at the U-17, U-18, U-20, and U-23 levels. He has played overseas with Aston Villa's U-23 team, where he scored four goals in his first six matches of the 2019-20 Premier League 2 season. The Savannah, Ga. Native made his English Premier League debut as a reserve in a 1-1 draw at Brighton & Hove Albion on Jan. 18, 2020. Vassilev, 23, also played on loan with English Football League teams Cheltenham Town and Burton Albion, winning the 2020\u201321 League Two title with the former. While on loan with Inter Miami CF in 2021, the 5-8, 159-lb. forward tallied his first MLS goal, a stoppage-time game-winner against Nashville on Aug. 8, 2021. St. Louis CITY selected Vassilev in the 2022 expansion draft, and a permanent transfer from Aston Villa was reached in 2023. He became a regular, recording two goals and five assists in 34 appearances in 2023 and three goals and four assists in 29 games in 2024.",

JPMorgan says the issue is gaining attention of investors but it has not seen any official commentary from UPS. It expects UPS will walk through the strategic rational and financial implications on the Q4 earnings call on January 30. Overall, JPMorgan views the move as a long term positive for parcel pricing as well as UPS, but says notes it is unsure how well prepared the network is to in-source SurePost volume immediately after peak season considering FedEx originally estimated its transition of a similar service would take roughly a year.\n\nStay Ahead of the Market:\n\nDiscover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener\n\nPublished first on TheFly \u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

            "content": "New York: People who have limited access to air conditioning may be at higher risk of seeking emergency care for health problems following exposure to wildfire smoke, according to a new study led by Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) in the US, as Los Angeles County battles the most destructive wildfires in its history.\n\nThe study suggested that US policies should prioritise equity and education regarding the measures people can take to protect themselves from the harmful pollutants in wildfire smoke.\n\nPosted online ahead of publication in the journal Environmental Research: Health, the study found that exposure to fine particle matter (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke in California is associated with higher rates of emergency department visits for all causes, non-accidental causes, and respiratory disease.\n\nThis risk varied by age and race, but was especially high for individuals who lived in areas with lower availability of air conditioning.\n\n\u201cDepending on the type of system and filter used, air conditioning may modify the impact of smoke exposure on human health,\u201d said study lead and corresponding author Dr. Jennifer Stowell, research scientist in climate and health at BUSPH.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is, perhaps, the best example of this in the US, with bigger fires and longer fire seasons. An important next step will be to identify ways to better characterise access to air conditioning,\u201d Stowell added.\n\nThe findings come at a critical time as firefighters in Southern California continue to battle multiple wildfires that have been blazing in and around Los Angeles County since Tuesday (January 7) \u2014 including the Palisades fire, which is likely the largest and most destructive wildfire in the county\u2019s history.\n\nHealth experts are urging residents who are not under evacuation orders and can safely remain in their homes to turn on air conditioners and/or air purifiers if they have access to these devices.\n\nDespite this guidance, very little research has examined how the health effects of wildfire smoke exposure may differ based on individuals\u2019 access to air conditioning.\n\nFor the study, Dr Stowell and colleagues from BUSPH, Boston University College of Arts & Sciences (CAS), and the Health Effects Institute utilised a nationwide dataset of healthcare claims to assess more than 50,000 emergency department visits during the 2012-2019 California wildfire seasons, which occurred from May to November each year.\n\nPeople living in areas with lower availability of air conditioning had a 22-per cent greater risk of visiting the emergency department for respiratory conditions associated with wildfire smoke exposure.\n\nThe study indicates a need for stronger policy measures that can reduce the health risks associated with wildfire smoke exposure.\n\n(IANS)",

Ironing out some wrinkles was always going to be necessary though.\n\nNow for the good news.\n\nThis week's show was a much improved watch from beginning to end. Sure, familiar WWE tropes like stretching out entrances (those entrance > ad break > recap package > entrance sequences are a little painful when watching live) remain, but several lengthy matches and increased emphasis on some of the midcard pack definitely helped soothe that. At times, SmackDown was the show Raw's Netflix debut should've been.\n\nJacob Fatu looked every bit a WWE headliner in the making, Tiffany found out who her first title challenger is, Kevin Owens continued being the bane of Cody Rhodes' life, and a pair of surprisingly slick tag-team bouts added loads to the night. When was the last time anyone could say that about Los Garza or A-Town Down Under?!\n\nElsewhere, Paul Heyman declared Roman Reigns for the 2025 Royal Rumble, LA Knight battled Shinsuke Nakamura for the United States Title, and Chelsea Green...badly needs to move on.

On Day 2, I had dinner, and with a few minutes to spare before my eating window closed, I decided to cram in dessert while I still could. As a result, I was uncomfortably full, and reminded that this was how I sabotaged every effort to become healthy. I followed the letter of the law, but not the spirit. My self-sabotaging mind automatically looked for ways to bend the rules just up to the breaking point. So on Day 3, I didn\u2019t quite have the pep in my step that empty bowels and the smugness of two whole days of habit-following could give you.\n\nThe other problem was that I was still drinking my 4th cup of green tea at 3:00 p.m., which kept me from sleeping. Even less pep. Lessons learned!\n\nHabit 3: pull ups\n\nMy third chosen habit was pull ups. Or, more accurately, pull up. I could do only one at that point, but perhaps by starting this habit, I would be able to double that number by Day 30, maybe even triple it. I had a pull up bar outside \u2013 the vestiges of a partially-dismantled jungle gym \u2013 so the plan was to stop by on my way in or out of the house every day to do as many pull ups (or pull up) as I could.\n\nSince my first two habits centered on diet, it was time to incorporate exercise.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nUPS SurePost packages are now being delivered by UPS drivers only, rather than a large portion of those parcels going to the U.S. Postal Service, a Teamsters union spokesperson told Supply Chain Dive.\n\n\"Millions of packages moved away from SurePost and the United States Postal Service and returned to UPS package cars this month, now being sorted and delivered by hardworking UPS Teamsters,\" the union said in a Facebook post on Tuesday.\n\nUPS did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the Teamsters' claims of SurePost changes. However, SurePost information on UPS' website, including product features and how deliveries are made, no longer mentions the Postal Service. Previous versions of those overviews highlighted how SurePost leveraged the agency, including for PO Boxes and addresses outside the contiguous U.S.\n\nUPS SurePost's listed capabilities have changed Formerly listed Currently listed Last-mile delivery provider U.S. Postal Service, UPS UPS Coverage U.S. 48 contiguous states, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, all U.S. Territories, PO Boxes and Military APO / FPO Destinations U.S. 48 contiguous states Transit time Estimated 2 to 7 days within the contiguous U.S., longer for other destinations Estimated 2 to 6 days\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSurePost is one of many delivery services in the market that have relied on the Postal Service's robust final-mile network for cost-effective shipping. Shipping partners like UPS would drop off packages at Postal Service facilities closest to the end customer, rather than delivering themselves.\n\nTimes are changing. UPS-employed drivers have been taking on a larger share of SurePost volume under the Teamsters' current contract agreement with the company. Meanwhile, the Postal Service is pushing consolidators to bring packages further upstream in its network through new contracts that eliminate rate discounts for delivery unit dropoff.\n\nWhen asked about the Postal Service's current role in SurePost deliveries, a USPS spokesperson said in a statement that \"some businesses negotiated new agreements with us, and some have not.\"\n\n\"Prior agreements failed to reflect operational and financial realities, the evolving postal network, or the enhancements to our portfolio of product offerings,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nNot having the Postal Service as a SurePost partner means UPS has to figure out the best way to deliver millions of additional packages cost-effectively within a more streamlined network. The carrier has been slashing capacity and closing several facilities under its \"Network of the Future\" initiative.\n\nUsing the Postal Service helped keep SurePost pricing low, as UPS could avoid making more expensive deliveries to far-flung and rural destinations themselves, Tony Runyan, chief client officer at Red Stag Fulfillment, said in an interview. Now, UPS is likely to increase fees for packages going to these destinations, he added. Last month, the carrier announced it was planning rate and surcharge increases for SurePost effective Jan. 13.\n\nRunyan said SurePost could eventually evolve into a similar offering as FedEx Ground Economy, which formerly relied on the Postal Service for final-mile delivery under the \"FedEx SmartPost\" name.\n\n\"I think that's probably where it's headed, where you're going to wind up paying more than you were for SurePost but not as much as [UPS] Ground, and it's essentially not going to get the priority that Ground gets when it goes to delivery,\" Runyan said.",

The service has been a hit with e-commerce companies and other customers valuing price over speed.\n\nAnd while SurePost remains, there are questions about whether the Post Office is still involved. On Jan. 7, the Teamsters union representing UPS employees said on social media that \"millions of packages moved away from SurePost and the United States Postal Service and returned to UPS package cars this month, now being sorted and delivered by hardworking UPS Teamsters.\"\n\nWhile moving things in-house should be a long-term positive for pricing, it could create near-term uncertainty. Rival FedEx estimated it would take about a year to make a similar transition.\n\nIs UPS a buy in 2025?\n\nThe company isn't talking about SurePost right now, but it is likely analysts will be asking questions about the program and the financial implications of a shift on UPS's planned Jan. 30 post-earnings call.\n\nAfter years chasing volumes as e-commerce soared, both UPS and FedEx are refocusing their businesses around profitability and looking for ways to generate higher margins.

            "content": "In response, shippers are diversifying their carrier bases and continuing to adjust and adapt their supply chain operating strategies, with a hard focus on how and when parcel shipments are delivered and by whom.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at more regional providers for better rates and service,\u201d De Muynck observes. \u201cWith new players coming into the market, especially in the last mile, that has created a lot more options for shippers.\u201d That in itself is making parcel planning and management a much more difficult and complex endeavor, he adds. \u201cAnd that means you need more technology to manage multiple providers effectively.\u201d\n\nTURBULENT TIMES\n\nThe parcel shipping market is undergoing an evolution that is fundamentally changing the structural foundation of the business, observes Satish Jindel, principal at ShipMatrix, a consulting firm that provides parcel data and analytics.\n\n\u201cWe are in the most turbulent time people have seen in the last 40 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe competition [that the major parcel carriers] are facing is unlike anything they have faced before. So they\u2019re struggling to figure out who the competitors are, how [those competitors] will affect them, and how they need to respond.\u201d\n\nAmong the competitive challenges: the surging growth of Amazon\u2019s own parcel and small-package delivery business, and competition from big retailers like Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, and Target, which have launched their own last-mile delivery services, fulfilling e-commerce orders directly from retail stores for delivery to local customers.\n\nThen there are crowdsourced last-mile delivery services like DoorDash and Roadie, which contract with drivers in their own vehicles to make local same-day deliveries for a wide range of businesses. And not to be forgotten are the regional parcel carriers like OnTrac (formerly LaserShip), which operate off lower cost bases and are expanding their coverage, as well as hyperlocal delivery firms that focus exclusively on an individual metro area.\n\nAll these developments come in response to the demands of consumers who continue to fuel modest growth in retail spending\u2014a consistent share of that, roughly 16%, represented by e-commerce sales\u2014and the reality that short-distance home delivery of just about anything is here to stay. And that growth opportunity is enticing more players to jump into the BtoC last-mile market.\n\nTRADING DOWN\n\nShippers and third-party logistics service providers (3PLs) are employing a laundry list of strategies and tactics as they try to rein in rising parcel shipping costs. At the same time, they are reworking the menu of e-commerce shipping options they offer to consumers, who are increasingly forgoing next-day delivery in favor of slower, deferred service if it will save them money\u2014and help the environment.\n\nMicheal McDonagh is president of parcel services at 3PL AFS Logistics. He, for one, wonders how long the big parcel carriers can keep raising prices (and surcharges) before it becomes untenable and begins eroding their customer base.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing for me with UPS and FedEx is how do they expect to keep customers, with the increases [and surcharges] they are [imposing]?\u201d he says. \u201cTheir price increases are forcing shippers to look at other alternatives. Plus, they are generally less flexible about when they will take your parcels. They are more rigid with their cutoff times, and [their deadlines] are typically earlier than what some regional carriers will offer.\u201d\n\nMcDonagh estimates that with the large parcel carriers, parcel transport costs have increased 33% in the past five years.\n\nSuch rate jumps are increasingly difficult for shippers to absorb, McDonagh says, especially when shippers typically set their budgets at the start of the year, only to get hit \u201cin the last quarter [by] a raft of surcharges and zone changes they didn\u2019t plan for.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s driving two trends among shippers and the 3PLs like AFS who manage freight and parcel transportation for their customers.\n\n\u201cWe are telling our customers to look at the U.S. Postal Service as an option,\u201d McDonagh says. While the Postal Service may not be as quick, \u201c[it is] cheaper,\u201d he notes, adding that shippers are making that tradeoff to save money. He believes that the USPS is the nation\u2019s largest parcel carrier, handling an estimated 6.6 billion packages annually. By his accounting, UPS handles 4.6 billion and FedEx 3.9 billion.\n\nThe other trend is shippers \u201ctrading down\u201d in service selection. \u201cShippers are reacting to the high cost of premium services and moving freight into the lower-cost \u2026 deferred ground services,\u201d he notes. In addition, many retailers have curtailed the practice of offering free shipping for every e-commerce order, instead setting minimum order levels to qualify for free shipping or only offering free shipping for deferred two- or three-day service so the package can go via ground. For parcel carriers, this trend means that shipments moving via premium next-day service\u2014which provide more revenue and higher margins\u2014are being replaced with lower-revenue shipments.\n\nShippers are also reimagining their shipping practices\u2014instead of shipping small lots every day, they\u2019re consolidating shipments and dropping them with carriers once or twice a week. That tactic helps the shipper negotiate lower rates with the carriers, who are not making as many stops to pick up parcels.\n\n\u201cIf you can mode-shift to slower services like the Postal Service or economy ground, you will save money,\u201d says McDonagh.\n\nHe also cites opportunities for shippers to reduce costs by examining how they package and box orders. Parcel shipments often arrive in a box that\u2019s larger than necessary and contains excessive amounts of filler material. \u201cHow much are you paying to ship air, and what\u2019s the cost of that unused space?\u201d McDonagh asks. Among other things, the need to eliminate wasted space has led to the growth of automated packaging systems that will scan the product as it comes down the line and then custom build a box to that product\u2019s dimensions.\n\nOFFERING CHOICES\n\nChris Kina, senior director and analyst, logistics, customer fulfillment, and network design for the consulting and advisory firm Gartner, has spent 30 years as a logistics practitioner, working for Gillette, Procter & Gamble, and KB Toys before joining Gartner three years ago. In his conversations with logistics executives, Kina has detected a shift in strategies in response to today\u2019s market. \u201cWe are seeing clients begin to look more and more at segmentation of their last-mile provider networks ... by region, by state, by metro area,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question they are asking is, \u2018Who can meet my service expectations at the lowest cost?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a trend driven by increasingly powerful, sophisticated, and capable technology platforms. These systems are designed to handle everything from order management and inventory visibility, to shipment and delivery route optimization, to shipment enroute visibility on the delivery side, to customer feedback. And virtually all communications between the shipper, delivery driver, and customer take place via smartphone.\n\n\u201cThese advanced technologies [and the real-time nature of their functionality] are the key to making it all work in this new environment,\u201d he says.\n\nBart De Muynck agrees with Kina\u2019s observation, sharing one example of a new technology that\u2019s rising to the challenge of a more complex and fragmented parcel market. De Muynck points to Shipium, a company launched by Amazon alum Jason Murray. According to De Muynck, Murray is building an Amazon-like platform for parcel optimization and carrier management\u2014and is targeting as customers businesses that ship dozens to thousands of parcels a day from many locations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s parcel optimization that provides for the most efficient allocation of freight from many locations across multiple carriers,\u201d by examining the requirements of a shipment, then looking at the broader carrier network to find the best combination of service and price, he says.\n\nThe platform also allows the shipper to model its parcel volumes against its carrier network to develop an optimized price/service tactical plan for shipping. \u201cIt is reducing [parcel shipping costs] by as much as 20%,\u201d De Muynck adds.\n\nGartner\u2019s Kina also emphasizes how parcel shippers and managed transportation providers are deploying various tactical and strategic developments that add flexibility and options as shippers figure out the best delivery models for their business.\n\nThose include the use of small electric vans or bicycles for inner-city deliveries; locker systems at convenient retail sites, which serve as consolidated dropoff locations and customer pickup points, versus a truck making a residential stop; and cloud-based route optimization models and other tools, all of which \u201cmaximize the ability to select, manage, and deploy multiple forms of sources for delivery carriers,\u201d Kina notes.\n\nWhere is the market headed? In Kina\u2019s view, \u201cfive years from now, the U.S. market will have more of a European flavor \u2026. [It will be] much more fragmented around regional and local carriers, crowdsourcing [services], and technology solutions that help make deliveries of BtoB and BtoC shipments more efficient.\u201d\n\nAnother rising trend: Consumers, concerned about cost and sustainability, are seeking more choices, opting for deferred deliveries and consolidating their e-commerce purchases into a single large delivery on a designated day of the week\u2014which Amazon is already doing.\n\n\u201cAssuming everyone wants their shipment the next day is not a viable business strategy for any shipper,\u201d Kina says. \u201cConsumers will typically accept delivery in three days as long as you \u2026 are consistent with it. If they want expedited, they will [specify] that and often pay for it.\u201d\n\nPLAYING THE LONG GAME\n\nMany sources interviewed for this story shared their intentions to move away from putting all their parcels in one or two big carrier buckets, instead seeking to diversify their carrier base to improve service, gain flexibility, and better control rising costs.\n\nYet that\u2019s not a strategy for everyone.\n\n\u201cWe play the long game,\u201d says John Janson, vice president of global logistics at SanMar, the nation\u2019s largest provider of branded promotional apparel. \u201cWe set a carefully crafted strategy and stick with it. We don\u2019t put out a bid and change it from one year to the next. We develop and nurture strategic relationships with our core carriers, and we lean on those,\u201d he says.\n\nSanMar, which ships almost exclusively to businesses, deploys a supply chain featuring 13 distribution centers across the U.S., which, during this year\u2019s peak season, will ship over 100,000 packages nightly. UPS is SanMar\u2019s principal parcel carrier.\n\nFor Janson, one philosophy he\u2019s never wavered from is being a shipper of choice. \u201cI believe there is still currency around being a desired shipper, making our freight as attractive as possible to the carrier,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cIt\u2019s easy when times are bad, but it pays dividends [when capacity is tight]. It\u2019s an investment in our carrier partners and [in] ensuring we get the quality of service our customers demand.\u201d\n\nHe agrees with Jindel and others that in the parcel industry, \u201cthere is more dynamic change happening right now than at any time in recent history.\u201d And the BtoC last-mile home delivery market\u2014as opposed to the BtoB arena, where SanMar generally plays\u2014is seeing the most significant change, he adds, noting that \u201cthere are some really interesting developments on the horizon.\u201d\n\nHe points to how Walmart has teamed up with The Home Depot on its \u201cGoLocal\u201d delivery-as-a-service business, giving Home Depot customers (and others) another option for same-day or next-day last-mile delivery. And as more retailers take Walmart up on its offer, that will help build more density in that network, reducing per-package costs and providing more revenue opportunity for the network\u2019s delivery drivers.\n\nThen there is Amazon, which Janson notes is also offering third parties access to its logistics services and parcel delivery network.\n\nEssentially, Amazon\u2019s pitch is \u201cLet us deliver all your packages,\u201d not just those generated as an Amazon reseller, he says. And while the pitch may sound enticing, Janson offers a word of caution. \u201cDo you want Amazon to have access to all your final-mile delivery customers? And if you are using Amazon as a reseller and a logistics provider, how deep [do you really want that relationship to go]? I think it\u2019s a risk.\u201d",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Data Center UPS Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2019-2029F\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Data Center UPS Market was valued at USD 5.42 Billion in 2023, and is expected to reach USD 8.53 Billion by 2029, rising at a CAGR of 7.85%\n\nThe primary function of a Data Center UPS is to supply power during an interruption in the main power source, allowing the data center to either switch to an alternative power source or shut down systems in a controlled manner. This system typically includes batteries, inverters, and other electrical components that store energy and release it when necessary. With the rise of cloud computing, big data, and the increasing reliance on online services, the need for data centers has skyrocketed, consequently driving the demand for robust and efficient power protection systems like Data Center UPS.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs organizations continue to rely heavily on data centers to handle vast amounts of information and support critical operations, the risk of power disruptions becomes more significant, thus amplifying the need for UPS systems to ensure uninterrupted power supply and mitigate any potential damage. The growing shift towards digitalization, e-commerce, and the Internet of Things has led to a rise in the volume of data processed and stored in these facilities, increasing the dependence on power backup solutions. As the energy efficiency and performance of UPS systems improve, companies are increasingly investing in these technologies to reduce energy consumption and improve the overall reliability of their data centers.\n\n\n\nThe market for Data Center UPS is also experiencing growth due to the expansion of the renewable energy sector, which requires hybrid systems that integrate both traditional and renewable power sources. In addition, advancements in technology have led to the development of more compact and scalable UPS solutions, making it easier for businesses of all sizes to adopt these systems.\n\nWith the rapid expansion of data center infrastructure worldwide, driven by the demand for faster and more reliable digital services, the Data Center UPS market is poised to see continuous growth, driven by the increasing need for operational continuity, energy efficiency, and protection against power disruptions. As data centers become more sophisticated and widespread, the market for UPS solutions will continue to rise, driven by innovations in power protection technology and the increasing dependence on uninterrupted power supply to support global digital infrastructure.\n\nShift Towards Lithium-Ion Batteries for Enhanced Efficiency\n\n\n\nOne of the most prominent trends in the Data Center UPS market is the shift from traditional lead-acid batteries to more advanced lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries offer several advantages over lead-acid batteries, including higher energy density, longer lifespan, faster recharge times, and better overall efficiency. These benefits are particularly significant for data centers, which require reliable, long-duration power backup to maintain continuous operations during outages. Lithium-ion batteries also occupy less space, making them ideal for high-density data centers where space optimization is crucial.\n\nPower Output Insights\n\n\n\n501-1000 kVA segment held the largest market share in the Data Center UPS market in 2023 and is projected to continue its dominance throughout the forecast period. This power range is well-suited for medium to large data centers, which are experiencing rapid growth driven by the rising demand for cloud computing, data storage, and digital services. The 501-1000 kVA segment strikes a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and cost, making it the preferred option for a wide variety of data centers that require reliable power backup without the need for excessively large, expensive systems.\n\n\n\nThe growth of industries such as e-commerce, digital transformation, and data-intensive technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving the expansion of data centers that require this level of power. Advancements in UPS technologies, such as the adoption of lithium-ion batteries and energy-efficient designs, have made the 501-1000 kVA segment even more attractive by improving overall performance and reducing operational costs. As data centers continue to scale up to handle increasing demands for data processing and storage, this segment is expected to retain its dominance, thanks to its broad applicability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for modern data center operators.\n\n\n\nRegional Insights\n\n\n\nNorth America dominated the Data Center UPS market in 2023 and is anticipated to maintain its leadership throughout the forecast period. North America, particularly the United States, is home to some of the largest and most advanced data centers globally, driven by the continuous growth of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things. The region's robust digital infrastructure, along with the increasing demand for reliable and uninterrupted power supply for critical data processing and storage, has led to a high adoption rate of Data Center UPS systems.\n\n\n\nThe presence of key technology companies and major players in the data center industry, along with substantial investments in data center expansion, continue to fuel the demand for these systems. Stringent regulatory requirements related to data security, business continuity, and energy efficiency are prompting companies to adopt advanced power backup solutions to meet compliance standards. North America's focus on technological advancements, such as the integration of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient systems, also plays a pivotal role in maintaining the region's dominance. The increasing reliance on digital platforms, growing data volumes, and the rapid expansion of cloud services ensure that North America will remain a significant contributor to the Data Center UPS market during the forecast period.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 185 Forecast Period 2023 - 2029 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2023 $5.42 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2029 $8.53 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 7.8% Regions Covered Global\n\nReport Scope:\n\nKey Market Players\n\nSiemens AG\n\nABB Ltd.\n\nSchneider Electric SE\n\nHuawei Technologies Co.

Some rioters carried it as they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to stop Joseph R. Biden Jr. from being certified as the winner of the presidential election.\n\nCritics said Justice Alito should recuse himself from cases related to the Jan. 6 attack for displaying the flag, but he did not, saying his wife was the one responsible for flying it.\n\nMayor London Breed, who lost to Mr. Lurie in the November election, removed the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag from the city\u2019s display in May and replaced it with an American flag. She said at the time that she would consider removing others that were provocative, but did not end up doing so before she left office.\n\nStill flying under her watch \u2014 and again Friday, under Mr. Lurie\u2019s \u2014 was the Gadsden flag, a yellow banner with a coiled rattlesnake and the words \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d that has become associated with the conservative Tea Party movement and gun enthusiasts and is considered by some to have racist connotations.\n\nAlso still flying is the Betsy Ross flag, a Revolutionary War flag with 13 stars in a circle. That flag, too, has become controversial, adopted by some far-right groups to signify a time when white men held all power.

            "content": "Raiders minority owner Tom Brady is involved in his team\u2019s search for a coach. Fox broadcaster Tom Brady will be working postseason games involving one or more of the candidates to be hired to be his team\u2019s next coach.\n\nThe situation raises Brady\u2019s conflict of interest to a higher level.\n\nThe Raiders\u2019 initial candidates include Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, and Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. If Fox gets the divisional game involving the Lions, Brady will be working that game. If the Lions qualify for the conference championship, Brady will be working that game.\n\nIf the Lions, Ravens, or Chiefs qualify for the Super Bowl, Brady will be working that game.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s restrictions on Brady\u2019s ability to attend practice and to participate in production meetings, given his ownership of the Raiders, don\u2019t prevent him from calling people associated with an upcoming game, or from talking to them face-to-face on the field during pregame warmups.\n\nWill he be allowed to talk to Johnson and Glenn? (We\u2019re in the process of getting clarity on that question from the NFL.)\n\nIt\u2019s easy for the league (or anyone else) to say, \u201cTom would never cross the line during those conversations.\u201d In eight days, however, we\u2019ll be commemorating the 10-year anniversary of the game that prompted the NFL to conclude that Brady cheated and later covered up the evidence of his cheating.\n\nFrom the NFL\u2019s letter to Brady when it suspended him four games for #Deflategate:\n\n\"[T]here is substantial and credible evidence to conclude you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots\u2019 employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without your knowledge. Moreover, the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence (emails, texts, etc.), despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes was not plausible and contradicted by other evidence.\n\n\u201cYour actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football. The integrity of the game is of paramount importance to everyone in our league, and requires unshakable commitment to fairness and compliance with the playing rules. Each player, no matter how accomplished and otherwise respected, has an obligation to comply with the rules and must be held accountable for his actions when those rules are violated and the public\u2019s confidence in the game is called into question.\u201d\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s a difference between impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. Even if Brady never, ever does anything like what the league accused him of doing a decade ago, it just looks and feels off.\n\nBeyond Brady\u2019s pregame communications with Raiders coaching candidates, consider his in-game remarks about them. Will he pull punches on criticizing them if they do something he thinks is stupid? Will he excessively praise them? Will he comment on their futures as potential head coaches?\n\nWill he mention the Raiders are interested? Will he disclose to the Fox audience that he owns roughly 10 percent of the team? (Has he ever?)\n\nIn post-standards America, few seem to care about this. More should. The NFL should require Brady to pick a lane. Brady should do it on his own.\n\nWe keep thinking the league is hoping he eventually will. To date, he seems to be oblivious about the minefield through he\u2019s strolling. Which means either that he has less self-awareness than Michael Scott or that Brady is hyperaware of the fact that he can do whatever the hell he wants.\n\nHowever it plays out, the league has undergone a dramatic shift in its attitude toward Brady. In 2015, they thought he was a cheater and, basically, a liar. In 2025, they have a blind spot for Brady bigger than the case that holds, among other things, the Super Bowl MVP trophy he won two weeks after the #Deflategate game.",

Let's look at what UPS faced in 2024 and what to expect from it in 2025.\n\nWhat happened to UPS stock in 2024\n\nThe progression of the company's guidance throughout the year disappointed investors.

Given the cut to its 2024 guidance, investors had reason to doubt it would hit the three-year targets that management laid out in March.\n\nIn a nutshell, delivery volumes last year were weaker than expected, and the strained economic environment encouraged customers to pick cheaper options. As a result, UPS found that a greater percentage of its volume than expected was coming from lower-revenue-per-piece deliveries.

It's making productivity-enhancing network investments and downsizing operations to fit demand.

            "content": "Christina Hahn, who founded and leads the Dallas Asian American Art Club, said it\u2019s also crucial that Hyphen Space is a Dallas-based food business run by Asian Americans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of really cool boutique restaurants or pop-ups that are Asian-themed [in Dallas], but I\u2019m not sure if they are often Asian-led in that way. So I think for Alex and Vivian, as young Asian American entrepreneurs who are Texan Asians, it means something different,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, finding the funding to create these spaces hasn\u2019t been easy. While Nguy\u1ec5n and Luu opened their store in December, it was a four-year journey to get there.\n\nIn 2020, Nguy\u1ec5n and Luu launched their first brand, The Boba Plug, during the pandemic with $5,000. Motivated to share boba with uniquely Asian American flavors and fresh ingredients, the two catered over 90 pop-ups and events in North Texas over the last four years including collaborations with popular restaurants like La Casita and Detour Doughnuts.\n\nCatering across the region helped them grow a loyal customer base that was willing to follow them wherever they showed up. However, Nguy\u1ec5n said they wanted to have a physical location where they could more deeply connect with customers, foster community and host workshops and DJ sets.\n\nLike most entrepreneurs, Nguy\u1ec5n and Luu went to the bank to get a loan. But Nguy\u1ec5n said because he dropped out of high school and didn\u2019t go to college, banks typically view investing in him as \u201chigher risk. \u201d\n\n\u201cWe did apply for a loan, but then they said no. They said they wanted to see how we would work out with a checking account and other aspects as well,\u201d he said.\n\nThough they were denied a loan, the entrepreneurs had always intended to crowdfund through Kickstarter. So, they launched a campaign in March of 2024 and ended up raising over $36,000 from 233 supporters by April.\n\nLuu said funding the business through Kickstarter was also important to the entrepreneurs because it represents their roots in the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just big businesses or just having loans. It\u2019s these people that have supported you from the very beginning or those even interested in your story \u2013 they could find you in a more public way,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of those supporters is Diana Nguyen. She visited Hyphen Space for the first time during their soft launch in December, a week before their grand opening. The 24-year-old UI/UX designer lounged on the couch in the entryway as a barista made her a Japanese flash brew.\n\nNguyen, who is Vietnamese American, said she feels more comfortable going to Hyphen Space because it speaks directly to an Asian American audience.\n\n\u201cI like the ambiance of the place and it seems really peaceful,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really drawn to Hyphen space specifically because I know like other third parties, I think like WeWork and stuff, it feels more corporate.\u201d\n\nThe business owners are trying to build up their credit and tax history to eventually re-apply for a loan. In the meantime, they\u2019ve invested over $100,000 from pop-ups back into their business.\n\nThey\u2019ve also found support through the National Asian/Pacific Islander American Chamber of Commerce and Entrepreneurship\u2019s NextGen program.\n\nACE NextGen and the National ACE helped them apply for Grubhub\u2019s AAPISTRONG Restaurant Fund, which helps support independent, Asian American and Pacific Islander-owned restaurants. The grant provided about $5,000, which Nguy\u1ec5n and Luu have used to hire new employees and expand their store\u2019s payment system.\n\nThe entrepreneurs said learning how to apply for grants and loans has been pivotal.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that we weren\u2019t answering the questions the way that the grant givers are looking at it. It\u2019s just that inside knowledge that we didn\u2019t know as small-business owners, so we\u2019re always learning,\u201d Luu said.",

The last previous update was May 11, 2023.\n\nURL parameters are a handy way to control or pass information from one web page to another. URL parameters follow a question mark (?) and are made of a key and a value, separated by an equal sign (=). For example, Map Viewer takes the ID of the web map to open as a URL parameter.\n\nArcGIS Online web maps can also make use of other URL parameters to create and modify maps. When creating links in layer pop-ups, attributes can be used to craft URL parameters to open or interact with other apps or web sites.\n\nIn this example, we\u2019ll take a look at how to construct a URL string with parameters from attributes to pass information from a pop-up to another website.

Fields appear within curly braces { } and can be selected by typing the open brace { and then choosing a field from the drop-down list.\n\nAdd the desired text, type the open brace, and choose Parcel Identification Number.\n\nClick OK when finished.\n\nThe pop-up now displays the parcel identification number in the parcel pop-up.\n\nIn the following steps, a link will be added to the text element to open the Assessor\u2019s parcel information page for each parcel.\n\nStep 6 \u2013 Click Edit text in the text element in the pop-up.\n\nStep 7 \u2013 Add the text to be used for the link, in this case \u201cView Assessor\u2019s information.\u201d\n\nStep 8 \u2013 Select the text, then click the Link button.\n\nStep 9 \u2013 Construct the link with the parcel identification number as a URL parameter.\n\nFrom examining the County Assessor\u2019s site, we know that the link should look as follows:\n\nhttps://app1.pinal.gov/Search/Parcel-Details.aspx?Parcel_ID=402301880\n\nThe link in our selected text will use the parcel identifier field as follows:\n\nhttps://app1.pinal.gov/Search/Parcel-Details.aspx?Parcel_ID={PARCELID}\n\nAdd the link text as shown above, click the checkmark to save it, then click OK when finished.\n\nTip: You can add the field by typing it in manually, or an easier way is to copy the field name from the line above it and paste it into the link input.\n\nThe result\n\nThe pop-up now looks like this, with the View Assessor\u2019s information hyperlink.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nUPS (NYSE: UPS) has completed an acquisition of Frigo-Trans and its sister company BPL, a leader in health care logistics solutions across Europe. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nIn a news release, the company said it is looking to enhance the end-to-end capabilities for UPS Healthcare customers, which have seen rising demand for temperature-controlled and time-cricial logistics solutions on a global scale.\n\n\u201cFrigo-Trans\u2019 network includes temperature-controlled warehousing ranging from cryopreservation (-196\u00b0C) to ambient (+15\u00b0 to +25\u00b0C) as well as Pan-European cold chain transportation. This combined with the logistics solutions brought by BPL\u2019s time-critical freight forwarding capabilities further enhances UPS Healthcare solutions for customers in Europe,\u201d said the company.\n\nKnown for its small package business, UPS has been consistently investing in the health care sector. By the end of 2023, UPS Healthcare was a $10 billion business, accounting for one-tenth of total revenue. The company aims to double that number by 2026, primarily through acquisitions and new ventures.\n\n\u201cThe fast-paced innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is creating the need to have more integrated cold and frozen supply chains,\u201d said Kate Gutmann, UPS EVP and president of international, health care and supply chain solutions. \u201cFrigo-Trans will help deepen our portfolio of solutions for our customers and accelerate our journey to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world addressing their needs.\u201d\n\nThe health care industry is less subject to economic cycles and more focused on the progression and development of the industry as a whole. According to McKinsey and Co, \u201chealthcare profit pools will grow at a 7 percent CAGR, from $583 billion in 2022 to $819 billion in 2027.\u201d\n\nHealth care is moving toward a more personalized model with an emphasis on convenience to the patient.\n\nGutmann said in March at the 2024 Investor and Analyst Day presentation, \u201cthe health care logistics market is a major strategic move for UPS because the demand of health care is growing, and health care companies of all sizes are rapidly innovating to keep pace with the needs of an aging population and problems related to chronic disease. For example, new medical devices, especially ones suitable for home use, are on the rise.\u201d\n\nUPS is specifically targeting cold chain, clinical advanced therapies, labs and diagnostics, pharma, home health care, and medical devices \u2013 essentially products or lab samples that are time- and temperature-sensitive.\n\nThe post UPS broadens network with double health care acquisition appeared first on FreightWaves.",

Cal graduate and current member of Angel City FC Angelina Anderson was invited to join the senior team while the Golden Bears' current starterwas invited to the Futures Camp.Led by new USWNT head coach Emma Hayes, both camps will run concurrently from Jan. 14-21 at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson. The Futures Camp is a youth team call-up featuring up-and-coming Women's National Team prospects who are all age-eligible for the U.S. Under-23 WNT.This will be Anderson's first experience with the senior team, but not her first go-around with U.S. Soccer as she served as the starting goalkeeper and captain for the U17 team at the 2018 FIFA Women's World Cup in Uruguay. She also joined the U20 roster during the 2018 FIFA Women's World Cup later that summer. Anderson is one of four goalkeepers on the 26-player roster that earned an invitation and is one of six uncapped players who are all first-time call-ups.Anderson was selected by Angel City FC with the 27overall pick of the 2023 NWSL Draft and has made eight starts for the club. She has collected 35 saves in 720 minutes over the past two seasons. As a Bear, Anderson was one of the top goalkeepers in program history, finishing her career with the second-most shutouts (26) and the fifth-most saves (242). A three-time All-Pac-12 selection, Anderson was named the Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year and Pac-12 Freshman of the Year in 2019.\"Having known Angie for many years, we have long since admired her commitment to her craft,\" Cal head coachsaid. \"She has worked tirelessly to develop herself into one of the world's best goalkeepers and deserves this opportunity. We are excited to see the next phase unfold.\"Wy has been involved with US Soccer for the past seven years, from her first involvement at the U14 level to earning her first invitation to the USWNT Futures Camp next week. She is coming off an incredible performance as the starting keeper for the U20 FIFA Women's World Cup where she helped bring home a bronze medal, making key plays down the stretch - including a walk-off PK save that put the Americans into the semifinals. She also led the U15 team to a gold medal at the 2018 CONCACAF Championship by beating Mexico, El Salvador and Portugal.A two-time all-conference selection, Wy just wrapped up her junior season with the Bears and was named Second Team All-ACC despite missing a handful of matches to compete in U20 FIFA Women's World Cup. Wy showed up big when the lights were brightest, making a career-high nine saves vs. No. 3 North Carolina, including a PK save in that match with just 11 seconds to go before the Bears ultimately fell to the eventual national champions. She picked up her first shutout of the season vs. No. 16 Pitt, making five saves in the win, and added five more saves in 56 scoreless minutes against No. 1 Duke before leaving the match with an injury. Wy capped off the season with another seven saves on the road at No. 4 Arkansas in the second round of the NCAA Championships.\"Teagan has proven herself to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world in her age range after her incredible performances in the recent U20 World Cup,\" McGuire said. \"This call up to the futures camp shows the US federation sees great value in her talent and we are looking forward to seeing her flourish.\"A common denominator in the successes of Cal goalkeepers from Anderson and Wy to all-time saves leaders Emily Boyd and Emily Kruger is associate head coach and goalkeeper coach. Under Callahan's direction, those four Bear keepers have rewritten the program's record book and have amassed 11 all-conference honors.\"Angie and Teagan's US National team call ups showcase their incredible talents,\" McGuire said. \"Both developed their craft under the tutelage of, whose daily investment and care helped sharpen their skill sets and prepare them for the top level. Cori is a very special person with a gift for coaching the elite goalkeeper.\"",

Sam Upshaw Jr.\n\nUPS, the massive logistics company known for its brown package cars, is no stranger to health care.\n\nFor the past 20 years, UPS has shipped health care packages ranging from diabetes monitoring equipment and controlled substances monitored by the Drug Enforcement Agency to more than 45 million flu vaccines this year alone.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tom\u00e9, who took the helm in June 2020, has repeatedly said the company is focused on \"delivering what matters.\"\n\nUnder Tom\u00e9's leadership, part of the mission takes the form of UPS Healthcare, a $10 billion division of the company that was developed in 2020 \"to be focused exclusively on health care.\"\n\nFive years later, UPS is gearing up to bring its newest health care venture to life in UPS Labport, a $100 million facility adjacent to the UPS Centennial Hub in Louisville. It should be fully operational by the end of February.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind facility will house a largely automated shipping warehouse and medical labs for three companies. One of those companies, HealthTrackRx, a leading molecular testing laboratory that tests for infectious diseases, will perform testing on-site, cutting down shipping times and company costs.\n\nUPS Labport will combine diagnostics testing by laboratory companies with its world-renowned logistics and transportation network to help accelerate patient care.\n\nAfter a patient has a sample collected, it will make its way to UPS Worldport. By 1:30 a.m., when packages are put on trucks at Worldport, the sample will be taken to the new Labport facility three miles down the road. Lab techs for companies like HealthTrackRx will conduct diagnostic testing, completing these by 8 a.m. and providing the results to doctors that same morning.\n\n\"Patients need faster response times,\" Jason Vaughn, vice president of North America and health care logistics and distribution for UPS Healthcare, told the Courier Journal. \"The earlier diagnosis, you could really change the trajectory of something like a cancer diagnosis by having that next day diagnosis, versus a week later diagnosis.\"\n\nUPS company executives say in addition to accelerating test result delivery, UPS Labport also stands to center the health care industry around Louisville, bringing with it hundreds of jobs and industry leading innovation.\n\n\"I think that UPS' strength has always been the quality of service it provides, ... the focus on quality and precision really lends itself to health care, because there's so much urgency around delivery, accuracy, and those type of premium products where time-sensitive material, where quality matters,\" Vaughn said.\n\nHow will UPS Labport change the health care industry?\n\nThe more than 360,000-square-foot facility has been in the works for more than two years and was inspired by the growing need UPS saw for both lab space for testing companies and the need for more integrated logistics in the transportation of these sorts of items.\n\n\"Because of the amount of acceleration of the lab technologies, there's a lot more tests available now, so everybody's hunting for lab space,\" Vaughn said.\n\nUPS leases space to companies such as HealthTrackRx, who then use the space, which was custom outfitted for its specific needs, to conduct lab tests and provide results to medical providers.\n\nMartin Price, the CEO of HealthTrackRx, remembers hearing about the Labport concept about a year ago.\n\n\"There's going to be a constant pressure on health care to deliver better, faster results for patients and for providers, and Labport is a great place to do that,\" he said.\n\nThe concept, which promises fast delivery times to patients around the nation, is the reason Price led his company to invest $45.5 million and move its headquarters and lab operations to Louisville, opening HealthTrackRx's \"largest and most advanced laboratory to date, supporting the rapid growth and demand company leaders anticipate in the molecular diagnostics space,\" an October press release stated.\n\nPrice views this as an opportunity to get in on the \"ground floor\" of the future of health care logistics.\n\n\"The UPS footprint nationally gave us the ability to deliver that next morning service anywhere in the country,\" Price said. \"Underserved markets, metropolitan markets, you no longer had to live near an academic medical center to get the best technology for infectious disease detection.\"\n\nAnd before the facility even neared its official opening, UPS had sold all available lab space.\n\n\"We expected it to be a very hot commodity ... but we didn't expect to be sold out before we started,\" Vaughn said.\n\nLouisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that's a great sign.\n\n\"I think everyone wants to live in a place that is growing, that is ever-changing, that's dynamic, that is energetic, that's vibrant,\" Greenberg told the Courier Journal. \"And having companies like HealthTrackRx, decide to locate in Louisville is a sign that's what's happening here in Louisville.\"\n\nHow does UPS Labport work?\n\nThe facility, which will provide services to the entire nation, is classified as a Biosafety Level 2 lab, meaning it can handle infectious diseases such as influenza, salmonella and other samples that may be derived from blood or other cultures. To meet these standards, all of the lab spaces are equipped with specific ventilation, high-pressure water, and large power outputs, among other things.\n\nThe facility is also supported by four massive backup generators that would be able to keep the facility operating even if a natural disaster or something else took out power in the area.\n\nThe facility's specialty hinges on its ability to do early extraction of packages containing the samples from UPS Worldport, the largest air hub globally for UPS that is in Louisville, at 1:30 a.m., what Vaughn calls \"the earliest delivery we can get anywhere on the planet.\"\n\nOnce the packages, which are monitored and tracked via UPS Premier \u2014 a service that tracks packages with advanced sensor technology and live 24-hour-a-day monitoring \u2014 arrive at Labport, lab technicians in the facility will begin testing the specimens to have results returned to physicians by the same morning.\n\n\"As we began to evaluate the health care industry ...we really thought we could add a lot of value by improving the performance of the supply chains within the health care industry,\" Vaughn said.\n\nAnother thing Vaughn finds special about Labport is the amount of collaboration that could be facilitated by the companies housed inside, noting cross-company collaboration is common on the research and development side of the industry but not as frequent on the lab side.\n\n\"I think everyone's trying to figure out how to do it better, faster, cheaper and those types of things,\" Vaughn said. \"By creating this environment, UPS, our goal is to be the number one complex health care provider in the world.\"\n\nIn the warehouse portion of the facility, there are two companies set up using advanced automation such as robotic arms, automatic size-controlled package boxing, and a closed loop transport system to take products, such as continuous glucose monitoring systems for people with diabetes or colon screening kits, and distribute them to customers across the U.S.\n\nWhat else does UPS Healthcare do in Louisville?\n\nUPS Healthcare is currently a $10 billion business with lofty goals to double that by 2026.\n\nPeople like Vaughn and Nikki Gaudio, division manager for UPS Healthcare, know Labport will play a vital role in reaching that goal; but also know the work at the other Louisville area UPS Healthcare facilities is essential in growing the business.\n\nSituated on the same campus as Labport is another 870,000-square-foot UPS Healthcare facility where between 250 to 500 people work daily.\n\n\"We do everything in this building, from biopharma, we do controlled substance in this facility, we do vaccines, we do med devices, invitro diagnostic types, everything,\" Gaudio told the Courier Journal.\n\nWhile this facility has been in Louisville since 2008, well before UPS Healthcare was founded, much of its temperature-controlled storing and transporting of medical items is unfamiliar to locals.\n\nBesides the more than 45 million flu vaccines that have flowed through the facility this year, UPS Healthcare was also responsible for transporting \"every COVID test kit [and] every COVID vaccine,\" from Pfizer and Moderna during the height of the pandemic, Gaudio said. Additionally, UPS Healthcare chartered flights to get critical breathing drugs to patients in hospitals all across the country.\n\n\"During the pandemic, we really brought the nation back on its feet,\" Gaudio said of UPS Healthcare.\n\n'Something that's not being done anywhere else'\n\nAlong with the $100 million investment to develop the Labport, the facility will also create roughly 400 jobs in Louisville, both for UPS and companies like HealthTrackRx.\n\n\"The success of our business lands on the shoulders of really talented, committed staff who work in overnight shifts to get these results back to patients each morning, and we're going to be leaning heavily on the local community,\" Price said.\n\nGov. Andy Beshear, who has centered much of his two terms around economic development and the recruitment and retention of leading industries, knows health care is one of the nation's fastest growing industries, and believes this latest development will allow the state to have a first look at the future.\n\n\"It's creating exciting jobs in fields where people want to be a part of it, and we're doing something that's not being done anywhere else,\" Beshear told the Courier Journal. \"Kentucky is going to be a place that you can come to and truly succeed in those industries of the future, knowing that your job isn't just safe today, but it's going to be around for decades.\"\n\nUPS Labport is roughly three miles from the world-famous UPS Worldport, where much of the roughly 3% of the daily global gross domestic product shipped by the company is transported.\n\n\"Businesses that rely on Labport and UPS are all about innovation and speed and this addition is showing that Louisville is a place where we understand that, and we will support businesses that want to be a part of this growth opportunity for our city,\" Greenberg said.\n\nAs UPS looks to the future and continues to grow its health care division with UPS Labport, Louisville will remain part of the growing UPS Healthcare supply chain's \"heartbeat.\"\n\n\"Louisville is really the flagship operation for UPS in all of its divisions. Our airline headquarters is here. UPS Worldport is here. Our largest health care logistics and distribution footprint is here,\" Vaughn said. \"The capabilities in Louisville are unique.\"\n\nContact business reporter Olivia Evans at oevans@courier-journal.com or on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter at @oliviamevans_.",

APO/FPO is mail that might be ordered for someone in the Armed Forces. Those UPS packages are being rejected and returned. This change only affects items ordered from online vendors utilizing UPS services. It does not affect packages from USPS or FedEx.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re ordering something for like a military service member, and they use the APO/FBO address, if it goes SurePost, it will get rejected.\u201d\n\nFile photo\n\nThat is Steamboat Springs Postmaster, Alex Garza. He says people are coming in to the local post office to complain to the clerks, when the local post office employees have nothing to do with it. He asks, please be patient as this change is affecting 31,000 zip codes simultaneously.\n\n\u201cThe addresses themselves are fine. The issue is that the service is gone, the UPS SurePost is gone. So if you order something that says it has free shipping through UPS, that normally would have come SurePost, now that it is gone, they have to use the physical address. Unfortunately it means that these customers really have to work to figure out which way it should be sent because if they do it wrong, it will be rejected before it even comes to the post office.\u201d\n\nIf you are using UPS with a P.O. Box, please check with the shipper to avoid any issues. If something is being delivered to a P.O. Box or APO/FPO destination (military), USPS is the only carrier authorized to deliver to those destinations.\n\nThe following article was shared with Steamboat Radio News by the local postmaster. What\u2019s Really Happening with SurePost?\n\nWhat\u2019s Really Happening with SurePost? By Joe Wilkinson\n\nOn December 31, 2024, the UPS/USPS Negotiated Service Agreement (NSA) officially expired, marking the end of a long, mostly silent period of negotiations. Unfortunately, these talks failed to produce a resolution, leaving shippers with unexpected consequences. Starting on January 2, 2025, shippers noticed an immediate problem: SurePost labels for P.O. Boxes and APO/FPO addresses began to be rejected without prior warning. For many, this left them scrambling to find a solution, as USPS is the only carrier authorized to deliver to P.O. Boxes and APO/FPO destinations. With the expiration of the NSA, the only remaining delivery options for these specific addresses is direct USPS shipping or using workshare partners still relying on USPS for final delivery.\n\nThe USPS under Louis DeJoy has been pushing their workshare partners out of their network since mid-2024 by effectively removing DDU injections, by removing incentives for these injections, increasing Parcel Select rates, and aggressively negotiating NSA renewals. While many believed that UPS would receive special preference due to the massive USPS Parcel Select volumes they represented, in the end it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nLogic suggests that UPS is planning to move these deliveries in-house, largely mirroring FedEx\u2019s Ground Economy model. This theory is supported by the recent SurePost rate increases and DAS/EAS changes, which would provide revenue offsets for the increased cost of direct delivery. This would still leave the P.O. Box and APO/FPO deliveries without a solution. But those are a fairly small subset of current SurePost volumes.\n\nIn mid-December UPS announced rate and surcharge increases beginning January 13, 2025. These increases included a roughly 9.9% increase on 1-10 lb. SurePost packages and around 6% on SurePost packages above 10 lbs. But what has been largely overlooked is a massive increase on DAS (61.8%) and EAS (69.4%) surcharges, bringing the gross surcharges in line with the Ground surcharges. Combined we have seen shippers taking as much as a 30% effective rate increase. Moreover, the surcharges will change the financial model for rural deliveries for many shippers, making options other than SurePost more competitive. In essence, it appears that UPS is trying to retain competitiveness for high-density metro deliveries, but push low-density, rural deliveries upstream to Ground service levels, or out to USPS and other carriers.\n\nThe industry has known for months that things were going to change. The expiration date of the UPS/USPS NSA was known. The USPS\u2019s push to limit workshare partners\u2019 presence in their network was known. But what seemed to irk most online commenters was the abrupt nature of the change. Shippers awakening in the new year with labels rejecting, with no notice, and seemingly no contingencies, has left many shippers fuming.\n\nAs of now, this remains a developing story. The expiration of the UPS/USPS NSA is just the beginning of a larger shift in the shipping landscape. As more information becomes available, shippers will need to adapt to these changes and reevaluate their strategies for handling time-flexible, e-commerce deliveries.\n\nStay tuned for updates as this situation unfolds.\n\nJoe Wilkinson is VP, Professional Services (Transportation Consulting) at Intelligent Audit.

(Scotty Perry/Bloomberg)\n\n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]\n\nUPS Inc. has been quietly building a health care empire to offset stagnating revenue in its core package delivery business.\n\nSpecialized logistics services, unlike standard brown-box delivery, have appealing profit margins. A customer who needs injectable medicines shipped overnight in a refrigerated box is willing to pay a hefty premium.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re maybe getting $300 on that shipment at the same cost of delivering, say, a J.

The company aims to double that number by 2026 with the help of acquisitions and new business ventures.\n\nUPS ranks No. 1 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest for-hire carriers in North America. UPS Supply Chain Solutions is No. 4 on the TT Top 100 logistics companies list.\n\nFor its latest endeavor, UPS is renting out about 100,000 square feet of custom laboratory space near its main air cargo hub in Louisville. Construction was completed at the end of the year, and medical companies have already locked up all the available space for the next 10-plus years. By setting up shop directly on UPS property, they\u2019ll be able to process test results within a matter of hours. The facility, known as Labport, will soon be bustling with technicians preparing samples, scientists peering under microscopes, and computers churning out data to treat faraway patients.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a parcel company. In fact, the business is so unusual that it\u2019s ditching the trademark brown that has made UPS delivery drivers, trucks and cargo planes recognizable around the world for the last century.

Premium services are a way to stem the bleeding. UPS has said the operating margin for its health care business is in the high teens, compared with 10% for the overall business in 2023.\n\nImage\n\nA worker uses a Locus robot designed to assist with packages and automation. (Scotty Perry/Bloomberg)\n\n\u201cIt is critical for the long-term future of UPS,\u201d said John Haber, a strategist at Transportation Insight Holding Co. who worked for UPS for almost a decade. \u201cThey\u2019re putting a lot of their eggs in this basket.\u201d\n\nCEO Carol Tom\u00e9 sees health care as a highly specialized component of the UPS system. Shipping blood tests or flu shots requires close location monitoring, temperature control and occasionally intercepting packages that have had a mishap, none of which a network transporting 22 million packages a day is designed to handle.\n\nThe company built a health care campus near its Louisville headquarters in the mid-2000s, followed by specialized distribution centers across the globe. A formal business unit was carved out in 2019. That timing turned out to be fortuitous since the pandemic and COVID vaccine rollout led to a surge in demand for \u201ccold chain\u201d solutions that preserve temperature-sensitive products in transit.\n\nTom\u00e9 wants UPS to become the No. 1 complex health care logistics provider in the world. So far, the business is still under the radar for many on Wall Street. On the company\u2019s last earnings call in October, not a single question was asked about health care.\n\nTom\u00e9\n\nLabport could change that. It\u2019s bigger than two football fields and comes with a conference room, pantry areas and offices. There\u2019s also an attached 182,000-square-foot warehouse where companies can lease space to store and ship their products.\n\nMassive windows are a prominent feature of the main building, both to contrast the drabness often associated with medical offices and to show off the facility\u2019s bells and whistles. Visitors will have a clear view into the \u201ccommand center\u201d where some 15 to 20 UPS employees will track, monitor and manage shipments on numerous computer screens.\n\nUPS declined to say how much it spent building the facility or what it\u2019s charging the initial tenants.\n\nHealthTrackRx is one of those first few customers. The molecular diagnostics company consolidated its lab operations to Louisville in 2022 to be near UPS, which transports about 90% of its test samples. Every day specimens are collected from clinics around the country and packed onto planes bound for Kentucky, where they\u2019re unloaded and taken to a lab that\u2019s staffed overnight to get results to physicians by the next morning.\n\nCondensing operations around UPS has helped HealthTrackRx bring down the prices of its tests to about a quarter of what they were before the pandemic, said CEO Martin Price. \u201cThe business has scaled faster than we would\u2019ve expected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new Labport space will double HealthTrackRx\u2019s footprint in Louisville, and the company plans to staff around 200 workers there. Price said that could open up more opportunities, including using UPS services to assemble testing kits, a process currently done by different vendors.\n\nUPS\u2019 Bolla said it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d that the company will open more health care hubs since the first leases were snapped up so quickly. Potential locations include an expansion in Louisville, or new sites near other freight hubs such as Cologne, Germany.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had great success with this first experiment with Labport,\u201d Bolla said. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely considering other places.\u201d\n\nUPS has bought several cold chain transportation and other health care logistics companies in the last couple of years, mostly in Europe. Its services now include everything from clinical trial logistics to transportation of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nMore acquisitions are necessary if UPS is going to reach its revenue targets by 2026, according to Third Bridge\u2019s de Ruijter. The volume growth in health care logistics isn\u2019t rapid enough for the company to double sales, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to do it organically.\u201d\n\nOther companies are going after health care revenue, too. FedEx Corp. signed health care deals tied to more than $500 million in revenue in fiscal 2024 and expects to gain U.S. market share this year. It also opened a cooling facility dedicated to medical storage and transport in the Netherlands in July. Germany\u2019s DHL Group said last February that it\u2019s investing $200 million in new U.S. warehouses and technology to serve health care and life sciences customers.\n\nThe health care logistics market is expected to more than double in value from 2023 to 2032, approaching nearly $200 billion, according to Global Market Insights. That growth is being driven by an aging population, rising rates of chronic disease and an increasing number of medicines that require refrigeration, like the hugely popular Ozempic and Zepbound shots used to treat weight loss and diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm,\u201d said Dan Gagnon, vice president of global strategy and acquisition integration at UPS Healthcare, in an interview.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nGagnon doesn\u2019t expect health care to be a \u201cwindfall\u201d for profit margins because of the high cost of equipment, infrastructure and labor. Importantly, it\u2019s a stable business with sticky customers. The company has also found that health care clients wind up buying more ancillary services than customers in other sectors.\n\nLabport will be buzzing with activity soon. But it will take time before executives know whether the gamble on health care is paying off as promised. Until then, they\u2019ll be stocking up on navy blue smocks and coaxing investors to get behind the endeavor. Because if it works, it just might change the future of UPS.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important is setting ambitious targets, which we\u2019ve done,\u201d said Bolla. \u201cThere\u2019s a big market still to gain.\u201d",

            "content": "By staff\n\nLos Angeles, CA \u2013 As the holiday peak season wraps up, after workers around the country toiled away for a surge in parcel deliveries, the United Parcel Service (UPS) plans again to shutter large facilities due to automation.\n\nOn January 15, the UPS facility in Vernon, California, also known as the Grande Vista hub, will be shutting its doors for a year-long closure. The purpose of the closure is for building renovations and the automation of various classifications, part of UPS\u2019s larger \u201cNetwork of the Future\u201d project, which aims to automate union jobs to reduce labor costs.\n\nGrande Vista is one of 200 hubs around the country that UPS plans to close for automation. The closure is expected to affect over 1000 workers who are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n\nDuring the closure UPS has claimed that they would offer the Grande Vista employees temporary transfers to other facilities \u201cwithin reasonable commuting distance.\u201d One of the options is in a neighboring city, Bell, but the other options are 25 to 60 miles away, in San Fernando and the Inland Empire region of the state. Since bidding goes by seniority, it is anticipated that higher seniority workers will take most available spots at the Bell facility, which can only house about 160 employees, and the hundreds of lower seniority employees will be forced to go to the further buildings, choose layoff, or quit.\n\nUPS has been slow to communicate with Grande Vista workers and the local union about the upcoming changes and options for employees. Many workers fear for their jobs and livelihood.\n\nSome rank-and-file union members are taking matters into their own hands and have decided to fight back against this blatant effort to demoralize workers into retiring, choosing layoff, or quitting. These outspoken workers are demanding closer options for workers to commute to and pointing out that San Fernando and the Inland Empire are not \u201cwithin reasonable commuting distance.\u201d So far, they have gathered hundreds of petition signatures and say they plan to present those petitions to the company and the public.\n\nAlejandro Orellana is a union shop steward at the Grande Vista site and said, \u201cWe have to show UPS that we are united in denouncing automation, even if this changes nothing, least we can say is that we tried rather than stood by and do nothing. We are fighting for our lives and our future. Automation kills jobs and we the Teamsters should not be complacent to the termination of Teamster jobs in favor of an automated workplace.\u201d\n\nOnce the automation and retrofit operations are completed, many workers are expected to be reclassified to fit the company\u2019s needs. For the Teamsters at Grande Vista UPS, fighting back against this closure and automation is part of a long fight to save workers\u2019 jobs.\n\n#LosAngelesCA #CA #Labor #Teamsters #UPS #Feature",

Blockers, \u201cUnfair Canada\u201d pop-ups and an aerial anniversary tour.\n\nRXBAR IS CALLING B.S. ON TOXIC NEW YEAR\u2019S RESOLUTIONS\n\nEvery year around this time, we\u2019re all inundated with \u201cNew Year, New You\u201d-style brand messaging that all but says \u201cyou\u2019re not good enough.\u201d But Kellanova-owned RXBAR is calling B.S. on the annual bid for self-reinvention with a \u201cB.S. Blocker\u201d campaign that highlights its belief in being real and embracing simplicity.\n\nTo demonstrate its ethos and get consumers to laugh about the unrealistic, and often toxic, resolutions they\u2019re pressured to make each January, RXBAR has been roaming New York City since Jan. 3 in a truck that reads \u201cNew Year, New You B.S. Blocker\u201d and functions as an \u201cad-blocker\u201d that shields people from toxic messaging. By texting their B.S. sightings to a dedicated number, participants can watch the vehicle pull up to literally cover the ad in (near) real time.\n\nTo boot, beginning Jan. 7, consumers can comment on RXBAR\u2019s Instagram account about the B.S. they\u2019re leaving behind, then receive a discount code in return, through the end of the month. The campaign additionally features prominent billboard takeovers across New York that offer the public encouraging reminders and positive affirmations, as well as a partnership with influencer @dudettewithsign for added amplification. We say: Kudos to RXBAR for replacing harmful messaging with relatable humor.\n\nTHE GOODYEAR BLIMP IS FLOATING TO A CITY NEAR YOU\n\nThe Goodyear Blimp has drifted over land and sea for the last century, embedding itself in cultural moments and tentpole events, and driving larger-than-life brand awareness for the tire company. This year, Goodyear will take the iconic aircraft, and its fandom, to new heights with a 100-plus stop aerial tour to commemorate its centennial.\n\nFestivities kicked off Jan. 1 in Pasadena, CA, at the Rose Bowl as Goodyear not only launched its 100th anniversary programming, but marked its 70th year providing aerial coverage of the annual matchup.\n\nOver the next several months, the multipronged campaign will come to life as the brand delivers flights over more cities, appearances at new events, limited-edition merch, and the biggest draw for fans: a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d chance to fly in the Goodyear Blimp. Oh yes, three \u201cPassenger Flight Giveaway\u201d sweepstakes winners will enjoy a seat on the aircraft\u2014something that just 0.0006 percent of Americans have ever experienced, according to the brand. That\u2019s one serious flight of fancy.\n\nPhotos: Courtesy of Goodyear\n\nFLIGHT ATTENDANTS COMBAT UNPAID WORK WITH \u2018UNFAIR CANADA\u2019 POP-UPS\n\nAir Canada\u2019s flight attendants have reached their limit, and they\u2019re leveraging experiential to retaliate against unpaid work. From Dec. 20-22, members of the Air Canada arm of the Canada Union of Public Employees (CUPE) launched an \u201cUnfair Canada\u201d campaign with a satirical pop-up in Vancouver designed to show consumers just how terrible their flights could be if the airline\u2019s \u201ccorporate greed\u201d continues.\n\n\u201cFlight attendants are largely only paid while the flight is in motion, working for free while boarding, deplaning and carrying out critical safety checks,\u201d said Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada branch of CUPE, in a press release. \u201cAs we head into contract negotiations, we want to show Air Canada they need to give their workers the respect and the proper pay they deserve.\u201d\n\nDuring the activation, attendees got a glimpse of seatless planes that require passengers to stand, the new on-board drink size (served from an eye dropper) and updated carry-on policies, like a no-phones-allowed rule. While on-site, visitors could also send an email to Air Canada, calling for the brand to pay its flight crews fairly. The pop-up experience was then replicated in Toronto from Jan. 3-5. Was the strategy savage? Yes. Was it warranted? Absolutely.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Canada Union of Public Employees\n\nFANS EAT UP A DECADE\u2019S WORTH OF NYE \u2018TACO DROPS\u2019\n\nFor a chunk of Taco Bell fans, the New Year\u2019s Eve ball drop in New York City is old news. Very old news. Over the last decade, consumers hailing from near and far have descended on Tucson, AZ, to watch the annual Taco Bell \u201cTaco Drop.\u201d And it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. Rather than dropping a ball of glowing lights, the city lowers a massive taco installation (this year, it looked to be a Doritos Locos Taco) as fireworks blast in the background.\n\nThe spectacle, which this year was part of the Taco Bell New Year\u2019s Eve Downtown Bowl Bash hosted by the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl, has been taking place since 2014, and now draws thousands of fans to Tucson. Live M\u00e0s, indeed.\n\nFUTURECASTING WITH PINTEREST: PREDICTIONS FOR TOP 2025 TRENDS\n\nIf any brand has an accurate crystal ball, it\u2019s Pinterest. Over the last few years, the social media platform has been leveraging mountains of user data to precisely pinpoint what matters to consumers, and in turn, the movements that will dominate the landscape in the months ahead. For 2025, bold forms of expression and maximalism are leading the charge.\n\nLast month, the company released its annual Pinterest Predicts trend report, providing marketers and brands with a buffet of relevant themes to work with in 2025. Among them: Surreal Soirees, Pickle Fix, Nesting Parties, Castlecore and Sea Witchery (call us hipsters, but we\u2019ve been summoning our inner sea witch for years). The report\u2019s trends are based on the unique search patterns of more than half a billion monthly active users who leverage Pinterest to plan what\u2019s next for them, from meals to vacations to fashion.\n\nTo celebrate the launch of this year\u2019s Pinterest Predicts, from Dec. 9-13, Pinterest dropped 20-plus exclusive products and experiences (think: 14-carat tooth gems and hand-painted pianos) on a first-come, first-served basis, giving users a chance to take 2025 trends for a spin before everyone else, and find new inspo for the year.\n\nThe trend drops also included offerings from brand partners. Take Marriott Bonvoy, which partnered with Pinterest to give away a free trip to a high mountain destination to allow consumers to experience the \u201cPeak Travel\u201d trend at its finest. The brands also revealed a \u201cPeak Travel Concierge\u201d in New York City, where visitors receive personalized, mountain-inspired gifts, ranging from simple swag to hotel vouchers.\n\nMore From The Brief:",

The new office, in downtown Salt Lake City, is expected to accommodate 50 employees.\n\nChief Executive and Managing Partner Vicken Haleblian said the firm \u2013 typically referred to as HCVT \u2013 made the decision based on its \u201cgo to the talent\u201d growth strategy.\n\n\u201cRather than make acquisitions, we are expanding in \u2013 and to \u2013 dynamic metro areas with thriving business communities, pools of experienced talent and a concentration of exceptional accounting programs,\u201d Haleblian wrote in an email. \u201cThe presence of accounting programs is important \u2013 if not essential \u2013 to this approach, because the schools give us ongoing access to high-caliber job candidates each year and a sizable, alumni network with professional accounting experience.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the start of what looks like a growth spurt for HCVT. The company later this month will launch its first San Diego office and late last year doubled its office in Phoenix, which opened in 2018 with two employees and now has more than 60.\n\n\u201cWe have found that recent graduates and alumni in markets like Salt Lake City and Phoenix value the quality of life in these cities and are often hesitant to leave for Southern California,\u201d Haleblian said. \u201cBy essentially bringing HCVT to them, they can remain in the communities they love and enjoy the professional opportunities we offer.\u201d\n\nFormed in 1991, HCVT has local offices in Camarillo, Encino, Glendale, Irvine, Long Beach, Monrovia, Pasadena and Westlake Village. Additionally, it has a location in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nHaleblian noted that company leadership is eyeing additional U.S. metro areas such as Denver for future growth and was also in the midst of setting the stage for global expansion, starting with Armenia.\n\nHCVT clientele includes entertainment companies, high-net-worth individuals and celebrities, private equity firms, family offices, real estate developers and foreign companies doing business in the United States.\n\nLeading the growth for HCVT\u2019s Utah presence are Blake Christian from the Park City office and Jonathan Wang, who is the firm\u2019s strategic markets leader and also spends time at its Irvine and Phoenix operations.\n\n\u201cWe expect great things from this office, given the roster of motivated, engaged, and talented graduates from local universities,\u201d Wang said of the Salt Lake City office.",

The proposal was one of 20 recommendations made by Professor Alexis Jay following her seven year inquiry into child sexual abuse, which concluded in 2022. Cooper said the change would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill this spring. The Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp welcomed the move but urged the home secretary to announce a national statutory public inquiry into sexual abuse of children by grooming gangs.\n\nHe argued that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), led by Prof Jay, had been \"mainly directed\" at other child sexual abuse issues and only covered six of the towns involved in the \"gang rape scandal\". \"We need to get to the truth,\" he told MPs, and said an inquiry, with powers to compel witnesses to attend and give evidence under oath, was needed. He added that if the government would not agree to an inquiry, the Conservatives would try to amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to force the government to hold one.\n\nCooper did not commit to holding a new inquiry and instead stressed the importance of implementing the recommendations of inquiries that had already been completed. Introducing mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse was one of the key recommendations from the IICSA report. It said there should be a legal requirement for those who work in \"regulated activity or work in a position of trust\" to report abuse in certain circumstances including if they \"observed recognised indicators\" of child sexual abuse. The report also said it should be a criminal offence not to report abuse if they are told about it by the child or perpetrator, or if they have witnessed a child being sexually abused. The previous Conservative government had committed to introducing mandatory reporting, but did not specify sanctions for failing to do so. Addressing the House of Commons on Monday afternoon, Cooper said she would introduce mandatory reporting and a new offence targeting those who fail to report abuse or cover it up. The home secretary also promised to make grooming an aggravated factor in the sentencing of abuse cases and \"overhaul\" how information and evidence on child sexual abuse is gathered. Earlier in the day, Prof Jay who now chairs the Act on IICSA campaign group urged ministers to adopt a \"clear timeline\" to accept all the report's recommendations. Cooper said Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips had met with Prof Jay last year and had convened a cross-government group to \"drive forward change\". She said she would set out timescales following work with a new victims and survivors panel.",

            "content": "A parent sued the former coaching staff of a Texas high school football team, alleging that players including her son were hospitalized following a grueling workout that included roughly 400 push-ups. The workout, from an offseason training program devised by former Rockwall-Heath High School football head coach John Harrell, demanded the entire team stop and perform 16 push-ups for any individual infraction during exercises, according to the lawsuit and an external investigation commissioned by the Rockwall Independent School District and reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nIn a January 2023 workout, Harrell\u2019s assistant coaches ordered the team to perform 398 push-ups after they had tallied up dozens of infractions that day, according to video footage reviewed by investigators. The exercise took about 40 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDays after the workout, the investigation found, students were taken to hospitals with symptoms of rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by overexertion in which muscles break down. The by-products that release into the bloodstream can damage the kidneys.\n\nInvestigators identified 26 students who presented symptoms of the illness, and a physician who reviewed students\u2019 medical records found 12 met the criteria for a rhabdomyolysis diagnosis, the investigation states. Several of the students sought emergency care for their symptoms in the days after the workout, although the lawsuit does not say how many were hospitalized. The investigation stated that more students probably could have been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis but did not seek medical treatment.\n\nThe Rockwall-Heath cases recall similar incidents involving college sports teams, including a workout last September that saw five members of the Tufts University lacrosse team hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nValencia Smith, the parent of one of the Rockwell-Heath players who allegedly developed rhabdomyolysis, sued Harrell and 12 other former and current assistant coaches in late December, more than a year after Harrell\u2019s workouts embroiled the north Texas community in controversy. Harrell did not know about rhabdomyolysis when designing his workout plan and had been instructed by his athletic director not to include punitive exercises for fear of injuries and legal repercussion, according to the investigation.\n\nMeredith Walker, an attorney for Harrell and an assistant coach, Alex Contreras, said Harrell denied any wrongdoing, and Contreras declined to comment. Walker said the coaches are protected under Texas law, which does not hold school employees liable for acts within the scope of their duties, except in cases of excessive force in the discipline of students or negligence resulting in bodily harm.\n\n\u201cMr. Harrell\u2019s liability under the Texas Education Code is limited and Plaintiff has failed to take the steps necessary to maintain these claims,\u201d Walker said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome team members defended Harrell, who was placed on administrative leave shortly after the workouts and resigned in March 2023, while players who spoke out about the injuries were bullied online and called \u201csissies\u201d by another student, according to the Rockwall investigation.\n\n\u201cThese coaches have treated me with so much respect and have treated me like their son,\u201d Brady Luff, then a captain of the team and high school junior, told local TV station WFAA shortly after the workouts. He said Harrell \u201cwould never make us do a workout thinking it was going to put any of us at risk.\u201d\n\nMichael Sawicki, an attorney for Smith, argued that the coach had a responsibility to care for his players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf my job as a coach is to design a program, and I ignore the fact that if I make students do 400 push-ups, they\u2019re going to have rhabdomyolysis and potentially lifelong injuries \u2026 that\u2019s kind of the minimum level of reasonableness you should employ,\u201d Sawicki told The Washington Post.\n\nThe Rockwall Independent School district did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWalker, Harrell\u2019s and Contreras\u2019s attorney, said that some of the coaches named in the lawsuit were not present at the workouts. The other 11 coaches named in the lawsuit, some of whom still work at Rockwall-Heath, according to its website, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHarrell had just completed his first year as head coach of the Rockwall-Heath Hawks when he began developing the team\u2019s offseason workout plan, according to the investigation. Harrell told investigators that he had discussed with his athletic director that his team had been beset by a high number of penalties in the previous season and that he wanted to develop an offseason program to improve the team\u2019s discipline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarrell\u2019s \u201cHawk Process\u201d stressed attention to detail and declared any small missteps by players would require the team to do 16 push-ups \u2014 the number of games the team needed to win to win a championship.\n\nHarrell did not consult with a certified strength and conditioning coach while developing his plan, and he had been reminded not to assign any \u201cpunitive and corporal\u201d activities to his players by his athletic director in a 2021 notice, according to the investigation.\n\nAcross several workout sessions in January 2023, Harrell and his assistant coaches frequently called out infractions while their players warmed up and ordered push-ups, students told the investigators. The players were penalized for failing to clap on a whistle, having a foot over a starting line for exercises and performing exercises poorly, they said. The coaches also called for sets of push-ups to be restarted if any student wasn\u2019t doing them correctly. In several sessions, the coaches ordered close to or over 100 push-ups, according to the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of each session, most students were not completing the hundreds of push-ups asked of them and only did modified push-ups or held themselves in a plank position, according to the investigation.\n\nHarrell stopped the workouts on Jan. 9, days after a group had been ordered to do around 400 push-ups, because some of his players began reporting swelling muscles and dark colored urine, according to the investigation.\n\nOn Jan. 9, a resident nurse also emailed school officials out of concern of the number of football players who were showing up to their emergency room with rhabdomyolysis, according to email records seen by The Post. The email said the students risked kidney failure and urged the school to notify parents.\n\nA National Institutes of Health review found that between 10 and 40 percent of rhabdomyolysis cases end in kidney failure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Wang, a sports medicine physician, previously told The Post that the condition can arise during strenuous exercise \u201cin team settings, class settings, where people are trying to keep up with others, and they don\u2019t want to look weak or that they can\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nSawicki said that was the environment the Rockwall-Heath players were thrust into. After some students reported injuries, they faced scorn and bullying from other team members, according to the investigation. Parents told investigators that local community members \u201cquestion[ed] the manhood\u201d of players who were injured in online comments.\n\n\u201cThat concerned me,\u201d Sawicki said of the investigation\u2019s suggestion that some players may not have sought medical attention due to the backlash. \u201cBecause the kids trying to maintain the reputation of the program may have suffered injury.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe investigation concluded that Harrell had engaged in misconduct by implementing his workout plan and failing to consult with Rockwall-Heath\u2019s athletic trainers about the risks of the punitive push-ups. It said that Harrell was \u201copen, honest, and transparent\u201d once he learned of the injuries his players faced and spent time researching rhabdomyolysis and contacting parents to encourage them to seek medical care.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the coach is an evil person,\u201d Sawicki said. \u201cBut I think you are responsible for creating a safe program.\u201d\n\nThe investigation also suggested that Harrell was not the only coach who lacked knowledge about rhabdomyolysis.",

Time flies when you're a game-changer in the industry! Let\u2019s take a peek at how together we\u2019re revolutionizing returns \u2013 and making the lives of retailers in the U.S. a lot more zen.\n\nWhy it matters: A staggering $890 billion worth of retail purchases were projected to be returned in 2024. If you\u2019re an enterprise retailer or a small business choosing a logistics partner, your customers expect fast returns and even faster refunds/exchanges. That\u2019s a big deal, and it\u2019s why working with UPS can make a huge difference.\n\nWhen Happy Returns joined forces with us, our goal was to combine innovative tech expertise with top-notch logistics. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing \u2013 we\u2019re empowering businesses to offer their customers the ability to return items as easily as they buy them.\n\nOur competitive difference: In only a few days after the deal closed, Happy Returns worked with experts at UPS to fully integrate their tech with our network. The result? At any one of the nearly 8,000 Return Bar locations around the U.S., which includes The UPS Store and others, customers can now drop off their returns, no label or box needed. We ship the items where they need to go \u2013 and your customers get their refunds or exchanges approved instantly.\n\nIf you\u2019re a retailer or a small business choosing a logistics partner, here are a few other stats we\u2019re proud of, powered by our work with Happy Returns:\n\nNew tech has driven a 50% efficiency increase in our item sorting .\n\n. Thanks to Geek+ robots, the typical time to ship out items to retailers decreased by 35% .\n\n. Within just one month of automation, our process accuracy surged by 65%.\n\nWithin a year of our merger, we\u2019ve driven results and ensured that customers can return goods in just a few clicks. If you\u2019re shipping with UPS \u2013 you get access to a premium logistics provider, and that\u2019s a win-win.\n\nLearn more about our work and see what\u2019s next.",

Join the UPS Worker Rank-and-File Committee by filling out the form below.\n\nA UPS driver unloads packages from a truck and arranges them for delivery. [AP Photo/Mark Lennihan]\n\nUPS will close its Swan Island hub in Portland, Oregon, this summer in order to convert it into an automated facility, the Teamsters union confirmed in a local meeting Sunday. The move will impact around 600 people, who still work at the facility.\n\nThis is the latest hub to be closed since the passage of the new Teamsters contract in 2023, which union officials falsely described as a \u201chistoric\u201d victory. In reality, it is a key piece of the company\u2019s so-called \u201cNetwork of the Future\u201d restructuring, which threatens tens of thousands of jobs. Threatening to automate \u201ceverything,\u201d management intends to close or automate 200 facilities under the program, while citing the \u201clabor certainty\u201d of the new contract as key to their plans.\n\nThe contract was passed under false pretenses, following a \u201cstrike-ready\u201d campaign by the Teamsters, which in reality had no intention of striking. This was a public relations stunt designed to present the contract they had worked out with management as the product of \u201chard bargaining.\u201d\n\nOther facilities targeted for closure in recent weeks include hubs in Commerce City, Colorado; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and the Grande Vista hub in Vernon, California.\n\nThe closure of Swan Island was long suspected, with various sources reporting to the WSWS that the move was in the works. The hub was also one of many throughout the country where the company eliminated day sort shifts, affecting hundreds of jobs at this facility alone.\n\nIt is urgent that UPS workers build a rank-and-file movement to force a stop to these closures. The UPS Workers Rank-and-File Committee, built in 2023 to fight the sellout contract, has consistently warned that these layoffs were coming while the Teamsters has maintained a guilty silence.\n\nThe unity of workers around the world is critical to this fight. The closures at UPS are part of a massive worldwide cost-cutting campaign, including the post offices in the US, Canada, Britain and other countries, and in the auto industry and even \u201cwhite collar\u201d industries, such as the technology and film sectors in which automation is being weaponized to destroy jobs.\n\nThe natural allies of UPS workers are workers at the US Postal Service, decimated by restructuring and targeted for privatization under Trump, Canada Post workers who struck for more than a month before the Trudeau government banned the strike, Royal Mail workers in Britain, Amazon workers and other logistics workers around the world who are fighting against the corporate oligarchy.\n\nWorkers must insist that they have the right to take all measures necessary to defend their jobs. This can only be put into practice through a struggle to transfer power out of the hands of the corrupt union officials and into the hands of workers themselves, replacing the bureaucracy with new leadership drawn from the rank and file.\n\nThe bureaucracy\u2019s sole concern is maintaining its corrupt relations with management and with the corporate political parties. Over the holidays, the Teamsters called a nationwide strike at Amazon, which was then shut down after only a few days. While this showed the possibility of a powerful movement uniting UPS, Amazon and other sections of the working class, the Teamsters had called it only to bolster their credibility after massive betrayals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Teamsters bureaucracy and General President Sean O\u2019Brien are close allies of Trump, having de facto endorsed him in the November election. O\u2019Brien has publicly promoted Trump\u2019s racist \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric, falsely presenting attacks on immigrants and trade war measures as being to the benefit of workers in the United States. In reality, this is aimed at covering up the responsibility of the oligarchs in America, assisted by their lackeys in the trade unions, in carrying out mass layoffs.\n\nWorsening conditions at UPS\n\nThe Sunday meeting in Portland, which was little advertised to the wider workforce and sparsely attended (outside of those close to the Teamsters bureaucracy), also confirmed that workers who transferred to other hubs in the region would lose their Market Rate Adjustment (MRA). MRAs are local pay increases, implemented at the discretion of management at individual locations to attract labor when the wages \u201cnegotiated\u201d in the Teamsters contract are too low.\n\nThe fate of MRAs was a major issue in the 2023 contract. While the Teamsters boasted of starting pay increases to $21 per hour for part-time warehouse workers, rising to $23 in 2028, it was unclear whether this could simply be canceled out in many areas by eliminating MRAs which were already at or above that level. Evasive statements at the time by Teamsters officials suggested that this was at the discretion of management.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for this,\u201d one Swan Island worker said.\n\nAnother worker said, \u201cAfter losing day shift I don\u2019t know if I can handle another big change. And now, the union say \u2018oh you\u2019ll still have a job,\u2019 but what kind of job? Loading trailers? In my 50s? After decades here?\u201d\n\nIn addition to the loss of the day shift, management at Swan Island has continuously dwindled down preparation time before shifts from 45 to 20 minutes, which workers now call \u201cpoverty time.\u201d\n\nNationwide, unsafe working conditions are rampant. Last month, a fire ripped through a UPS warehouse in Athens, Tennessee, destroying packages and damaging nearly two dozen delivery vehicles.\n\n\u201cOnce the fire happened, the employees were moved to the Knoxville facility and are working out of a temporary village, and getting all of the packages moved to the Athens area from the Knoxville facility,\u201d the Teamsters Local 519 President told the local station Newschannel 9. \u201cThey\u2019re working 10 to 12 hours, and now they\u2019ve sacrificed, from the Athens facility, to drive an hour away.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the wait for part-timers, the overwhelming majority of the company\u2019s workforce, to move to full-time positions has increased to 7 years to over a decade. The Teamsters had boasted that the new contract would \u201ccreate\u201d 7,500 new full-time jobs, which will be more than offset by the \u201cNetwork of the Future\u201d restructuring, if they ever happen.\n\nThe WSWS spoke to workers at the Maspeth hub in New York City over the holiday season, where workers are sleeping in their cars between split shifts in order to keep their full-time status. \u201cHere it is peak season, and the business volume is insane which makes the work exhausting,\u201d one worker said. \u201cYou just want to finish work and go home and sleep every day. There are drivers coming to our center because we need help, but it is only like 5 people. \u2026 There are workers here working split shifts where one shift ends at 10:30 p.m. and the next starts at 4:00 a.m. Many can\u2019t go home.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get information here about what is happening outside our building. The union should be doing that and keeping us informed about what is going on all over. The union is supposed to represent everybody. But they are playing with workers, like the Combo Helpers. They are not calling them until one hour before their shift starts to tell them where in the city they have go to meet the truck they have to help deliver from.\u201d\n\nWorkers at the hub were disgusted to learn that in Canada, the Teamsters were forcing workers at Purolator to scab on a nationwide Canada Post strike.\n\nOne worker commented, \u201cThat is messed up. It is not what a union is supposed to do. A union is supposed to support striking workers. It sounds corrupt to me.\u201d\n\nAnother said, \u201cI believe the union who scabs doesn\u2019t have the right to speak poorly of any worker choosing to get overtime. The union supporter portion of me makes me disgusted. It\u2019s like looking at an addict being abused by their sponsor and smiling through it.\u201d",

So let\u2019s call that 10%-12% or so. Still, they are some good ones: Zoom, Scaler, New Relic, Elastic, etc.\n\nMore on that here:\n\nBut that\u2019s of SaaS and Cloud companies that IPO\u2019d.

But 38% of bootstrapped start-ups have a solo founder.\n\nWe could draw a lot of conclusions from this, but perhaps the biggest one is if you start something entirely on your own, with no capital at all, you may own almost all of it yourself.

Across the rest of the program there are some other targeted increases with no race scheduled to be run for less than it was in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe King George is obviously a wonderfully iconic race and plays a vital role in the program, particularly in terms of the ever-important middle-distance horse,\u201d said Ruth Quinn, international director at the British Horseracing Authority. \u201cAscot\u2019s run-for-free concept, especially for this extremely valuable prize, is an example of tremendous initiative and dynamic thinking.\n\n\u201cThe ($1.8 million) prize fund, particularly against the backdrop of increasing international competition to entice high-quality runners, is extremely welcome news. The ability for owners to have entry stakes returned and therefore be able to compete in this great race for free shows welcome enterprise and should help to increase the attractiveness of lining up in this event.\u201d\n\nOther race condition changes in 2025 will see the removal of the April entry deadlines for the four Group 2 races at the royal meeting. They include the Ribblesdale, the King Edward VII, the Duke of Cambridge and the Hardwicke. This will enable connections to make later, better-informed decisions about entering and running their horses.\n\nThe combined effect of the prize money increases and race condition changes will see Ascot\u2019s executive contribution to prize money increase from $11.6 million in 2024 to a budgeted $12.5 million in 2025.\n\n\u201cTrainers will certainly appreciate the extra flexibility that converting these Group 2s to becoming normal closers offers,\u201d said Paul Johnson, chief executive of the Great Britain-based National Trainers Federation. \u201cThis will allow for more informed decision-making in the build up to these races and will hopefully see Ascot rewarded with competitive contests. The introduction of run for free for the King George is also a concept that we hope will encourage runners in tandem with the significant increase in prize money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to be continuing our upward trajectory in prize money for 2025, and through changes to entry conditions for the Group 2 races at Royal Ascot and run for free for the King George, we will be absorbing more costs usually paid by owners,\u201d Ascot CEO Felicity Barnard said. \u201cThe King George is our mid-summer highlight and Britain\u2019s top all-aged, mile-and-a-half race. It is vital that its prize money reflects that, and this year\u2019s renewal will be the most valuable race ever run at Ascot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been thinking about the concept of run for free for the King George for some time as a mechanism for incentivizing runners at decision-making time, as there are other alternatives lower down the (group and listed levels) and overseas,\u201d said Nick Smith, Ascot\u2019s director of racing and public affairs. \u201cField sizes are very important, especially in the world-pool era, and we hope that connections of horses that aren\u2019t at the top of the betting might see this as a good reason to go for the big target, especially with record prize money on offer.\n\n\u201cThe four races with historical early closing at the royal meeting will now close at the five-day stage, giving connections more time to identify the right horses for these races with the Epsom classics, Coronation Cup (G1) and such like behind them. Once again, we are ensuring that no race at Ascot will be run for less than the previous year.\u201d\n\nAll figures are planned numbers for 2025 and subject to unforeseen cancellations.",

The 6-foot-3, 227-pound Knies had scored just one goal in his previous 14 games and strayed from his heavy and powerful game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the hardest thing,\u201d McMann said of the pressure to score as a young NHL player. \u201cI\u2019m sure guys that go later in the league have gone through those dips when you know you\u2019re going to come out of it. You listen to (Sidney) Crosby\u2019s interview where he\u2019s like, \u2018Every time you guys ask me about (scoring slumps), that\u2019s when I come out of it.\u2019 Like he\u2019s not even worried at all.\u201d\n\nThe 22-year-old Knies doesn\u2019t have the luxury of that experience. It was fair to wonder whether he could get his production back on track. The Leafs continue to need goals, with their overall production dipping from last season.\n\nBut if Knies was worried, he had no reason to now. With a series of net front and skilled goals in a 6-4 win over the Bruins, Knies notched his first NHL hat trick. The best game of his NHL career came at a time when he needed it.\n\n\u201c(Knies) was a great player tonight,\u201d Leafs head coach Craig Berube said. \u201cHe was just challenging their (defence) with his speed, directness, and shooting. I liked that he just attacked and shot. He wasn\u2019t always looking for the other guys. He was playing his game, which was very effective.\u201d\n\nwhy is this video 5 hours long pic.twitter.com/u1rD1qlVQO \u2014 Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs) January 5, 2025\n\nThe most productive \u2014 and electrifying \u2014 offensive output in Knies\u2019 NHL career is evidence of him learning how to manage the ups and downs of the best league in the world. And it\u2019s further evidence of how much more dangerous the Leafs are when Knies gets on the scoresheet.\n\nKnies began the season on the left side of Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner. Throughout Matthews and Marner\u2019s time playing together, finding a left winger who can keep up with their world-class skill and hockey brains hasn\u2019t always been easy for the Leafs. But Knies\u2019 straight-line game brought a different and necessary element to the line. The Leafs looked to finally have the missing piece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter getting shot out of a cannon to start this season, Knies\u2019 play dipped significantly through an arduous December. The Leafs had 15 games in the month and Knies didn\u2019t look like he could dominate opposition with physicality or his scoring touch. There were shifts when he looked exhausted. Knies\u2019 struggles through December sent him lower down the lineup.\n\nHello, sophomore slump.\n\nHow long would it last? Was Knies\u2019 promising rookie season not necessarily a sign of things to come?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to trust that what you\u2019re doing is right and eventually, your chances will go in,\u201d McMann said of Knies\u2019 efforts to score.\n\nThose chances came and were converted upon on Saturday.\n\nFirst, Knies spun around for a backhand tip goal in the second period that had Knies himself looking stunned. Then, early in the third period, Knies broke the puck out of his own zone, evaded Bruins defender Brandon Carlo and again spun around to deftly stuff a backhand past Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman. Finally, with two Bruins nearby, Knies sniffed out a perfect pass from Matthews behind the net and snapped home his third goal.\n\nAll the goals came where and how Knies should be scoring: directly in front of the net, and with his heavy frame being used as a tool. His second and third goals each gave the Leafs the lead.\n\n\u201cThere was a little bit missing,\u201d Knies said of his slump. \u201cI wasn\u2019t as direct and physical.\u201d\n\nKnies ended up adding two assists, totalled six shots (tied for a career high) and was on the ice for all six Maple Leafs goals.\n\n\u201cI felt the luck more on my side,\u201d Knies said.\n\nIn his return to the lineup after six games out with an undisclosed injury, Matthews looked like his dynamic self. The former Hart Trophy winner moved remarkably well, had a goal and two assists and made multiple physical and defensive plays that nullified injury concerns. Marner himself added a goal and five points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider the Leafs top line, as the kids would say, so back.\n\nBerube will be able to feel confident turning to that line for the foreseeable future in no small part because of Knies.\n\nSaturday night didn\u2019t necessarily feel like Knies\u2019 arrival. This is a player who, after all, looked like born for the postseason just a few weeks after making his NHL debut back in the spring of 2023. All the signs that Knies could be a dominant NHL player were there against the Tampa Bay Lightning that spring and then again a year later when he scored two goals \u2014 second among all Leafs \u2014 in a seven-game series against the Boston Bruins.\n\nBut what Saturday night did feel like was a young player realizing that playing consistently in the NHL isn\u2019t easy. If Knies is going to have a lengthy career, he\u2019s going to have to learn how to manage the ups and downs and the dips in scoring.\n\n\u201cI think as a younger guy, you put more pressure on yourself because you want to hit that high ceiling and you want to reach your potential,\u201d McMann said of Knies.\n\nRemember, the 80 regular season games Knies played last year were more than he had played in the previous two years combined. It felt like managing fatigue and the mental grind of a relentless league would be a challenge for Knies.\n\nIf Knies couldn\u2019t learn to manage the league, elevate his game and carve out a role for himself, what kind of player could he become?\n\nAs he racked up goal after goal Saturday night, we learned what Knies\u2019 potential truly looks like: He has the capabilities to become one of the most dominant power forwards in recent Leafs memory.\n\nBehind the scenes over the last few weeks, Knies studied video and had conversations with the coaching staff about bringing physicality to every shift, putting in second efforts to strip pucks and, above all, getting to the inside of the ice more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s part of the growth Berube has seen from Knies this season.\n\n\u201c(Knies) has become a real good penalty killer for us. He does a great job on the (penalty kill) for us. He made a great play at the end of the game \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you saw it \u2014 where they tried a backdoor play on us with the goalie out. That was just a great read and hockey sense by him to drop down that low and take away that backdoor play, or else that guy scores,\u201d Berube said, referencing the Bruins\u2019 push to score late in the third period. \u201cHis growth as a player is all around, but offensively, he has come out of his shell with scoring. On the other side, he has become a good 200-foot player.\u201d\n\nWhat Knies showed on Saturday is that he can improve and manage the lows that come in the NHL.\n\nIn the future, if he can reference this slump and how to get out of it, Knies could become a more steady offensive player. And that\u2019s the kind of player who could benefit the Leafs in the long term.\n\nKnies is up to 14 goals in 38 games, tied for third on the Leafs. His slump is in the rearview mirror. And the next stage of his season could take him and the Leafs to new heights.\n\n\u201c(Knies) looks more comfortable, more adapted to the game, the speed,\u201d McMann said. \u201cAnd I think that shows. His game has been more like a power forward and aggressive player that he showed capabilities of many times last season, and he\u2019s doing it more consistently this season.\u201d\n\n(Photo: John E.

            "content": "Review by Daz Gale\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nThe Christmas break is over and 2025 is kicking off with the first new shows opening. First out the doors and our first theatre review of the year is the debut of satirical comedy Higher Ups, taking over the Old Red Lion Theatre in Islington for a few days this January. With an intriguing premise and a promise to be a riotous comedy, would this start the year off strong and prove to be a theatrical high?\n\n\n\n\n\nSet in a top talent agency, the pressurised situation of their annual \u201cBig Daddy\u201d meeting takes an unexpected turn when their boss and mogul Brian Douglas turns up late claiming he has been abducted by \u201chigher beings\u201d. With long-suffering employee Daisy having to deal with co-worker Samuel already on the edge, new employee Natasha having the most eventful first day at work ever and Glynn, a random man who found Brian and has no business being there, this is anything but a normal day at work. The question is how can they stop this day descending into chaos and ruining the legacy of their agency and, most importantly, their bonuses.\n\nThere is a lot to unpack in Higher Ups and that is part of the problem itself. The plot becomes convoluted with too many strands, never quite fully developed and extreme changes happening at rapid speed, never allowing the story to fully breathe. The frustration is there is a good story in here and it has plenty of potential but it feels drastically undercooked with uneven writing that shows promise at times but falters at others. Tonally, it feels a bit all over the place, eventually settling for a dark comedy but with an extremely dark shift that hasn\u2019t been set up in the right way so comes across too jarring. Crucially, and one of my biggest issues with the play, it advertises itself as a comedy yet I didn\u2019t find it very funny aside from a couple of moments that raised a smile \u2013 I sat in that theatre ready to split my sides from laughter and it didn\u2019t even gain a chuckle. Of course theatre is subjective and I did note laughter from fellow audience members, though this noticeably subsided as the play progressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also no way to sugarcoat this \u2013 Higher Ups is a weird show, but I believe that was the intent. An acting agency seemingly being overtaken by the instructions of aliens following an abduction is hardly going to be the most subtle of shows, but it becomes a bit too tough to swallow at times. It also thinks it\u2019s a lot funnier than it is with the scenes of Brian listening to a tin of Baked Beans not quite the can of hilarity it hopes to be (though I have to give credit for the ultimate payoff regarding that). Yes, this is meant to be satirical but this satire needed to have layers to it and that was lacking. It\u2019s not as if aliens taking over an acting agency is beyond the realms of possibility \u2013 for all I know it\u2019s already happened. That would certainly explain a lot anyway. It just didn\u2019t play out as naturally as you would hope in a story like this, which becomes messier and harder to identify as it progresses.\n\nThe direction also felt flawed throughout. While the play was clearly bigger than the extremely limited space the theatre had to offer, the multiple rooms, corridors and doors (meaning they were off stage for too much time) minimised impact and caused problems with sightlines in a production that hadn\u2019t been thought through as meticulously as expected. One pivotal moment was only noticeable by a couple of audience members due to the positioning of two of the characters in the audience itself \u2013 simply moving them to the other side of the stage so that the whole audience could clock this key moment would have been the simplest touch but one I believe would have made the moment more impactful.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cast of five also proved uneven, though I believe this is more to do with the limitations and complications in the writing than their talents. A couple of them did make the best of the situation and attempted to elevate the material with notably the two female characters, Daisy and Natasha, played by Alice Marshall and Gemma Casely-Kirk, delivering the strongest performances. One of the other characters felt incredibly miscast though in a performance that wasn\u2019t so much a caricature but felt as if he was appearing in a different play altogether with not a single nuance to be found.\n\nA note from the writer and director talks of the play\u2019s aims to satirise untouchable men and reclaim the power by laughing at them, putting the womens voices first in male dominated workplaces. It is certainly admirable and I see the irony in having to criticise this in my review. However, I feel their intentions didn\u2019t translate to the stage as well as they could and whatever basic premise and hope they had for Higher Ups somehow got lost along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a tricky review to write and not the way I wanted to kick off the year. Higher Ups grabbed my attention from its description, feeling very much like my kind of show. Though this is a two star review, it is not to say that it isn\u2019t without its potential. On the contrary, this is a show that definitely has something to it and I could see it progressing to a higher life once it finds its voice. However, it still needs to workshop itself and develop to pull together all the elements and create one cohesive narrative in order to get there. I do hope there is a further life for this show, however, and will be keen to observe where it goes from here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher Ups plays at the Old Red Lion Theatre until 4th January.

You couldn't move for the Netflix chat on this week's SmackDown, but it's puzzling how much of an issue that seems to be for some on social media. Why is anyone pointing fingers at the company for promoting their own products? What's the alternative? That they...don't? That wouldn't make much sense.\n\nCeaseless Netflix hype wasn't one of the show's problems anyway. Being honest, the blue brand didn't have too many on Friday (some of the 'Downs' featured here are fairly minor and could be one fan jumping the gun by looking into things waaaay too much). It was a solid episode with one huge moment that'll get everyone talking. The future of women's wrestling arrived in style on Friday, put it that way.\n\nWWE waved goodbye to the two hour format on last week's broadcast, so there's a bit more to highlight from this three hour special. On that, it's keeping things \"special\" that'll be one of Triple H's objectives in coming weeks and months. Nothing is certain there, but WrestleMania season should help a lot.\n\nStar power wasn't threadbare. Cody Rhodes, Kevin Owens, Drew McIntyre, Sami Zayn, The Usos and Solo Sikoa's Bloodline all worked various segments and matches for the live crowd.

This tiny archipelago, closer to Beijing\u2019s territory than Taipei\u2019s, has become the latest chess piece in an increasingly complex power game.\n\nOn the final day of 2024, Coast Guard vessels from China\u2019s Fujian Province conducted patrols in waters near Taiwan\u2019s Kinmen Island. China described these operations as routine law enforcement activities conducted within its established legal framework.\n\nHowever, Taiwan\u2019s Coast Guard had a different perspective. They reported that, since February 2024, Chinese Coast Guard ships breached waters near Taiwan\u2019s outlying Kinmen Islands a record 52 times, marking a sharp escalation.\n\nThis surge is seen as part of Beijing\u2019s broader \u201cgray-zone warfare\u201d strategy\u2014an ongoing campaign of non-military tactics designed to intimidate Taiwan without provoking outright conflict.\n\nThe situation began heating up earlier last year when two Chinese fishermen drowned during a chase by Taiwan\u2019s Coast Guard near Kinmen\u2019s northernmost islands. In retaliation, China ramped up its Coast Guard operations in the region, accusing Taiwan of harassment and further complicating an already tense maritime standoff.\n\nSince then, Kinmen has become a hotspot for heightened law enforcement activity as both sides monitor the contested maritime borders.\n\nWhy Kinmen Belongs To Taiwan Despite Its Proximity to China\n\nKinmen, a tiny archipelago located less than 10 kilometers off the coast of China\u2019s Xiamen in Fujian Province, is governed by Taiwan but remains a focal point of geopolitical tension.\n\nRecently, it has re-emerged as a strategic flashpoint in the China-Taiwan-US triangle, drawing renewed global attention.\n\nMany are puzzled by Kinmen\u2019s status, given its proximity to China and its location near Xiamen, a bustling Chinese city of over five million people. However, Kinmen\u2019s current status is rooted in the complex history of the Chinese Civil War.\n\nInitially seized by Japan in 1937 from the Republic of China/ROC (not the same as Taiwan, but the state of China that existed from 1912 to 1949), Kinmen returned to ROC control after World War II.\n\nWhen the Chinese Civil War concluded in 1949, the Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) forces under Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan after losing mainland China to Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist forces. However, the KMT chose to fortify Kinmen and Matsu instead of abandoning them, recognizing their strategic importance.\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) tried twice to capture Kinmen, first during the Battle of Guningtou in 1949 and later in 1950, but despite the numerical advantage, it failed due to poor planning. These defeats ensured Kinmen remained under the control of the ROC.\n\nWith time, Kinmen became a symbol of Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty\u2014a token of resistance in the face of Beijing\u2019s ever-expanding ambitions.\n\nXi Jinping\u2019s Push For Reunification\n\nIn a defiant New Year\u2019s address, Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed his view that Taiwan\u2019s reunification with China is inevitable. \u201cThe people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. No one can sever our bonds, and no one can halt the historical momentum of national reunification,\u201d he declared, signaling his determination to bring Taiwan under Beijing\u2019s control.\n\nThis rhetoric and escalating military pressure have only intensified tensions in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, reports from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) reveal a surge in Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) incursions into Taiwan\u2019s surrounding waters, including Kinmen and Matsu. From May 2020 to September 2024, the number of Chinese vessels entering these restricted waters reached an all-time high.\n\nThe frequency of these incursions underscores Beijing\u2019s strategy to assert its dominance in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nKinmen: A Symbol Of Taiwan\u2019s Resistance\n\nAmid these rising tensions, Taiwan\u2019s President Lai Ching-te visited Kinmen Island in August 2024 to commemorate the 66th anniversary of the second Taiwan Strait crisis, a pivotal clash with Chinese forces.\n\nIn his address, Lai reaffirmed Taiwan\u2019s commitment to peaceful development but also declared, \u201cWe refuse to be ruled by the Communist Party and are committed to continuing a life of democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nDespite its proximity to China, Kinmen remains a key symbol of Taiwan\u2019s resistance to Beijing\u2019s pressure.\n\nHowever, some Kinmen residents have a more nuanced view. According to Voice of America (VOA) \u2013 the largest U.S. international broadcaster funded by the U.S. government, most residents of Kinmen feel safer on China\u2019s doorstep than they would on Taiwan\u2019s main island.\n\nMany Kinmen locals have supported the idea of a bridge connecting Xiamen to their island, viewing it as a symbol of peace that could boost the economy and strengthen cross-strait ties.\n\nYet, Taiwan\u2019s government has strongly opposed the plan, citing national security risks\u2014a stance that Kinmen residents find frustrating.\n\nA Microcosm Of Broader US-China Rivalry\n\nKinmen\u2019s strategic value has drawn heightened attention as the US counters China\u2019s regional assertiveness. The Biden administration\u2019s focus on deterring Beijing\u2019s ambitions in the Taiwan Strait has placed islands like Kinmen under the spotlight.\n\nIn February 2024, a Newsweek article revealed for the first time that U.S. special forces troops would be stationed permanently in Taiwan rather than on a temporary or rotational basis. In March 2024, Taiwan\u2019s Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng confirmed the presence of U.S. Army Special Forces personnel on Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands, including in Kinmen.\n\nKinmen\u2019s increasing prominence clearly indicates the region\u2019s volatile nature, underscoring the fragility of peace in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe waters around Kinmen, once a serene path for ferries and trade, have become a high-stakes battleground for regional stability. In the broader U.S.-China-Taiwan triangle, this small island has evolved into a critical barometer for peace, where every wave could ripple out with far-reaching consequences.",

Even though the current reported plans suggest that we could see Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes taking on John Cena, it is stated that this could change depending on what The Rock wants to do at the big show. Previously, it was believed that The Rock would be the one facing Rhodes at WrestleMania with both the Undisputed WWE Championship and The Rock\u2019s personal \u2018People\u2019s Championship\u2019 on the line.\n\nMeltzer explains that The Rock will have a prominent role at WrestleMania if he wants to be there, and that the upcoming premiere of Monday Night RAW on Netflix could tease what he will be up to. Earlier this month it was reported that The Rock was indeed planned to appear on RAW\u2019s Netlfix debut on January 6.\n\nSign up to the Cultaholic Wrestling Newsletter now",

The rumors surrounding this matchup escalated following The Rock\u2019s surprise appearance at WWE Bad Blood 2024.\n\nThe premiere episode of WWE RAW on Netflix is scheduled for January 6 at the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles, and The Rock is expected to appear on the show.\n\nAccording to The Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the belief is that The Rock will appear at WrestleMania 41, although it remains unclear what his exact role will be.\n\nThe report states, \u201cAt first it was the Raw title given Rhodes vs. Rock would be for the other title and People\u2019s belt.

            "content": "Results from the British COLO-DETECT trial add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-aided colonoscopy to increase premalignant colorectal polyp detection in routine colonoscopy practice.\n\nColin J. Rees, a professor of gastroenterology in the Faculty of Medical Sciences at Newcastle University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and colleagues compared the real-world clinical effectiveness of computer-aided detection (CADe)-assisted colonoscopy using an \u201cintelligent\u201d module with that of standard colonoscopy in a study in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology.\n\nThey found the GI Genius Intelligent Endoscopy Module (Medtronic Inc.) increased the mean number of adenomas detected per procedure and the adenoma detection rate, especially for small, flat (type 0-IIa) polyps, and sessile serrated lesions, which are more likely to be missed.\n\n\u201cMissed sessile serrated lesions disproportionately increase the risk of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer, thus the adoption of GI Genius into routine colonoscopy practice could not only increase polyp detection but also reduce the incidence of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer,\u201d the investigators wrote.\n\n\u201cAI is going to have a major impact upon most aspects of healthcare. Some areas of medical practice are now well established, and some are still in evolution,\u201d Prof Rees, who is also president of the British Society of Gastroenterology, said in an interview. \u201cWithin gastroenterology, the role of AI in endoscopic diagnostics is also evolving. The COLO-DETECT trial demonstrates that AI increases detection of lesions, and work is ongoing to see how AI might help with characterization and other elements of endoscopic practice.\u201d\n\nStudy Details\n\nThe multicenter, open-label, parallel-arm, pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted at 12 National Health Service hospitals in England. The study cohort consisted of adults \u2265 18 years undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening or colonoscopy for gastrointestinal symptom surveillance owing to personal or family history.\n\nRecruiting staff, participants, and colonoscopists were unmasked to allocation, whereas histopathologists, cochief investigators, and trial statisticians were masked.\n\nCADe-assisted colonoscopy consisted of standard colonoscopy plus the GI Genius module active for at least the entire inspection phase of colonoscope withdrawal.\n\nThe primary outcome was mean adenomas per procedure (total number of adenomas detected divided by total number of procedures). The key secondary outcome was adenoma detection rate (proportion of colonoscopies with at least one adenoma).\n\nFrom March 2021 to April 2023, the investigators recruited 2032 participants, 55.7% men, with a mean cohort age of 62.4 years and randomly assigned them to CADe-assisted colonoscopy (n = 1015) or to standard colonoscopy (n = 1017). Of these, 60.6% were undergoing screening and 39.4% had symptomatic indications.\n\nMean adenomas per procedure were 1.56 (SD, 2.82; n = 1001 participants with data) in the CADe-assisted group vs 1.21 (n = 1009) in the standard group, for an adjusted mean difference of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.14-0.57; adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15-1.47; P < .0001).\n\nAdenomas were detected in 555 (56.6%) of 980 participants in the CADe-assisted group vs 477 (48.4%) of 986 in the standard group, representing a proportion difference of 8.3% (95% CI, 3.9-12.7; adjusted odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.21-1.78; P < .0001).\n\nAs to safety, adverse events were numerically comparable in both the intervention and control groups, with overall events 25 vs 19 and serious events 4 vs 6. On independent review, no adverse events in the CADe-assisted colonoscopy group were related to GI Genius.\n\nOffering a US perspective on the study, Nabil M. Mansour, MD, an associate professor and director of the McNair General GI Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said GI Genius and other CADe systems represent a significant advance over standard colonoscopy for identifying premalignant polyps. \u201cWhile the data have been mixed, most studies, particularly randomized controlled trials have shown significant improvements with CADe in detection both terms of in adenomas per colonoscopy and reductions in adenoma miss rate,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nHe added that the main utility of CADe is for asymptomatic patients undergoing average-risk screening and surveillance colonoscopy for CRC screening and prevention, as well as for those with positive stool-based screening tests, \u201cthough there is no downside to using it in symptomatic patients as well.\u201d Though AI colonoscopy likely still stands at < 50% of endoscopy centers overall, and is used mainly at academic centers, his clinic has been using it for the past year.\n\nThe main question, Mansour cautioned, is whether increased detection of small polyps will actually reduce CRC incidence or mortality, and it will likely be several years before clear, concrete data can answer that.\n\n\u201cMost studies have shown the improvement in adenoma detection is mainly for diminutive polyps < 5 mm in diameter, but whether that will actually translate to substantive improvements in hard outcomes is as yet unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if gastroenterologists are interested in doing everything they can today to help improve detection rates and lower miss rates of premalignant polyps, serious consideration should be given to adopting the use of CADe in practice.\u201d\n\nThis study was supported by Medtronic Inc.\n\nRees reported receiving grant funding from ARC Medical, Norgine, Medtronic, 3-D Matrix, and Olympus Medical, and has been an expert witness for ARC Medical. Other authors disclosed receiving research funding, honoraria, or travel expenses from Medtronic or other private companies.\n\nMansour had no competing interests to declare.",

Given what he was seeing among clients of his home health business \u2014 who often complained about unreliable rides \u2014 the need seemed obvious. But would-be competitors protested, backed by laws that give them sway over new entrants to the market. Though state regulators determined N\u2019da was qualified to run a medical transport operation, they denied his application because he hadn\u2019t demonstrated it would be \u201charmless\u201d to the businesses that had come before him.\n\nN\u2019da responded with a lawsuit accusing the state of denying him due process. The case is now before the Nebraska Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nN\u2019da is part of a wave of litigants pressing to dismantle regulations that plaintiff lawyers say have fomented health care \u201ccartels\u201d in more than 30 states \u2014 limiting, for example, the number of methadone clinics in West Virginia, youth mental health beds in Arkansas and MRI centers in North Carolina.\n\nThese certificate-of-need (CON) laws require certain health care and transportation businesses to demonstrate community need for their services before they can operate. The prerequisite is meant to contain costs and prevent oversaturation of the market, but it often comes with a catch: Would-be competitors can challenge applicants whose services could cut into their sales.\n\n\u201cIt creates these little fiefdoms,\u201d said William Aronin, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, the libertarian law firm representing N\u2019da. \u201cNo one benefits but the incumbents.\u201d\n\nHealth care officials say the rules create a crucial buffer in a system not governed by the usual tenets of a free-market economy. Hospitals must care for emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay. The government sets payment rates for patients on public insurance programs. Commercially insured patients and specialty services help subsidize those losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf an ambulatory surgical center set up shop next to a rural hospital, \u201cit can cherry-pick the patients that it wants,\u201d said David Dirr, a lawyer who has represented the Kentucky Hospital Association.\n\nMany health care facilities already can\u2019t hire enough workers; without CON laws, proponents say, resources could be spread too thin to fully support any one hospital. About 1 in 5 nursing jobs are vacant in West Virginia.\n\n\u201cI get a kick when I hear some people say, \u2018Well, if you get rid of CON in West Virginia, you\u2019re going to have all these additional hospital beds,\u2019\u201d said Jim Kaufman, president and chief executive of the state\u2019s hospital association.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t staff all the beds that we\u2019re licensed for today.\u201d\n\nWhy not \u2018something better\u2019?\n\nThe federal government in the 1970s pushed states to adopt certificate-of-need laws to give health care planners more control over how resources were allocated. But officials in seven consecutive presidential administrations starting with Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency have criticized certificate regulations as anticompetitive or too easily manipulated by businesses interested in protecting their own bottom lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCongress did away with CON mandates by 1987, and more than a dozen states have eliminated their certificate requirements since then. But most state governments have kept them, with hospital groups and businesses that already have certificates urging lawmakers to maintain the status quo.\n\nAmy Summers, a former emergency room nurse and House majority leader in West Virginia, said she repeatedly tried to roll back the state\u2019s CON law before leaving office this month. \u201cThe lobby is just too strong to get it done,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2024, Kentucky lawmakers considered scaling back the state\u2019s CON law after residents in several northern counties complained they had only one hospital system from which to choose, prompting them to drive to Ohio if they didn\u2019t like the care there. That bill didn\u2019t pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Oregon\u2019s House of Representatives, a bill introduced in February was supported by some residents and doctors, who said a lack of mental health and rehabilitation beds forced patients to seek treatment out of state.\n\nLaura Core, a resident of Portland, Oregon, stayed in one of those in-state rehabilitation beds after she sustained severe brain and spinal cord injuries in a 2022 car crash. She said some of the therapies she received, such as spending time in a garden and making cookies, were ineffective.\n\n\u201cWhy do we not have something better?\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the law that is preventing that from happening.\u201d\n\nThe Oregon bill never made it out of committee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndustry groups in Oregon and Kentucky have said certificate laws play an important oversight role and that their facilities outperform those in non-CON states.\n\nOther states have seen legal challenges on constitutional grounds; cases are pending in Mississippi, North Carolina and Nebraska.\n\nAmong them is a lawsuit filed by Charles Slaughter, a physical therapist who tried to open a home-health business in Mississippi in 2020. But the state has a moratorium on new certificates for such enterprises; it hasn\u2019t issued one for more than four decades. The number of Mississippi home health patients quadrupled from 1981 to 2020, the most recent year for which state data is available. Meanwhile, the number of home health agencies dropped by two-thirds during that time, according to state documents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlaughter\u2019s only option would be to buy a certificate of need from another company, he said. But the cost is prohibitive: The last time he considered that route two decades ago, it would have cost over $1 million, he said. Application fees for a certificate of need in Mississippi can reach $25,000.\n\nSlaughter\u2019s attorney, Aaron Rice, likened the certificates to taxi medallions that now prevent small businesses from operating in certain markets. \u201cThere\u2019s literally only one Mississippi-family-owned home health agency left in the state,\u201d he said. A decision by a Mississippi district court is pending.\n\nA Mississippi health department spokesperson said the agency can\u2019t comment on pending litigation. A spokesperson for the Mississippi Association for Home Care said its facilities perform better than peers in states without CON laws, according to federal standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, North Carolina ophthalmologist Jay Singleton sued the state after discovering he couldn\u2019t apply for a certificate to perform cataract surgeries at his New Bern clinic because the state had already decided there was no need. Since 2007 or earlier, regulators haven\u2019t seen a need for new surgical centers within a roughly 1,800-square-mile area that includes the city of 32,000, according to state documents.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even get in the door to apply,\u201d Singleton said.\n\nQuestion of need\n\nWhen Nebraska began requiring medical transport companies to secure certificates in 2002, state and local health officials opposed to the idea said it would limit the market to big companies \u201cwho can afford the lawyers to fight for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe concern proved prescient, said Crystal Rhoades, who served on the state\u2019s Public Service Commission from 2015 to 2023. While she was in office, Nebraska\u2019s medical transport industry was dominated by a handful of companies that frequently contested applications, according to Rhoades and exhibits attached to N\u2019da\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe always had the same issue,\u201d the former regulator said. \u201cThe applicant would come in and say, \u2018There\u2019s a need, there\u2019s an unmet need.\u2019 And the existing carriers would say, \u2018No, there isn\u2019t, and we can handle it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Nebraska certificate at issue in N\u2019da\u2019s case is for medical transportation companies that want to drive patients in government programs such as Medicaid.\n\nHalf the applications submitted from 2015 to mid-2022 were contested by one of four companies, according to filings in N\u2019da\u2019s lawsuit. Of the 39 challenged, only one won approval as submitted; 16 advanced after making certain concessions, such as staying out of large cities or limiting the number of handicap-accessible vehicles in their fleet, the lawsuit documents said.\n\nN\u2019da said he was presented with a similar offer: Stay out of Lincoln, Omaha and Bellevue \u2014 the state\u2019s three largest cities \u2014 and the established companies would drop their opposition. N\u2019da described his reaction at a 2023 court hearing.\n\n\u201c\u2018What they\u2019re offering me is unheard of,\u2019\u201d N\u2019da recalled telling state regulators. \u201c\u2018They don\u2019t want competition.\u2019\u201d\n\nN\u2019da said he decided to start a medical transport business after hearing complaints from customers of his home health companies; they said existing options often ran late or didn\u2019t wait for clients whose appointments went longer than expected. The lack of reliability was particularly problematic for people with hard-to-reschedule or can\u2019t-miss appointments, like for dialysis, N\u2019da said in court testimony.\n\nBut N\u2019da didn\u2019t prove that there was sufficient need for his services or that his company would be \u201charmless\u201d to established players, regulators wrote in denying his application.\n\n\u201cImagine if I want to open a restaurant, but the existing restaurant(s) have to decide my fate,\u201d N\u2019da said during the 2023 hearing.\n\nN\u2019da\u2019s case was heard by the Nebraska Supreme Court in December. A decision is pending.\n\nOf the four companies that contested N\u2019da\u2019s application, one appears to no longer offer medical transport and could not be reached for comment. A representative for two others \u2014 sister companies Camelot Transportation and Triumph Transportation \u2014 said their protest was mainly about whether N\u2019da\u2019s small operation had the resources to serve the entire state, as he was proposing, and whether his service filled a need.\n\nCamelot and Triumph do not oppose competition and haven\u2019t protested many applications in recent years, said managing director and owner Alissa Kern.\n\nBut \u201cwe can\u2019t all be carriers, or else none of us are going to survive,\u201d she said.\n\nKirby Young, who until 2019 owned the fourth challenger to N\u2019da, also views Nebraska\u2019s certificate rules as anticompetitive. He bought a cab company in the early 2000s in an attempt to break into the market, he said. He later applied for medical transport certification.\n\nHis brother and sister had worked for a cab company and told Young they couldn\u2019t start their own.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Why not? This is America. You can do whatever you want,\u2019\u201d Young recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018No, not in the state of Nebraska.\u2019\u201d\n\nCompetition and cost\n\nResearch is mixed on whether states\u2019 certificate requirements make health care more expensive.\n\nBecause medical charges are often set by insurers or the government, hospitals typically don\u2019t compete on price, said Steven Ullmann, director of the University of Miami\u2019s Center for Health Management and Policy. Rather, they try to entice patients with upgraded facilities or cutting-edge services, such as new cancer treatments or robotic surgeries.\n\nThat can actually drive up costs, Ullmann said, because there\u2019s an incentive to use new technologies in lieu of cheaper alternatives to justify their purchase \u2014 similar to running a CAT scan if an X-ray will do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a result of overcapitalization and duplication\u201d of expensive services, he said.\n\nThe cost and complexity of the application process itself \u2014 and the threat of an administrative fight with incumbents \u2014 are often enough to repel new or small businesses, say opponents of certificate requirements.\n\nWest Virginia state Del. Evan Worrell (R) said that even though the state granted a certificate of need to a personal-care business he operates, he has spent more than $100,000 in an ongoing legal battle because rival senior centers raised objections that landed him in the state\u2019s Intermediate Court of Appeals.\n\nWorrell said he filled out eight applications in 2023, each to work in a few counties. He had to print two sets of each 150-page application, put some in binders with tab separators, and drop them off at two government offices. More than 18 months later, he\u2019s still waiting for a decision.\n\nGailyn Markham, a spokesperson for the West Virginia Department of Health, said that the state\u2019s CON program is less restrictive than those in other states and that the regulatory agency \u201cprides itself on its commitment to provide cost-effective health care.\u201d\n\nEven if the state ultimately approves a large percentage of applications, the process deters potential participants, Worrell said.",

            "content": "A 35-year-old dad and influencer has officially completed his years-long goal of doing 1 million push-ups \u2014 all while documenting his fitness journey on social media.\n\nKnown as \"The Push Up Guy\" on both Instagram and TikTok, Kevin Cullum first began tracking his push-ups in 2015, telling Good Morning America he started when he heard a coworker talk about their own fitness experience.\n\nThe dad of two launched an Instagram account in 2017 \u2014 @1_millionpushups \u2014 which now boasts over 1,400 posts with inspirational messaging, fitness tips and overall encouragement from Cullum to his 131,000 followers.\n\nOn TikTok, the dad has over 58,000 followers, with his most popular video sitting at 1.6 million views. As he told the outlet, he's \"trying to really motivate and inspire and pump people up and to go after big things in their own lives.\"\n\nOn Dec. 29, after about a decade of his efforts on-and-off social media, Cullum did his 1 millionth push-up next to his son while his wife, Molly, filmed the moment behind the camera.\n\nWith just 10 push-ups left, the influencer shared a speech full of thank you's \u2014 to members of his family and to \"anybody listening,\" who he said can \"accomplish whatever you want in life.\" Cullum then dropped to the floor at their home, alongside his son, and cranked out his final 10 push-ups by his side.\n\n\"I love my two kids and my baby on the way. Much of the reason I did this was because I lack many skills and smarts in life, but I wanted to show that you can accomplish anything if you work hard enough for a long enough period of time,\" he captioned the clip.\n\n\"Finally, to anyone else still reading \u2014 you struggle with things just like I struggle with things. We all do. Do not quit,\" he added. \"Do not surrender. Keep pushing forward, and you will get to where you want to be.\"\n\nPer GMA, Cullum launched his Instagram account as he was approaching his 100,000th push-up.\n\nAt the start, Cullum shared, he wanted to break the world record for the most push-ups done in an hour. And while that didn't work out, he eventually began to consider the new goal of 1 million \u2014 calling the push-ups a metaphor \"to represent so many other things in life.\"\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"Because I thought the message could be much more impactful for anybody on earth,\" he told GMA. \"If you just stick with something for a long enough period of time, you can accomplish massive things.\"\n\nCullum's efforts on social media haven't just been limited to push-up talk, either. He's also been open about his struggles with anxiety, and told GMA that his \"push-up pursuit\" reminded him that he is \"in control.\"\n\n\"The belief inside me was always there, that maybe this can impact someone, maybe this can inspire somebody to go after whatever it is that they want in their life, because we only have one life,\" he said.\n\n\"And push-ups are just the vehicle to trying to get those messages across,\" Cullum continued.\n\n",

            "content": "One Kentucky UPS driver got a very special delivery days before Christmas in the form of a $50,000 Powerball win. The win was announced on December 30, according to a press release.\n\nThe release stated that Jeffery Goree, a UPS employee and Lexington resident, picked up the winning ticket during his commute to Berkley, West Virginia after purchasing multiple tickets.\n\nLottery officials reported that Goree told them that he has been a long-time player and also plays with a group that buys into the Mega Millions. It was stated by the release that Goree purchased the ticket at Clark\u2019s Pump-N-Shop on Versailles Road in Lexington on Dec. 14.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nAccording to the release, it was several days before Goree managed to take the ticket to a nearby convenience store to get them checked. The man stated that it was then that he realized that he had won.\n\n\u201cI was checking them. I had about 15 tickets to check and was down to the last two tickets,\u201d Goree told the lottery, per the release. \u201cIt showed, \u2018Congratulations, you won $50,000, contact KLC Corp.\u2019 I said, \u2018Man this machine is messed up.\u2019 I scanned it again. I\u2019m like, \u2018Nah, this machine is messed up.\u2019\u201d\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAll I could do was stand there and cry,\u201d the Lexington man said once an employee confirmed that the machine was, in fact, not lying. To win the lotto game, the players must select five balls along with a red Powerball. The player must then guess the correct combination of numbers. The game includes quick pick multipliers and a double-play additional game, and players can have their ticket numbers randomly generated.\n\nIt was reported by officials that Goree claimed his prize at the lottery\u2019s Louisville headquarters a few days before Christmas, taking home a check for $36,000 after taxes. \u201cI would give this money up if I could get just one more Christmas with my mother,\u201d he said to lottery officials. According to the man, his mother had been a fan of scratch-off tickets.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cI would usually be getting scratch-off tickets, so I\u2019ll go in here and check these tickets.\u201d The man stated that he plans to use the winnings to pay off some debts and then save the rest. The store that sold the ticket is also a winner, getting a $500 bonus.\n\nThe discovery comes after an Indiana couple received the biggest present this Christmas when they discovered that they were the lucky winners of Powerball's $1 million grand prize mere hours before the prize was set to expire.\n\nImage: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nA release issued by the Hoosier Lottery official reported that the couple from Kendallville arrived at the Hoosier Lottery Prize Payment Office in downtown Indianapolis just five hours before their winning ticket was set to expire.\n\nThe couple \u2014who was not named in the release as they chose to remain anonymous \u2014 found their winning ticket between the seats of their car early Christmas morning. According to the winners, they had seen news coverage of the lottery on the news and scrambled to find their ticket but never found it.",

            "content": "Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of United Parcel Service, Inc. ( NYSE:UPS ) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nThe US$149 analyst price target for UPS is 11% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$7.3b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (6.7%\u2013 2.6%) = US$184b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$184b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$96b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$143b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$126, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\n\nNYSE:UPS Discounted Cash Flow January 1st 2025\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Parcel Service as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.988. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for United Parcel Service\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nDividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

            "content": "The Georgia Bulldogs will begin their play-off run tonight against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the Allstate Sugar Bowl. The Bulldogs are coming off of a much-needed three weeks of rest following a gritty 22-19 overtime win against the Texas Longhorns in the SEC championship, earning them a first-round bye in the playoffs. As for the Irish, they began their playoff play a little over a week ago against the Indiana Hoosiers. Notre Dame dominated the Hoosiers throughout the game for the 27-17 win, as they were the more physical and overall better team. Tonight\u2019s game has a scheduled viewing time of 8:45 p.m. ET, with kickoff likely taking place at 9:00. Buckle up, Dawg fans; it's going to be a late night.\n\nGunner Stockton vs. Notre Dame defense\n\nGunner Stockton will make his first collegiate start tonight for the Dawgs as the Redshirt Sophomore will take over for the injured Carson Beck for the rest of the season. Stockton showcased his toughness and capabilities in the second half of the SEC championship following Beck\u2019s injury, leading the Dawgs to the come from behind win. Other than the late-game interception, Stockton played a heck of a game, using his arm and legs to make crucial plays for the Georgia offense. Throughout the second half, it was apparent that the rest of the Dawgs\u2019 offense was elevating their game, with many players stepping up and rallying around Stockton to get the win.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s offense should look slightly different, with Stockton now at the helm. The Dawgs will likely avoid trying to aggressively push the ball downfield, putting Stockton in a position to take what the defense gives him. Stockton should lean heavily on his tight ends and running backs, with both position groups having true playmakers, as we should also see more rollouts and quarterback runs.\n\nIn terms of the Notre Dame defense, Stockton will have his work cut out for him. The Irish defense is one of the best in the country, as they pride themselves on physicality. The Notre Dame defense ranks 3rd in Opponent Points Per Game with an average of 13.8 points given up while also ranking 4th in Opponent Yards Per Play with 4.4. While the Irish have a solid d-line, it's their linebackers and secondary that really lead the charge for this group. Led by linebacker Jack Kiser and safety Xavier Watts, this defense has been a quarterback\u2019s nightmare all season long, ranking within the top three in Opponent Completion Percentage and Opponent Pass Yards Per Play.\n\nNotre Dame Offense vs. Georgia Defense\n\nThe Notre Dame offense is a group that also prides itself on physicality. Unfortunately for them, the Dawgs defense feels the same way. Senior quarterback Riley Leonard leads the Irish offense; Leonard has totaled 2,293 yards through the air with 17 touchdowns and six interceptions. While Leonard is a solid passer, he is very athletic for a quarterback of his frame as he is an impressive runner, totaling 751 yards on the ground with 15 touchdowns.\n\nLeonard isn\u2019t the only threat for this Georgia defense; Sophomore running back Jeremiah Love will also look to trouble this Dawgs\u2019 team. Love has totaled 1,057 rushing yards on 142 carries for the season, averaging 7.2 yards per carry.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s D-line and linebackers will have to step up against an excellent Notre Dame O-line, as whoever wins the trenches wins this game. Expect leaders of this defense, such as Malaki Starks, Dan Jackson, Mykel Williams, and Butkus Award winner Jalon Walker, to have this defense ready to play.\n\nPrediction UGA-24 Notre Dame-21\n\nI expect this one to be close as both teams are physical and will lean heavily on their defenses while being very methodical on offense. As mentioned earlier, the trenches will be where this game is won. Georgia\u2019s O-line has to get the run game going early in order to take pressure off Stockton. Stockton has to stay composed in the pocket and take what the defense gives him while avoiding turnovers, as his decision-making will be a major factor in Georgia\u2019s offensive success. Georgia\u2019s defense has to limit the Irish run game, putting more pressure on Leonard to make throws while keeping his legs at bay. With that being said, I think we\u2019re in for a classic. As always, Go Dawgs!!!",

            "content": "Yohji Yamamoto\u2019s half-century in fashion has seen him redefine the fabric of his art. His Paris debut, in 1981, with Rei Kawakubo, deconstructed prevailing notions of western femininity. His subsequent, increasingly introspective collections have broken ground in the relationship between garment and body. A gifted musician, his shows are often accompanied by his own musical scores, and sometimes performances.\n\nIn his cloistered attic office above the Paris headquarters, days after the presentation and just before his 81st birthday, Yohji-san described the tenets of his philosophy. Curious and contemplative, with a wicked wit, the designer traced the contours of his creative life, whether it\u2019s doing push-ups, walking the dog or reflecting on nature.\n\n1. Seek renewal\n\nEvery time I begin a collection, I say to myself, \u201cYou have to make something new, different from last time.\u201d I think that way every time, which can be heavy. I respect the designers that have the mental power to be consistent, but this is my tendency. Designing is, to put it very simply, an obligation. The day before my SS25 women\u2019s show, I asked myself how many collections I could continue to do. One? Two? But at night, once it was over and I came back to my hotel bed, I started to think, \u201cOh, I can keep going.\u201d New challenges give me power, an active spirit.\n\n2. Need an idea? Go driving\n\nCreativity comes in many situations. Sometimes I wonder if someone is pushing me, giving me this inspiration. Who? I don\u2019t know. These days, I feel it most when I\u2019m driving a car, which is very strange. When the signal becomes red, you have to stop, people walk by. And I find \u2013 \u201cWow!\u201d \u2013 inspiration comes.\n\nI thought I\u2019d be a musician or painter, never a fashion designer\n\n3. Keep moving\n\nRecently I started doing press-ups every day. On the first day, I could do only 20, but recently, I did more than 50. I\u2019ve always done a lot of sports \u2013 judo and karate. So, in the street, if I get too angry, I can kick people! When I was 45, I returned to martial arts for the first time since I was a young boy. I studied karate for 13 years and took a black belt. Before we begin, we sit in Japanese style and meditate for about five minutes, because simply practising karate is dangerous. If the hand hits the weakest part of the human body, [one] can kill.\n\n4. Meditate on small gestures\n\nToday, my meditation happens when my son visits me in Tokyo and we walk the dog together. It\u2019s my happiest moment. I wake up naturally at five in the morning and wait for my son who wakes up at six. Then we walk for one hour. There\u2019s the push and pull of the lead in my hand. As my dog leads, I follow. In that moment, I meditate.\n\nYamamoto photographed in Paris just before his 81st birthday \u00a9 Valentin Hannequin\n\n5. Detours can define you\n\nI thought I\u2019d like to be a musician or a painter, never a fashion designer. My mother had opened a very tiny dressmaking salon and started working to provide for me, to ensure I ate. We were very poor. I began helping my mother after graduating from fashion school and after four or five years, my mother finally told me, \u201cYohji, you can take over, and you can take my place.\u201d\n\n6. Don\u2019t disturb the eye\n\nWhen I started feeling that I wanted to make ready-to-wear, I wanted to have women wear men\u2019s outfits. I stopped using flowery colours, which disturbed people\u2019s eyes, and started using black, navy blue and dark brown. For myself, I used to wear black too, so as not to disturb people and finally, black became fashion \u2013 I hated it! But I use black because it doesn\u2019t bother people\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s it. I\u2019ve no other reason.\n\n7. Picasso was right\n\nHe was very envious of the way children draw: it is not very well done, not perfect. Sometimes an animal looks like a human being, a human being looks like a cat. For SS25, I was inspired by the way that Picasso spent 40 years learning to draw like a kid \u2013 his greatest lesson. I felt the same. If kids made fashion, what would happen?\n\n8. There\u2019s power in nature\n\nIn Japan we have the Shinto religion, the oldest in our country, which connects us to nature. I have travelled all around the world, mostly walking around, looking at landscapes, rocky sceneries and plants and flowers. Nature is incredibly strong. I have said to myself that I will never be able to design such beauty. It is impossible, more than beautiful.\n\n9. Buddhism helps...\n\nI used to listen to Buddhists who talk about how you can be quiet by learning Buddhism. I used to listen to it carefully. But finally, I couldn\u2019t become quiet! I have been telling myself for many years, \u201cI have to study Buddhism \u2018properly\u2019.\u201d But what does \u201cproperly\u201d mean? Recently, I began studying it again, deeply. Perhaps it was the loss of my closest friend, the Japanese writer Seig\u014d Matsuoka [in August 2024], who taught me so much about Buddhism. The world today is very dangerous. I am in pain with what is happening. Buddhism teaches us how to avoid wars as much as possible. A lot of people are coming to Japan now, not only because the yen rate is cheap! They are finding something else there. Maybe it\u2019s spirituality?\n\n10. ...but I don\u2019t have the answers, yet\n\nIt\u2019s people\u2019s duty to live by learning something. If people think they have learned enough then they\u2019re dead. So, I\u2019m still learning: \u201cWhat is life?\u201d",

It seemed like every week brought a new plot twist \u2014 whether it was a relationship reveal, dating rumors, a wild night out, or a messy situationship. From Papoose and Claressa Shields to The Game and Shaniece Hairston, keep on scrolling to see!\n\nClaressa Shields & Papoose\n\nRemy Ma, Claressa Shields, and Papoose broke the internet with their love triangle drama on Dec. 12. Remy stirred the pot by releasing text message screenshots and accusing Papoose of cheating. He returned the allegations, and Claressa also claimed Ma has two boyfriends but remains worried about Pap!\n\nAdditionally, things heated up when an old video resurfaced of Shields and Papoose backstage before her boxing match. Social media went wild for DAYS over the entire fiasco, which has since quieted down.\n\nThe Game & Shaniece Hairston\n\nThis year, The Game and Shaniece Hairston made their bedroom business public! Folks speculated for months that they were expecting a baby, but neither of them confirmed it. However, things took a turn when Shaniece posted a pic with The Game on her Instagram Stories shortly after he shared a snap of his newborn son, Blaze Taylor.\n\nFurthermore, the rumors finally stopped when Evelyn Lozada hopped in and reshared Game\u2019s post about Blaze on her IG, confirming in her caption that she\u2019s Blaze\u2019s grandma.\n\n\u201cThis little blue-eyed angel made me a grandma, and I\u2019m forever grateful! You\u2019ve brought so much joy into my life that words can\u2019t even explain. I love you more than anything, Blaze Taylor! #GrandmaLove #ForeverGrateful #BlazeTaylor\u201d Evelyn wrote.\n\n#1 Bow Wow & MariahLynn Bow Wow and MariahLynn had the internet going OFF after The Shade Room posted footage of them looking cozy together in November. The clip showed Bow a.k.a Shad Moss, chillin\u2019 on a balcony at an event with Mariah. They started choppin\u2019 it up, and then Bow leaned in to whisper something in her ear. But what really had social media chattin\u2019 was when Bow copped a feel of Mariah\u2019s waist. To this day, neither Bow Wow nor MariahLynn have said a word about what was going on in the video.\n\n#2 Chloe Bailey & Burna Boy Rumors started flying fast after Burna Boy and Chloe Bailey linked up earlier this month in Lagos, Nigeria. Videos of them started popping up online, showing them pulling up to a nightclub together and partying inside. Neither of them has confirmed if they are dating, but fans went wild on Chloe\u2019s IG with questions about whether they\u2019re more than friends.\n\n#3 Additional footage came out of Chloe and Burna dancing really close in a club, which, of course, didn\u2019t help the rumors. At one point, the R&B singer even had her arms around him as she danced in a printed mini dress and Burna stood on a couch shirtless!\n\n#4 Megan Thee Stallion & Torrey Craig Let\u2019s not forget Megan Thee Stallion and Torrey Craig. Fans have been speculating for weeks that they\u2019re dating and claim that a few public link-ups are proof. The speculation kicked off back in September thanks to their viral TikTok couple\u2019s challenge video. The two got people talking when they played the game in bed together. In September, they took things up a notch with cozy pictures of themselves in New York.",

            "content": "A Denver couple was the victim of a hit-and-run accident this week. Their RV was severely damaged. Photo by Housekeys Action Network Denver\n\nA couple who had lived in their RV on the streets of Denver for many years became the victims of a hit and run last month.\n\nAccording to a statement e-mailed to the author of this article from Housekeys Action Network Denver, or HAND, \u201cUnlike normal hit and runs where police investigate the incident and get insurance info from the perpetrator to pay for damage, in this case police have refused to investigate and get insurance to pay for repairs -- specifically because this couple is houseless living in the RV. Anti-houseless statements by these police have made this prejudice clear - and left this couple with a severely damaged trailer and RV.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, police said they are investigating the incident. \"The Denver Police Department responded to a hit and run crash that occurred in the area of 45th and Ivy involving a RV and what was reported by witnesses as a UPS semi truck on December 14, 2024. Preliminary information indicates that the UPS semi was making a right hand turn onto 45th Ave. and struck the parked RV. The motorist kept driving and did not stop to provide any information. Responding officers made a report and it is still under investigation to determine who was driving. The investigator was able to reach out to UPS and get insurance information for the victim. The victim was provided that information on Jan. 2. If anyone has any information that can identify the run driver or provide more information to solve this case, they are encouraged to contact Denver Metro Crime Stoppers at 720-913-STOP(7867).\"\n\nVideo shows damage to RV\n\nHAND provided a video that shows the damage to the RV and the occupants' interactions with police. The video was taken in the parking lot of an industrial complex in the parking lot of Whisler Bearings, 5775 E. 45th Ave. In the video, the owner of the RV shows both his license plate and insurance information to police.\n\nPolice: Move along\n\nPolice and the Street Enforcement Team routinely prod motor home dwellers parked on Denver streets to move along. The couple whose RV was struck by a heavy truck are no exception. \u201cTwo days (after the crash), when they drove over to one of the hotel shelters where the woman was scheduled to be picked up for a ride to a medical appointment, they were told by staff they could park there during her appointment but then were bombarded by security telling them to leave,\u201d HAND explained in the statement. \u201cThen they moved onto a public street and while she was gone at the appointment, security called the police who then rolled up on her husband in their RV. They harassed him and threatened to tow their RV, but finally, ultimately left.\n\n\u201cThen two days later, police rolled up on them on a different public street,\u201d HAND explained. \u201cThe police threatened to ticket them for the \u2018poverty tow\u2019 law -- the law that makes it illegal to park any large vehicles or vehicles deemed \u2018junkers\u2019 (for things as petty as a cracked windshield) on any public street for more than two hours total in a week.\u201d HAND said the law \u201cgives police the full authority to decide when a vehicle is a \u2018junker,\u2019 issue warnings, and steal people\u2019s homes and all their belongings just at the police\u2019s word and whim.\u201d\n\nIn the case of this couple the police posted the RV with a 48-hour parking warning. \u201cYet another \u2018abandoned\u2019 vehicle warning for a vehicle they are sitting in, driving from block to block every day, and that is their home with all their tools for survival,\u201d HAND reported.\n\nTow likely, shelter offered\n\nWhen HAND issued their statement, they said the couple\u2019s RV was about to be towed, which would leave them homeless. Jon Ewing, a spokesman with Denver\u2019s Department of Human Services, said the couple was expected to be offered a spot in one of Denver\u2019s All in Mile High shelter locations on Tuesday. He declined additional comment saying he did not know the details of the incident.\n\n\n\n",

Looking forward, the market to reach US$ 11.0 Billion by 2032, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 6.02% during 2023-2032\n\nThe escalating demand for continuous power supply on the global level, rapid digitalization and the rising dependence on technology for conducting business operations, and considerable rise in cloud computing represent some of the key factors driving the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA data center UPS or uninterruptible power supply refers to a crucial element in data center infrastructure that is specifically designed to provide an alternate power supply to data center equipment in case of a power outage or disruption. These systems ensure seamless operation and protect the data center from suffering any loss or damage. Capacity is one of the key characteristics of data center UPS systems that is determined by kilovolt-amperes (kVA) or megavolt-amperes (MVA) rating, along with its runtime, which defines the duration of backup power provision. The primary function of data center UPS is to provide power backup to critical data center equipment, thereby eliminating data loss, equipment damage, and operational downtime.\n\n\n\nThese UPS systems are also responsible for regulating voltage and frequency to ensure the power supplied to equipment is steady and dependable. In addition to this, remote monitoring and management capabilities are also available in many product variants, which provide data center operators with a centralized means of monitoring and managing the UPS performance.\n\nThe report has also provided a comprehensive analysis of the competitive landscape in the market. Competitive analysis such as market structure, market share by key players, player positioning, top winning strategies, competitive dashboard, and company evaluation quadrant has been covered in the report. Also, detailed profiles of all major companies have been provided.\n\n\n\nSome of the companies covered include ABB Ltd., Cyber Power Systems Inc., Delta Electronics Inc., Eaton Corporation plc, General Electric Company, Kohler Uninterruptible Power (Ireland) Limited, Legrand, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, RPS Spa (Riello Elettronica S.p.A.), Schneider Electric SE, Solaredge Technologies Inc., Toshiba Corporation and Vertiv Group Corporation, etc. Kindly note that this only represents a partial list of companies, and the complete list has been provided in the report.\n\n\n\nData Center UPS Market Trends:\n\n\n\nThe market is primarily driven by the escalating demand for continuous power supply on the global level. This can be attributed to the rapid digitalization and the rising dependence on technology for conducting business operations, resulting in a higher demand for 24/7 availability of the data centers. In line with this, a considerable rise in cloud computing is leading to the growing number of data centers, which, in turn, has augmented the demand for UPS systems. Moreover, the rising need for eco-friendly solutions for reducing power consumption and achieving energy efficiency is propelling the demand for UPS systems that use renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.\n\n\n\nThe market is further fueled by the growing awareness regarding downtime costs and protection against power outages.

But Sheila and Jake Stothard, 81 and 84 respectively, have recently found Instagram fame for their incredible fitness.\n\nThe Stothards, from Sunderland, became internet stars after their grandson, Phil Mackenzie, began sharing videos of the couple on his own page, Leansquad. The clips show off how easily the two can keep up with Phil, 37, who played professional rugby for London Welsh and the Sale Sharks until 2014; his \u201cnanny\u201d Sheila can be seen sprinting and leaping up stairs, while grandad Jake holds planks, lifts weights and finishes hundreds of push-ups in a row.\n\nJake and Sheila pictured with their grandson Phil, a fitness influencer - Chloe Ellingson for The Telegraph\n\nThe family has racked up more than 20 million views online. People are often \u201cshocked\u201d to learn that they are octogenarians, Phil says. \u201cMy grandparents like showing off their feats of strength, which are pretty impressive,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut mostly it\u2019s for other people, to show them what life can be like in your 80s and even later when you prioritise your health.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheila and Jake have always been active, but their recent efforts to get into even better shape prove that it\u2019s never too late to get lean and build strength and mobility. \u201cMy grandad had already been in the weights room for a long time, but we\u2019ve tried to focus on the programming and what he does in a week,\u201d says Phil. \u201cAt 84 he has become so much stronger in a really short period of time.\u201d\n\nHere is how the Stothards have stayed fighting fit into their 80s, from what they eat to how they exercise and when they sleep.\n\nSheila and Jake prove that it\u2019s never too late to get lean and build strength and mobility\n\nSheila, 81\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been active, but not deliberately,\u201d Sheila says. \u201cI walk everywhere, including the four-mile trip to the shops and back every day. I do have a car, and I use it if it\u2019s a long way, but for a walk like that I\u2019ll want to get myself there.\u201d\n\nThough Sheila and her husband now live in Toronto, having moved to Canada in 1983 when Sheila was 40, her attitude to staying fit has changed little. As a teenager, in her early 20s, and then into her 30s, \u201cI used to walk everywhere like I do now, but back in those days that\u2019s just what we would do.\u201d\n\nSheila and Jake aged 19\n\nIt has helped that she has always had an active job, too. When she and Jake came to Toronto for Jake\u2019s work in roofing, she got a job in childcare, \u201cso I was always running around after kids and picking them up\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir morning starts at quarter to six, \u201cif I can lie in that long,\u201d Sheila says. \u201cWe like to go to bed early, about nine o\u2019clock, maybe half past nine. I\u2019ll get up and make porridge for breakfast, and tidy up and do the laundry. Then usually I\u2019ll go on an hour\u2019s walk.\u201d\n\nBoth she and Jake credit her cooking for their health into their 80s. \u201cWe\u2019re conscious of what we eat, but we eat plenty of it, especially for people our age,\u201d she says.\n\nHer home-cooked meals are made up of vegetables and lean protein. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll make a big curry, with vegetables like carrots and parsnips with chicken for dinner, and for other meals we\u2019ll have a baked sweet potato and cottage cheese, or shredded cabbage.\u201d\n\nSheila says she and Jake are the \u2018only older couple that I see using the gym\u2019 - Chloe Ellingson for The Telegraph\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLunch might be \u201csome peanuts in a dish with three dates, an apple and a tangerine, instead of a sandwich or something like that\u201d. They veer away from red meat: \u201cI might cook a burger once a week or so,\u201d Sheila says.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m paranoid about food,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf I\u2019m round someone\u2019s house and they give me tea and a biscuit, I won\u2019t say no. There\u2019s nothing that we absolutely never have.\u201d\n\nThe couple also tend to avoid alcohol. \u201cIf a friend asks us to come up for a meal and a glass of wine, we won\u2019t say no,\u201d Sheila says, \u201cbut you\u2019ll never find us with a bottle of wine between us of an evening.\u201d\n\nAfter a big breakfast and lunch \u201cwe\u2019ll go for a walk for two hours every afternoon, come rain or shine, even if we\u2019re in hail or snow,\u201d Shelia says. \u201cIt just feels so much better than to sit in the house with the TV on.\u201d\n\nThe couple eat healthy, home-cooked meals and avoid alcohol, but do not obtsain from anything absolutely - Chloe Ellingson for The Telegraph\n\nSheila also likes to use a rowing machine when she has access to one, \u201cand I\u2019ll go on the elliptical at the gym in the apartment block where we live at least once a week,\u201d she says. Plenty of the couple\u2019s friends and neighbours are walkers, \u201cbut we\u2019re the only older couple that I see using the gym\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat keeps Sheila motivated is being able to keep up with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and live an independent life. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to have help from our kids and grandkids,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to help them instead. That\u2019s why I walk as much as I do. And I feel good \u2013 to me that\u2019s so important.\u201d\n\nJake, 84\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty active my whole life,\u201d Jake says. Strength training might be trendy now, but he and his friends were lifting weights well before the practice went mainstream.\n\n\u201cI started strength training in my late teenage years, probably 16 or 17, while I was working the coal mines,\u201d he says. With his friend Freddy Barnes, a former Mr Sunderland, Jake would \u201cgo down to the shipyard and nick whatever scrap metal would resemble weights\u201d.\n\nJake (right) doing a bicep curl, alongside his friend Freddy (centre) who is a former Mr Sunderland\n\n\u201cOur training was pretty basic back then, but that\u2019s all we needed,\u201d Jake says. \u201cWe mostly trained bench press, shoulder press, squats and curls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysically demanding work has also kept him fit over the years. \u201cWhether it was working in the coal mines or construction as a roofer, I was extremely active,\u201d Jake says. As a roofer \u201cI used to get paid depending on how quickly we did the job, which pushed me to be fit and strong\u201d.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been without its dangers. At the age of 55, Jake fell from a roof during work. \u201cI broke my knees, and shattered my wrists and arms. I was told that my wrists were like cornflakes.\u201d\n\nJake with his grandson Phil\n\nTo recover, he took slow steps towards becoming active again. \u201cThe one thing I have always done whenever I have faced adversity is try not to make any excuses,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter the accident I just focused on starting small and over time the small wins led to big wins.\u201d\n\nEven today \u201cI have a torn bicep and severe arthritis in my hands, but I have a good ability to block out my limitations and do what I can to work around them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike his wife , Jake has \u201calways focused on eating whole foods and home-cooked meals\u201d. Even while putting on muscle, \u201cthe one thing that has definitely remained very constant is just eating normal portions,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been one to eat super-large portion sizes, mainly because Sheila always monitored how much she feeds me.\u201d\n\nJake does lower body exercises twice a week and upper body once a week - Chloe Ellingson for The Telegraph\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn top of regular walking with Sheila, Jake now has a more structured weight training routine, designed by his grandson Phil. \u201cI do lower body exercises twice a week, and upper body once a week, with exercises like leg extensions and hamstring curls for my legs, and bench presses and pull-downs for my arms. I do calf raises and step-ups too, which improve my balance and help prevent falls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recently hurt my shoulder, but before that I was training my upper body two or three times a week. I love strength training because it\u2019s so rewarding and makes me feel more capable in so many real life situations, like chasing after our great-grandkids or even helping to renovate Phil\u2019s house when he lived in England.\u201d\n\nJake can hold a plank for five minutes - Chloe Ellingson for The Telegraph\n\nAs part of this regimen, \u201cone of my favourite things to do is my push-ups,\u201d Jake says. \u201cI usually do 500 push-ups, broken up into multiple sets. I rep out as many as I can, take a break and then repeat until I get to 500. I would do this a few times a week.\n\n\u201cAnother bodyweight exercise is the plank. I can hold it for five minutes now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExercise has brought Jake and Sheila together. \u201cWe know that there\u2019ll come a time where we can\u2019t live independently, but we have always bonded over our mutual admiration for being able to accomplish anything,\u201d Jake says.\n\nBut he isn\u2019t used to their newfound fame quite yet. \u201cWe got stopped the other day at Costco, someone asked if we were Leansquad\u2019s grandparents. It\u2019s strange,\u201d he says, \u201cbut amazing to know that we are a part of my grandson\u2019s journey in helping inspire others to stay fit and healthy.\u201d\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Even after ceasing operations in some cities, it had a negative EBITDA of -\u20ac4.69 million in 2023, on sales of \u20ac2.57 million.\n\nBefore these difficulties, however, the startup reached unexpected highs when France went into lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was still riding that wave in late 2021 when Geopost/DPDgroup, the express parcel delivery branch of Groupe La Poste, which handles France\u2019s national postal service, took a majority shareholding in the company.\n\nThe corporate alliance made sense at the time: Geopost was also an investor in last-mile delivery service Stuart, of which Epicery was a heavy user. But in recent months, La Poste cut ties with several startups it previously invested in, and in particular, sold Stuart at a significant loss.\n\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch, Geopost stated that the decision was made \u201cfollowing an in-depth analysis of [Epicery\u2019s] financial and operating performance\u201d leading to the conclusion that \u201cthe subsidiary\u2019s short- and medium-term profitability has been severely impacted by developments in the food delivery market, a gradual post-COVID return to direct consumption from local shops, and strong competition in the catering segment.\u201d\n\nFood delivery in France in 2024 looked vastly different compared to Epicery\u2019s first years (it launched in 2016). At the time, its competitors included Take Eat Easy, which ceased operations in 2016, but Deliveroo and Uber Eats were nowhere in sight, and quick commerce hadn\u2019t gone through its rise and fall. While Cajoo, Flink, Gopuff, and Gorillas no longer operate in France, their marketing presence was hard to escape for quite a while.\n\nIn comparison, Epicery\u2019s scale and visibility were always modest. It had some 25,000 recurring customers, buying from some 1,100 local shops, mostly in Paris and Lyon after it scaled back on its national expansion. This could have made sense as a standalone, lifestyle business, but arguably less so as a VC-backed one, and even less so as part of a large group where numbers like these hardly move the needle, especially with the Stuart synergies gone.\n\nEpicery co-founder and CEO \u00c9douard Morhange wasn\u2019t able to comment on strategic aspects due to a non-disclosure agreement. In a personal statement, however, he commented on Epicery\u2019s legacy. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to have introduced local retailers to ecommerce over the past 10 years, and I\u2019m confident that they\u2019ll continue to develop their digital sales over the coming years.\u201d\n\nMorhange will remain active in the food sector, saying he\u2019s currently working on \u201can ambitious new model that will enable the food industry to pursue its digitalization in France and abroad.\u201d As for Epicery\u2019s employees, Geopost said that each of them will receive \u201csupport from the HR teams to discuss opportunities within the Group or to help them find a job.\u201d\n\nFrench entrepreneur Nicolas Machard, whose food marketplace Pourdebon is also a subsidiary of Geopost, said he\u2019s confident that Epicery\u2019s employees will soon land new roles. He\u2019s also confident that Geopost and Pourdebon are still a great fit, mission-wise and economically. Not only is Pourdebon a heavy user of Geopost\u2019s food delivery service Chronofresh, but it is also on track to reach profitability in 2027, and will likely work on reaching that milestone earlier.\n\nEpicery didn\u2019t manage to make the math work on the profitability front, but it sometimes brought up to 10% or even 20% in sales to local shops it worked with. According to Elsa Hermal, who co-founded Epicery with Morhange and VC Marc Menas\u00e9 before leaving operations in 2019, this was a very important milestone.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wonderful, and what\u2019s very important to me, is that what we promised [shop owners] at the very beginning, and what took us a long time to achieve, has now become an important part of their business,\u201d said Hermal, who\u2019s now a business coach and impact investor through climate fund Satgana.\n\nAs an investor, Hermal knows that Epicery was operating in a complex niche, but doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a no-go. \u201cLogistics businesses are complicated and challenging in terms of metrics, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done.\u201d Now that local businesses have had a taste of this, and in a context where every sale counts, it wouldn\u2019t be too surprising to see an Epicery-like model make a comeback at some point.",

Legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had broken into the building overnight and barricaded the doors with furniture to prevent the opposition from entering.\n\nMeanwhile, protesters supporting the DPP tried to storm the building.

            "content": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies United Parcel Service, Inc. ( ) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does United Parcel Service Carry?\n\nAs you can see below, United Parcel Service had US$21.5b of debt, at September 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$6.06b in cash leading to net debt of about US$15.4b.\n\nA Look At United Parcel Service's Liabilities\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that United Parcel Service had liabilities of US$15.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$36.3b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$6.06b in cash and US$9.43b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$35.9b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nWhile this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since United Parcel Service has a huge market capitalization of US$107.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nUnited Parcel Service has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.3. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 72.9 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On the other hand, United Parcel Service's EBIT dived 17%, over the last year. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine United Parcel Service's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, United Parcel Service produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 62% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\n\nOur View\n\nWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for United Parcel Service was the fact that it seems able to cover its interest expense with its EBIT confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. In particular, EBIT growth rate gives us cold feet. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about United Parcel Service's use of debt. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that , and 1 of those is significant...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

            "content": "The quaint little Santa Cruz we\u2019ve known for decades has been booming in 2024, like no other time since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.\n\nIt\u2019s been a boom year for construction all over the county. It\u2019s also been a boom for environmental troubles, a time when officials have to decide how they will face climate changes that have affected not just the coast, but everywhere throughout the county.\n\nUCSC is growing, while public schools face budget troubles because families and teachers can barely afford to live here.\n\nThere have been positive steps, including bond measures to help build affordable housing for teachers and students. Legislators in 2024 showed they are walking the walk after decades of talk.\n\nOne only has to look at the skyline\u2014a skyline!\u2014in downtown Santa Cruz to see what\u2019s made the year\u2019s biggest change. Is it a plus or a minus? Depends on who you ask.\n\nOn the fun hand, the good times have blossomed in this county with more entertainment and great food than you could find in a county of fewer than 300,000 people anywhere in the country. Every night of the week there\u2019s something special going on, from poetry to pop, from Shakespeare to punk.\n\nJANUARY\n\n\u2019SHROOM ZOOM\n\nFinally, after hundreds of years, California got a state mushroom; surprisingly, it\u2019s not psychedelic.\n\nThis year, Cantharellus californicus became the official state \u2019shroom.\n\nSo what does it do? You eat it and it tastes great, fans say, and the portions are huuuuge.\n\nThe yellow-orange native fungus, clocking in at a max of 20 inches wide, is the largest edible chanterelle in the world, although nothing compared to the Termitomyces titanicus, of West Africa and Zambia, whose cap reaches 3.28 feet in diameter.\n\nJust imagine the pizza you could make.\n\nDEBATE FORESTALLS ACTION\n\nThe Santa Cruz City Council unveiled a new version of the Wharf Master Plan, designed to enhance and maintain the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf. The new plan ditched the proposed Western Walkway, a pedestrian path eight feet below the restaurants with new, shorter pilings to protect the current pilings from big waves. The change came after a group called Don\u2019t Morph the Wharf, headed by Gillian Greensite, won a CEQA ruling in 2022 that found the city\u2019s plan didn\u2019t take environmental repercussions into account.\n\nOn Jan. 9 the council voted unanimously for the new plan, in part because Don\u2019t Morph the Wharf agreed to drop ongoing litigation\u2014which allowed the city to get $6 million in funding from the Coastal Conservancy for wharf repairs. Councilmember Renee Golder, who favored the walkway, explained her vote: \u201cIt is time we move on. We just need to protect the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nMore proof of how badly that work was needed came at the end of the year when 150 feet of the wharf fell into the sea during especially high waves. Expect the battles to continue.\n\nLAWFARE\n\nCalifornia lawmakers were busy making your life more complicated for the new year. Sacramento legislators sent off 1,046 bills, of which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed 890 into law.\n\nThey included: raising the minimum wage up to $20 an hour from $15.50 and up to $25 an hour for health care workers, or still not enough to afford a home in Santa Cruz.\n\nAnother law raises the number of employee sick days from three to five and prohibits employers from penalizing sick workers.\n\nIn response to harsh abortion laws passed in other states, California shields doctors from being prosecuted for providing abortions to women who come from other states and protects physicians who mail abortion pills to out-of-state patients.\n\nLandlords have been restricted from asking for more than one month\u2019s rent for a security deposit and PG&E rates were defined by income. Low-income customers were to be billed $300 a year less and those earning more than $180,000 a year would pay $500 more.\n\nIn the fun dept., lawmakers made it unlawful for cities to make cruising illegal and forbid employers from testing or asking about past marijuana use.\n\nSANTA CRUZ GAVE\n\nWho says there\u2019s no good news? There was plenty to end 2023 and start 2024 on a high note: Santa Cruz Gives, the charity sponsored by Good Times, raised $1 million for 65 charities last year and is on track for more good news this year.\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nKIDS STRANDED\n\nPajaro Valley School District students were being left at school and parents have had to take time off work to pick them up because of a shortage of bus drivers. The district needs 75 drivers to take care of the area\u2019s largest school district, but is short 21.\n\nThe district voted to reward $1,000 to anyone who recommends qualified bus drivers. Low pay and high housing costs contribute to the shortage. Hourly wages range from $19.68 to $25.11 and it can take six months to get certified.\n\nTERMINAL TERMINATED\n\nThe downtown Santa Cruz bus terminal, long a fixture on Pacific Avenue, was closed this month for a reset. Bus service has been kicked to the curb, literally, along Front Street, Soquel Avenue and River Street, while the old spot is turned into a behemoth of apartments that will contain 126 units of affordable housing, commercial and office space and a new bus station.\n\nFor better and worse, Santa Cruz now has a skyline more resembling Mountain View than Carmel.\n\nSome people claim quaint Santa Cruz is now ain\u2019t Santa Cruz.\n\nPUBLIC OR NOT?\n\nDespite the California Coastal Commission\u2019s order to allow the path behind Aptos condos along Beach Street in Rio Del Mar to be open and available for all, the owners of what are mostly beachside vacation rentals rebelled against a $4.8 million fine and replaced the small, haphazard wall they first made with a big fence, blocking the public from walking along the beach and forcing them to walk in a busy street.\n\nThis is a long-standing debate that will still have more days in court. The local court ruled in favor of the homeowners, while the Commission favored public access to the path.\n\nFAREWELL TO A LOCAL HERO\n\nHundreds of locals showed up at Cabrillo College Feb. 17 to say goodbye to philanthropist Rowland Rebele, who passed away in November 2023.\n\nReb contributed so much to this community, as writer Geoffrey Dunn recalled \u201chis tireless advocacy for those experiencing homelessness; his generous commitment to the arts, education, journalism and newspaper publishing; his relentless protection of First Amendment rights; his delight in political campaigns (win or lose). Reb was seemingly everywhere at all times\u2026his passions were broad and his energies both enthusiastic and unyielding.\u201d\n\nRecently retired County Supe Zach Friend noted: \u201cWhether it was helping build skate parks for local youth or ensuring that the least fortunate are elevated in local government, Reb always quietly and effectively finds a way to make our community better for future generations.\u201d\n\nMARCH\n\nGETTING HIGH\n\nOn March 4, local developer Workbench submitted a pre-application plan for the Clocktower Center to the City of Santa Cruz. At 18 stories with 260 apartments, the building at the former site of Santa Cruz County Bank and the Rush Inn would be the tallest building in the county. The next day, voters nixed Measure M, which would have required an election for buildings taller than the city\u2019s current limit of five to eight stories.\n\nBut even without the threat of the vote, there was significant pushback on the idea of an 18-story structure. As it currently stands, Workbench has submitted an application for an eight-story project with 174 units on the Clocktower site, and city planners are reviewing the application.\n\nTo get a rough idea of what eight stories looks like, one needs to look no further than the 530 Front St. housing project in downtown Santa Cruz, an eight-story, 276-unit rental housing complex now under construction by Swenson Builder, which was approved by the city in April 2023 and soared skyward in the past year.\n\nAPRIL\n\nSLUGGER TIME\n\nThe most illustrious member of the Ariolimacidae family, the banana slug, was upgraded from UCSC\u2019s mascot (voted in by students in 1986) to California\u2019s own state slug in April when the Legislature gave thumbs up to Assembly Bill 1850, authored by Santa Cruz\u2019s Gail Pellerin.\n\nSigned into law by Gavin Newsom in September, the bright yellow gastropod takes its place among other state symbols, including the pallid bat, the California dogface butterfly and the Pacific leatherback sea turtle.\n\nSTORM WATCH\n\nThe West Cliff 50-Year Community Vision was adopted by the Santa Cruz City Council on April 9. A response to the damage sustained by West Cliff Drive from the 2023 winter storms, the 50-year plan addresses the biggest issues facing the roadway.\n\nBut one part of the vision\u2014a pilot program for one-way traffic\u2014was voted down after dozens spoke out during public comment, including residents, former officials and members of the Santa Cruz Boardriders Club.\n\nSince then the city has continued working on a 5-Year Roadmap for this beloved stretch of road, with a final report heading to the Santa Cruz City Council in March 2025. A public comment period will run through mid-January.\n\nMAY\n\nGROWING LIKE WEEDS\n\nThe corner of Mission and Laurel began a process of transformation this spring, first on May 13, when the contentious debate over approval of a dispensary operating near Santa Cruz High School ended when the Santa Cruz City Council voted 6-1 to greenlight the Hook Outlet at the former site of Emily\u2019s Bakery.\n\nBut the bigger change came on May 28 when the Santa Cruz City Council unanimously approved a 48-unit housing project at the current site of the Food Bin and Herb Room, a project with no available parking, where residents aren\u2019t allowed to own cars. WTF?\n\nUPS AND DOWNS\n\nOne century ago, on May 17, 1924, the wheels began to turn on the Giant Dipper, and the momentum kept the historic wooden roller coaster moving into the 21st century.\n\nIn his Good Times, author Geoffrey Dunn remembers the day that he, like countless locals before and after him, finally surpassed the 50-inch mark and was tall enough to take that first thrilling ride.\n\nHe also reveals other milestones in the history of roller coasters in Santa Cruz, which began in 1885.\n\nCURTAIN FALLS\u2026AND RISES\n\nOn May 26, Jewel Theatre Company took its final bow with a production of Ted Swindley\u2019s Always \u2026 Patsy Cline. Company founder Julie James plays the title role, which Good Times critic Christina Waters fits her talents perfectly, \u201cfrom her bouffant hairdo down to her kitten heels.\u201d\n\nThough it survived a 20-month shutdown during the pandemic, the Jewel\u2014like many other theater companies\u2014suffered a form of \u201clong Covid\u201d in the 2022/23 season, when only 70% of its subscribers returned.\u201cMany people just simply got out of the habit of attending performing arts events,\u201d James said when she announced the closure at the end of that season.\n\nThe good news? All About Theatre, a great local company, has moved in.\n\nUNCLE CHARLIE\u2019S SPRING CAMP\n\nExtracurricular activities on the UC Santa Cruz campus made headlines this year, especially as the spring semester drew to a close.\n\nUCSC Students for Justice in Palestine began an encampment at Quarry Plaza, echoing protest demands on other campuses that colleges nationwide divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nOn May 20, UCSC graduate students and researchers went on strike to protest the treatment of fellow union members during pro-Palestinian protests at UCLA and UC San Diego. In the early morning of May 31, law enforcement agencies from across the state were called in to dismantle a blockade at the base of the campus.\n\nUniversity officials said more than 100 protesters were arrested, and the University also issued a two-week campus ban for students who were detained. Charges are still pending.\n\nJUNE\n\nNEW TOWN?\n\nThe north end isn\u2019t the only part of downtown Santa Cruz that\u2019s seen taller buildings sprouting. Also in the works is the South of Laurel Area Plan, which envisions a bustling neighborhood and a new 3,200-seat arena for the Santa Cruz Warriors in the south end.\n\nA riverwalk, open-air dining on Pacific Avenue down to the beach and a pedestrianized Spruce Street in front of the future Warriors\u2019 arena are among the enticements, along with 1,600 new living spaces. Comments were collected through mid-July, and we are awaiting a final report.\n\nHEADING SOUTH\n\nSanta Cruz County took a big step toward equity for residents in the south when the new South County Government Center opened on June 11. A makeover of the former West Marine building on Westridge Drive, the 121,000-square-foot building holds the Human Services Department, Agricultural Commissioner\u2019s Office, County Clerk/Elections and Treasurer-Tax Collector\u2019s Office.\n\nTWO DECADES OF FRIDAYS\n\nThis year, Santa Cruz\u2019s First Friday celebration turned 20\u2014and it\u2019s still going strong.\n\nWriter Richard Stockton interviewed its founders, Kirby Scudder and Chip, and also talked to current director Bree Karpavage, who says that although the monthly open gallery event was intended to help emerging artists.\n\n\u201cOver 20 years it has become a place for any artist of any level to show their work. A lot of well-known artists are Santa Cruz based; they live and work here but they haven\u2019t necessarily shown here, and now because of First Friday, they\u2019re starting to show in Santa Cruz.\u201d\n\nJULY\n\nBIG MUSIC BOOST\n\nThe Santa Cruz Symphony announced a $1 million legacy gift from longtime board member Mark Chambers-Bray in memory of the late Roy Chambers-Bray, the largest single donation in the 67-year-history of the Symphony.\n\nA longtime supporter of the arts, Mark Chambers-Bray recalls that he and Roy had agreed, upon their retirement, that they \u201creally wanted to funnel our energies and our passion toward the things that inspired us. And the Santa Cruz Symphony was one of those things.\n\nTINY HOUSES, BIG QUESTIONS\n\nFor years, unhoused people have camped in the levee area at the border of Watsonville and Pajaro, which is vulnerable during floods.\n\nThe \u201cRecurso de Fuerza\u201d (Resource of Strength) tiny home micro village was proposed in 2023 as a joint effort between Santa Cruz and Monterey counties to address homelessness. But residents in the East Front Street neighborhood of Watsonville pushed back against the project, saying local officials had ignored their concerns over crime and safety.\n\n\u201cWhy is our voice not being heard?\u201d asked Catalina Torres, who is a spokesperson for the group. Councilmember Eduardo Montesino said the decision on the project will lie with the county and state, but he urged residents to keep an open mind.\n\nCAMPS OUT\n\nDays after Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order directing jurisdictions throughout the state to address the homeless encampments within their borders\u2014and about one month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that laws banning sleeping in public do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment\u2014unsanctioned camps throughout the state have been cleared, and the residents moved to shelters, or to other illicit sites.\n\nOn July 29, Santa Cruz Police were in Pogonip Open Space, clearing out several encampments where homeless advocates say 50 people had been living.\n\nSanta Cruz Homelessness Response Manager Larry Imwalle said the action was not sparked by Newsom\u2019s announcement or the Supreme Court decision. Rather, officials were looking to clear fire-prone areas and ameliorate environmental impacts caused by campsites.\n\nPolice \u201cmade multiple visits over several weeks trying to engage folks, connect them with services if they\u2019re interested and shelter options in particular,\u201d according to Imwalle, who added, \u201cIt\u2019s the humane and respectful way to go through this process.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in Watsonville, officials cleared encampments along the Pajaro River, where people living along the levee have dug shelters into the soil, which weakens the levee and increases flooding risks, Watsonville Police spokeswoman Michelle Pulido said.\n\nAthena Flannery of Homeless United for Friendship and Freedom took exception with the sweeps, arguing that 10-day notices didn\u2019t give campers enough time, especially for homeless people with few resources, many of whom are disabled. She added that the Homeless Persons Health Project would present a letter to the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, asking for a shift in thinking in the way local officials deal with the homeless population.\n\nAUGUST\n\nREASONABLE DOUBTS\n\nThe courtroom was packed as Santa Cruz County Superior Court Judge Denine Guy read her ruling that the prosecution had shown there was reasonable doubt that convicted murderer Adrian Gonzalez should be released from the juvenile detention system in October\u2014on his 25th birthday\u2014after his conviction for the 2015 kidnapping, rape and murder of his 8-year-old neighbor, Madyson \u201cMaddy\u201d Middleton.\n\nAccording to state law, the juvenile system only keeps individuals until they are 25 years old. After that it is up to the courts to decide if they should be released. The judge said there was \u201cprobable cause to warrant a trial,\u201d leaving Gonzalez\u2019s fate in the hands of 12 jurors, with a verdict not expected until the new year.\n\nHARBOR FUGITIVES\n\nTwo people were shot Aug. 8 after the Crow\u2019s Nest Beach Party in the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor. Santa Cruz Police arrested Moses Dollar, 27, after he was captured in Los Angeles Sep. 18.\n\nOn Sept. 30, a second suspect, Mo Jakaella Porter, walked into the Santa Cruz Police Department, turned herself in and was booked for criminal conspiracy and attempted homicide.\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\nSHERIFF APPARENT\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors unanimously appointed Undersheriff Chris Clark to take the agency\u2019s lead role, a decision that was foreshadowed when Santa Cruz County Sheriff Jim Hart announced in August that he would leave before the end of his term and endorsed Clark to succeed him.\n\nThe supes got on board Sept 3, along with Santa Cruz County District Attorney Jeff Rosell and Chief Public Defender Heather Rogers, to make it official. County Supervisor Zach Friend said that said the tension that exists in many other law enforcement agencies\u2014and the high turnover\u2014does not exist in the Santa Cruz County Sheriff\u2019s Office thanks to the leadership of Clark.\n\nClark took on the new position Dec. 6.\n\nWHARF\u2019S UP\n\nSeveral thousand people showed up for the reopening ceremony of the Capitola Wharf on Sept. 25, celebrating its survival after it was cleaved in two by heavy storms.\n\nThe wharf, built in 1857, boasts new lighting, side rails, benches, permanently mounted viewing scopes, several art installations, a wider deck, restrooms, bait and gift shops and a boat rental facility. Around 150 new pilings were added for strength.\n\nThe renovation repaired damage from the 2023/24 storms and tidal surge.\n\nJessica Kahn, the city\u2019s public works director, said the $10 million project was \u201ca huge investment for a city this size.\u201d\n\nNEW LOSD LEADERSHIP\n\nAfter this year\u2019s budget crisis, threat of layoffs and resignation of a beleaguered superintendent, things are finally looking up in the Live Oak School District. Patrick S\u00e1nchez takes the reins as district superintendent, seeking to turn things around and avoid more cuts amid enrollment declines at the district\u2019s six schools.\n\nThe working 2025-26 budget calls for an additional $1.3 million in salary reductions if the district\u2019s financial picture does not improve by next year. S\u00e1nchez is aiming to increase enrollment by developing \u201csignature programming\u201d at each school site.\n\nDISLODGING PROTEST\n\nAfter USCS\u2019s 2024 spring quarter ended with dramatic clashes between hundreds of protestors and multiple law enforcement agencies at the base of the campus, resulting in over 122 arrests, new university policies are tamping down on direct actions. The policies were required by state lawmakers as part of the Budget Act of 2024, which allocated over $4.8 billion for the UC system.\n\nThe new policies ban any form of encampment on university property; the erection of any structures on university property; the blocking or obstructing of roadways, walkways, buildings, parking structures or other passageways. It also bans the use of masks to conceal identity.\n\nOn Sept. 9, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a suit in Santa Cruz County Superior Court against the University, saying the bans were \u201cunconstitutional and overbroad, depriving students and faculty of their due process rights.\u201d\n\nJimmy Dutra liable in sexual abuse case\n\nA jury found that Watsonville City Councilman Jimmy Dutra committed sexual battery and lewd and lascivious acts on a minor in his Los Angeles apartment 19 years ago.\n\nThe jury awarded Stephen Siefke more than $1 million in damages for emotional and mental suffering and economic losses. The jury did not, however, determine that Dutra acted with malice, and so could not award punitive damages.\n\nOnly one juror dissented.\n\nThe verdict came after roughly three days of deliberation, which followed a weeklong civil trial.\n\nOCTOBER\n\nSOUTHERN EXPOSURE\n\nPajaro Valley Health Care District\u2014the board responsible for overseeing Watsonville Community Hospital\u2014announced the purchase of the building and surrounding property. The move would bring full local ownership to the institution after years of corporate mismanagement.\n\nIn more good news for South County, a gaggle of local, state and federal officials gathered in Watsonville to celebrate the groundbreaking for the $600 million Pajaro River Flood Risk Management Project, which will build up the levee system and give the region the flood protection it\u2019s needed for decades.\n\nAnd the party didn\u2019t stop there.
