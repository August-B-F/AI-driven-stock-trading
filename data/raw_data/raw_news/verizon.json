            "content": "NEW YORK - Verizon today announced the next evolution of its multi-year consumer business transformation, with a strong value commitment designed to strengthen long-term customer relationships across its mobile and home portfolio. This strategic advancement builds on the company's successful execution of myPlan and myHome, positioning Verizon to further extend its industry leadership.\n\n\u201cToday marks the next strategic step of the consumer business transformation journey that began two years ago,\" said Verizon Chairman and CEO, Hans Vestberg. \u201cWe are redefining our relationship with consumers by building on our industry-leading network and innovative offerings. By giving unprecedented value and predictability across both mobile and home, we are establishing the new industry standard for a long-term customer relationship, supporting our path to improved retention, sustainable revenue growth, and long-term shareholder value.\u201d\n\n\"We\u2019re committed to delivering what our customers want and need, offering more control, value and simplicity,\" added Sowmyanarayan Sampath, Verizon Consumer CEO. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to introduce this industry-leading guarantee: a 3-year price lock across mobile and home, which provides peace of mind, and a free phone on every myPlan, giving customers even more value. We have the most ways to save with offers you can\u2019t find anywhere else including free satellite texting and the Verizon Openbank High Yield Savings Account.\u201d\n\nEffective today, Verizon introduces three ways to add even more value for its customers, further strengthening its unique market position:\n\n1. Price Lock Guarantee on all plans:\n\nVerizon is the first and only carrier in the industry offering new and existing customers a three-year price lock guarantee on all myPlan and myHome network plans.\n\nCustomers don\u2019t have to take any action. All existing myPlan customers will automatically be enrolled. And, every time you change your myPlan, the price lock resets for another 3 years.\n\nThis industry-first guarantee ensures your core monthly plan price for calling, data and texting will not change, excluding taxes, fees and perks.\n\n2. Free phone and home router guarantee:\n\nNow, new and existing customers are guaranteed the same great deals on any myPlan with trade-in. Today that means a free phone when they trade-in any phone, any condition from Apple, Google or Samsung.\n\nHome internet routers are included at no additional cost with every myHome plan. No extra fees, just included.\n\n3. The most ways to save, only at Verizon:\n\nVerizon is the first and only in the industry to guarantee free satellite text messaging on qualifying devices on any myPlan. We don't believe that people should have to pay for this. It\u2019s value and peace of mind, on us.\n\nmyPlan and myHome customers can save over 40% on five of the most popular subscription services, Netflix & Max and Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. All 5 for just $20/mo.\n\nPlus, customers save an additional $15/mo when they have myPlan and myHome, and they get a perk on us with our best Internet plans.\n\nAnd now, customers can save big on their Verizon bill with the Verizon Visa Credit Card and the Verizon Open bank High Yield Savings Account.\n\nFor more information, visit verizon.com.",

Verizon didn\u2019t specifically mention this policy, but did say that the move was intended to give \u201cpredictability\u201d to its customer base.\n\nHowever, there are some caveats. Customers have to be enrolled in one of the company\u2019s newer myPlan subscriptions to be eligible. Also, the guarantee only covers the base charge for the rate plan. It doesn\u2019t do anything regarding those mysterious little fees that carriers use to raise prices on the down low.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 BIG NEWS! \ud83d\udd25 Verizon is introducing a 3-Year Price Guarantee for ALL new and existing customers on myPlan & myHome, PLUS a FREE phone with trade-in and free satellite messaging!\n\n\n\nLearn how to save big:https://t.co/tabDgx5jgZ \u2014 Verizon News (@VerizonNews) April 3, 2025\n\nThere\u2019s also nothing in the fine print regarding autopay discounts, so those aren\u2019t locked in. This could force a rate hike if Verizon decides alter the discount. Of course, the company will likely try to persuade consumers to increase the monthly bill of their own accord. This carrot usually takes the shape of a \u201cfree\u201d phone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\n\nTo that end, Verizon announced it will be giving free phones to new and existing customers. This requires a suitable trade-in device and enrollment in a myPlan subscription. The three-year price lock also covers the company\u2019s myHome 5G internet plans. Current myPlan members don\u2019t have to do anything to start this price lock process. The enrollment is automatic.\n\nThis is just the latest promotion to lure customers to its myPlan subscriptions. The company recently started offering cheaper subscriptions for Netflix and Max to members. It did something similar for Google One AI Premium subscriptions. Verizon owns a minority stake in Engadget's parent company, but this didn't impact our coverage.\n\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.",

That means Verizon can still raise your monthly bill in the form of increased fees, which is what wireless carriers tend to do anyway when they want to charge more.

There are plenty of levers for companies like Verizon to pull, even with a price lock.\n\nThe price lock isn\u2019t the only new offer on the table, though. Verizon is also throwing in a free phone to new and existing customers. You\u2019ll just need to trade in an old Apple, Samsung, or Google phone in any condition \u2014 and again, you\u2019ll need to be on a myPlan subscription to take advantage.

New and existing myPlan holders can also receive a free phone when they trade in a phone in any condition from Apple, Google, or Samsung, and myHome consumers can receive a home internet router at no additional cost.\n\nThe two spots, created by Ogilvy New York, show Davidson quipping about his new commitment to Verizon, despite being \u201cnot really big into committing to things.\u201d (See: his extensive dating history.)\n\n\u201cI usually stop binging the show halfway through the first episode.

Again, only those on myPlan plans are getting a 3-year price lock guarantee that was announced today, which means that if you aren\u2019t on one, you should prepare for some fun (a price increase at some point).\n\nLook, Verizon just spent the past year raising prices on almost anything they could. They reduced autopay discounts by 50% on older plans. They raised prices on their best unlimited plans by $4/line per month. They even jacked up prices on myPlan customers with 5+ lines, because why not? That last one happened all of 3 months ago to kickstart 2025. Verizon likes to increase prices on things, if that wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nSo today\u2019s news is about them pinky-promising that they won\u2019t do that for the next 3 years as long as you jump into a myPlan plan. You know how we feel about myPlan and whether or not they are good plans (spoiler: they aren\u2019t, at least compared to previous plans). But if you are worried about you wireless bill increasing along with your groceries, beer, gadget purchases, clothes, and literally everything else, then Verizon has a way for your wireless bill to at least remain steady.\n\nHere\u2019s what they said in a press release today about their \u201cPrice Lock Guarantee on all plans\u201d:\n\nVerizon is the first and only carrier in the industry offering new and existing customers a three-year price lock guarantee on all myPlan and myHome network plans.\n\nCustomers don\u2019t have to take any action. All existing myPlan customers will automatically be enrolled. And, every time you change your myPlan, the price lock resets for another 3 years.\n\nThis industry-first guarantee ensures your core monthly plan price for calling, data and texting will not change, excluding taxes, fees and perks.\n\nYou see, the promise is mostly about them being \u201cfirst.\u201d Bragging rights in a time of price increases is certainly something to focus on. But you should also note the part about the price lock reset should you change plans. That\u2019s a hint at future myPlan increases that would hit if you change plans. In other words, if you lock-in today on Unlimited Plus for $70/mo, you would be good for 3 years. However, Verizon could increase Unlimited Plus to $75/mo in the near future, and that would then be your price if you switched to it later on. They aren\u2019t saying that price increases aren\u2019t coming \u2013 they are telling you to lock-in now to avoid future ones.\n\nShould you switch to a myPlan plan in order to lock-in a price increase? That certainly depends on which plan you are currently on, if it has freebies with it, how many lines you utilize, how much speedy data you truly need, etc. Below is the current pricing for all of the myPlan plans as of today. You\u2019ll have to do the math there, but also consider the cost of bundles that may be included in your current (older) plan that myPlan does not include.\n\nDecision time \u2013 have fun!",

Sign up here.\n\nIn sum \u2013 what you need to know\n\nAI network evolution \u2013 Verizon is leveraging AI in three key areas \u2013 customer support, product personalization, and ecosystem building \u2013 to enhance network services, improve customer interactions, and automate operations for internal teams and external clients.\n\nAI partnerships for growth \u2013 Verizon is forging partnerships around its infrastructure with major players like Meta, Nvidia, Google Cloud, enabling businesses to deploy distributed AI workloads at scale and to optimise AI service delivery on fibre and 5G.\n\nAI backbone networks \u2013 Verizon says its infrastructure \u2013 including networks and data centers \u2013 is critical for AI services. It aims to support the AI ecosystem with programmable networks and compute real estate, and to position itself as a key player in the sector.\n\nThere are three \u201cbuckets\u201d for AI at Verizon, says Verizon \u2013 like for most telcos, by extension. \u201cEach is further along in the company than the next \u2013 as far as maturity goes,\u201d explains Steve Szabo, vice president for technology enablement in the technology solutions division at Verizon Business. Generally, these cover quite-new AI advances in quite-old ML practices, mostly covering internal functions like customer care and network maintenance. These will advance further with generative AI, and somewhere down the line with agentic AI, where service interactions for both external customers and internal engineers are automated and autonomous, to an extent \u2013 and inter-linked, as well.\n\nOtherwise, Verizon Business is using AI to expose more dynamic product service features to its customers, for transparency and management of their airtime and devices, via application programming interfaces (APIs) and as-a-service portals. This work is also developing to include inherent network features in its standalone 5G (5G SA) infrastructure, as well, as it is upgraded and advanced across the US \u2013 so services are scalable and configurable for enterprises \u201cat the click of a button\u201d. And just like with its customer support functions, generative and agentic AI will, over time, make its network services more responsive and powerful.\n\nSzabo \u2013 AI ecosystem partnerships\n\nBut the big AI play for operators right now is about how their network assets will map into this global infrastructure build-out to support as-yet unknowable AI services. Verizon is playing its part to construct the new AI ecosystem, says Szabo. In January, it announced a new suite of solutions and products called AI Connect (Verizon AI Connect) to enable businesses to deploy AI workloads at scale. In tandem, it signed a deal with US cloud hosting outfit Vultr to let space in its network infrastructure for Vultr to expand its compute footprint and GPU-as-a-service offer.\n\nIt has also announced an expansion to a deal with Meta \u201cacross network infrastructure\u2026 to build the AI ecosystem\u201d, in some fashion. Besides, there is new work with Nvidia to \u201creimagine\u201d how GPU-based edge platforms will integrate into its private 5G deployments, as well as a project with Google Cloud around new AI solutions for network maintenance and anomaly detection. This is what the third \u201cbucket\u201d contains. Szabo says: \u201cThe strategy is clear \u2013 to partner with customers like Vultr, or tier-ones like Meta, so they handle the GPU-level stuff and we get them to where they need to go; and as our network programmability advances, for them to use more network services.\u201d\n\nThis discussion about how Verizon Business is using AI to serve enterprise customers is set out below, a bucket at a time. But a quick word from Szabo before we get into all of that, which sets out his company\u2019s position \u2013 and tells a story for the whole operator community about how to get a grip on AI to improve internal operations and also to play in the external ecosystem.\n\nSzabo says: \u201cThese things will happen over a period of time. Everybody has got work to do; some are more advanced than others. But service providers have built all this stuff already. Our challenge is getting it in a way that the new world is used to consuming \u2013 in a more digital-fingertips way. That is the challenge for the telcos: how to take decades of network infrastructure and automate and configure it so it is available at scale. That is where we are making targeted investments. But from a horizontal perspective, I mean, who better to be the hub and the highway \u2013 than the hub and the highway? These partnerships are great for both sides. It allows them to tap into what we have, and it forces us to level up, and modernize.\u201d\n\nAI in customer service support\n\nThe first of these \u201cbuckets\u201d bundles back-end AI to help with customer support functions \u2013 \u201cthe stuff you\u2019re used to hearing about in this space,\u201d says Szabo. The goal, as always with automation, is to improve operational efficiencies; the context, as always with service, is to reduce \u201cfriction\u201d alongside \u2013 in this case, by placating disgruntled customers, calling in because they have issues with networks, systems, devices, applications, and so on. \u201cAny friction we can take out of the system is helpful. And these types of things are really important,\u201d he says.\n\nThe big change, recent and ongoing, with AI in telecoms-based business support systems (BSS), covering all the software that manages customer-facing activities, is to avail the much-maligned interactive voice response (IVR) system with new brain power \u2013 so calls are not just directed to the right department, but to the right person within the department. Szabo explains: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to do [with AI] is to auto-route their problem to the rep with the most experience in that area. It is matchmaking, if you will \u2013 between a service issue and a service rep.\u201d\n\nThe AI crawls an expanding database of service calls, which records the nature of each inquiry, along with the source of the problem and the author of the solution. \u201cIt is not secret stuff; but it has helped tremendously,\u201d says Szabo. As well, Verizon is using AI to sift information \u2013 product manuals, software instructions, network alarms, adjacent BSS and OSS systems \u2013 so staff can solve issues faster. Previously, even with the match-making, it was down to staff to know and find information in the back-end system (\u201con five or six screens\u201d), and to further liaise with domain experts.\n\nSzabo explains: \u201cWith AI, we can level-up the rep to quickly access and digest information, and to deliver answers \u2013 because the AI can siphon through tens-of-thousands of pages of information very quickly. We are seeing a very high rate, in the 90-plus percentile, in terms of the accuracy of the responses.\u201d So how should we grade the AI in these service enhancements? \u201cIt is between early AI and generative AI,\u201d he responds. \u201cWe are figuring out how to use agentic AI to support self-help work for customers, where the AI takes steps [by itself, prompted by the customer].\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAt present, we can give an answer quickly; agentic AI will give customers more power to execute steps and functions \u2013 if they get an answer, say, and choose to take an action as a result, without a care agent getting [involved]. Really, the stuff we\u2019re working on now is more about the execution models in the agentic space.\u201d\n\nAI in product personalization\n\nThe second area of focus for Verizon Business is the personalization of its product suite to meet rising demand \u2013 fast mutating into expectation \u2013 from data-minded businesses, increasingly born-digital, for transparency and control over their digital services. \u201cWe have a good beat on the types of things to level-up customer [service support]; what we need to do is to extend those capabilities into the product suite, itself. They expect low-touch AI management and personalized products, so they don\u2019t have to call up every time they want to make checks and changes,\u201d says Szabo.\n\nAs such the company has been embedding AI into its as-a-service portals so enterprises can understand and troubleshoot the performance of their networks, routers, devices, and apps to bring some two-way dynamism to service management and security, as well as to draw on emerging features in the latest \u2018standalone\u2019 version of 5G (5G SA). This is where \u201clots of time\u201d has gone over the last 24 months, he says.\n\n\u201cWe are leveling-up our infrastructure to provide these tools and capabilities and insights, whether that is through APIs, where they can pull [the network] into their ecosystem to use however they want, or through our own management and configuration tools, where they can get insights and control over their devices and networks. Because they don\u2019t just want us just to proactively let them know; they want to see it for themselves, and have their own eyes on it. They want complete transparency and visibility, and AI lets us give them that.\u201d\n\nHe has an example about this kind of AI chain-of-thought around a sudden data spike on a device in the network. The firm is offering \u201creal-time rating and usage with AI\u201d, he explains, where some root-level AI algorithm prompts actions in response to ML traffic alarms in the network. \u201cIf a device goes rogue, and constantly pings the network and racks up a huge bill, then maybe it has been hacked, or maybe it is just on the wrong plan. But now they can evaluate it, right away \u2013 whereas previously they wouldn\u2019t have the information until they had their bill,\u201d he says.\n\nSo just grade that as an AI exercise, as well. Szabo responds: \u201cIt is early-stage AI insofar as you can take a lot of information, and deliver visibility and insights [about ot]. It is not a one-for-one,\u201d he says, suggesting somehow that its value is more profound, and scalable. The point is it is the same kind of pattern, as with customer support \u2013 where Verizon\u2019s back-end systems are more accessible, because AI is simplifying information and rendering insights. In this case, these are literally more accessible, because they are being opened to enterprises via APIs.\n\nIt is different from just rule-based big data analytics, which has underpinned most service management platforms until now. Szabo responds: \u201cThis correlates [responses across] a variety of data sets \u2013 network usage and performance, location management, cyber security and cyber threats \u2013 to identify potential issues. The network is built, and the first step is to proactively get tools and insights into the hands of customers \u2013 to correlate data as AI. The next step is for customers to use AI to automatically change everything on the network \u2013 when they want.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cBut they don\u2019t have those capabilities yet; those are things we\u2019re investing in now.\u201d\n\nAI in ecosystem building\n\nWhich gets us, quickly, into interesting discussion about the telco\u2019s role in the broader AI ecosystem, and how to make a virtue of its distributed infrastructure, variously incorporating national and regional data centres, metro-edge multi-access edge compute (MEC) sites, and even cell towers and radio equipment. Plus both its fibre backhaul and cellular access networks, of course \u2013 as strung between these properties. This is the third \u201cbucket\u201d, as described by Verizon Business, and it pitches the telco talk about AI as-a-service into this digital gold rush on AI infrastructure.\n\nIn the end, it is about the interplay between this industry, building powerful AI networks, and the big beasts of AI, building powerful AI engines, and how they connect to deliver powerful AI services \u2013 and where and how business is shared between the lines. \u201cEveryone is doing things in this space, but everyone knows they can\u2019t do everything on their own. So the question is: how does everybody work together without stepping on each other\u2019s toes? That is the issue \u2013 that everyone is encroaching on everyone else\u2019s revenue streams,\u201d says Szabo.\n\n\u201cWhich just drags out our ability to quickly-deliver what the market wants; I mean, that is my opinion\u201d, he adds, and he goes on to highlight the work of various of these protagonists to draw the lines, and collaborate on common goals. He flags his firm\u2019s own work to make its data centre assets available for companies to deploy AI hardware, and its new AI Connect suite of products and solutions to \u201cenable businesses to deploy AI workloads at scale\u201d. Google Cloud and Meta are already renting space; it claims a $1 billion sales funnel for its AI Connect offerings.\n\nIt has just signed with cloud hosting firm Vultr, which is to expand its compute footprint and GPU-as-a-service offer via Verizon\u2019s connectivity infrastructure in the US, and to \u201chook directly\u201d into its fibre network. Szabo says: \u201cIt can use its experience [with] customers, and we will power everything on the backend to get it to the co/los, cloud sites, edges. So we become a crucial component for the transport. We will level-up our programmability so customers can go from 1Gbps to 10Gbps \u2013 to 100Gbps, if they need it; they can build the pipes in real time to wherever they want.\u201d\n\nHe zooms out: \u201cWe bring a lot to the table \u2013 if you look at our assets and land; our space, power, and cooling; our networks. We have a ton of traction; our funnel is big in [shared and dedicated] fibre \u2013 just to transport these AI workloads everywhere. It is pretty remarkable; the requests are coming our way.\u201d There is an argument to say operators are lucky, to an extent; that AI workloads require distributed cloud systems for purposes of efficiency and performance, and that telecoms networks already go to most places, and distribute compute power along the way.\n\nIn ways, as well, the opportunity for operators to rent space in their networks and data centres to the rest of the AI ecosystem builds on their original vision for digital services to be sprung from MEC infrastructure. Certainly, there are lessons from the MEC-era, says Szabo \u2013 and also steps that should not be repeated. \u201cMEC was pretty far ahead of its time. The device ecosystem and other things were just not ready. But we know the edge is super critical, and people now understand the values and the outcomes better. But the use cases are different \u2013 MEC versus this.\n\n\u201cIf you just look at MEC as an edge-play to get closer to the customer and the outcome, then there are similarities. But how it is commercialised, and the types of players is very different. Our ability to partner will likely involve us sharing our space with other companies. But it is not just about hyperscalers and telcos; folks can do different things with GPUs at the edge\u2026 A lot of that stuff is still in play \u2013 which is why, for us, the meat and potatoes is the network \u2013 and the space, power, and cooling \u2013 because you need those things just to activate where we go next.\u201d",

            "content": "A vulnerability in Verizon's Call Filter feature allowed customers to access the incoming call logs for another Verizon Wireless number through an unsecured API request.\n\nThe flaw was discovered by security researcher Evan Connelly on February 22, 2025, and was fixed by Verizon sometime in the following month. However, the total period of exposure is unknown.\n\nVerizon's Call Filter app is a free utility that offers users spam detection and automatic call blocking. A paid version (Plus) adds a spam lookup and risk meter, the ability to apply blocks by type of caller, and receive caller ID on unknown numbers.\n\nThe free version of the app comes pre-installed and enabled by default on eligible Android and iOS devices bought directly from Verizon, and is believed to be used on millions of devices.\n\nConnelly told BleepingComputer that he only tested the iOS app. However, he noted that the Android app was also very likely impacted by the same bug, as the issue was with the feature's API rather than the apps themselves.\n\nExposing call histories\n\nWhen using the Call Filter app, Connelly discovered that the app would connect to an API endpoint, https://clr-aqx.cequintvzwecid.com/clr/callLogRetrieval, to retrieve the logged-in user's incoming call history and display it in the app.\n\n\"This endpoint requires a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme and uses an X-Ceq-MDN header to specify a cell phone number to retrieve call history logs for,\" explains Connelly.\n\n\"A JWT has three parts: header, payload, and signature. It's often used for authentication and authorization in web apps.\"\n\nConnelly says the payload includes various data, including the phone number of the logged-in user making the request to the API.\n\nJWT payload\n\nSource: Connelly\n\nHowever, the researcher discovered that the phone number in the JWT payload for the logged-in user was not verified against the phone number whose incoming call logs were being requested.\n\nAs a result, any user could send requests using their own valid JWT token, but replace the X-Ceq-MDN header value with another Verizon phone to retrieve their incoming call history.\n\nExample request sent to the vulnerable API\n\nSource: evanconnelly.github.io\n\nThis flaw is particularly sensitive for high-value targets like politicians, journalists, and law enforcement agents, as their sources, contacts, and daily routines could be mapped out.\n\n\"Call metadata might seem harmless, but in the wrong hands, it becomes a powerful surveillance tool. With unrestricted access to another user's call history, an attacker could reconstruct daily routines, identify frequent contacts, and infer personal relationships,\" explained Connelly.\n\nIt is unclear if rate limiting was in place to prevent mass scraping for millions of subscribers, but Connolly told BleepingComputer he saw no indication of such a mechanism or an API gateway that usually implements a security feature like this.\n\nPoor security practices\n\nAlthough the researcher commends Verizon for its prompt response to his disclosure, he highlighted worrying practices the telecom firm has followed in handling subscribers' call data.\n\nThe vulnerable API endpoint used by Call Filter appears to be hosted on a server owned by a separate telecommunications technology firm called Cequint, which specializes in caller identification services.\n\nCequint's own website is offline, and public information about them is limited, raising concerns about how sensitive Verizon call data is handled.\n\nBleepingComputer contacted Verizon to ask when the flaw was introduced, if it was seen exploited in the past, and if it impacted all Call Filter users but has not received a response at this time.\n\nUpdate 4/3 - A Verizon spokersperson has sent BleepingComputer the below statement:\n\n\"Verizon was made aware of this vulnerability and worked with the third-party app owner on a fix and patch that was pushed in mid-March. While there was no indication that the flaw was exploited, the issue was resolved and only impacted iOS devices. Verizon appreciates the responsible disclosure of the finding by the researcher and takes the security very seriously.\"",

However, a researcher recently found the app vulnerable to a serious security lapse.\n\nAt the core of this issue was the app\u2019s interaction with Verizon\u2019s servers to fetch call history data. A network request sent to the endpoint /clr/callLogRetrieval facilitated this retrieval.\n\nA critical flaw lay in how the app failed to validate that the phone number being queried matched the phone number tied to the signed-in user.\n\nBy modifying the phone number in the request header (X-Ceq-MDN) while keeping a valid authorization token (JWT), an attacker could fetch call log data for any Verizon customer.\n\nThe JWT payload looked like this:\n\n{ \"sub\": \"SIGNED_IN_USER_PHONE_NUMBER_HERE\", \"iat\": \"1740253712\", \"iss\": \"df88f1ed1dfd9a903e4c8dca7f00089e134c6c4e0a566cd565147ba1dadf78a6\", \"secret\": \"REDACTED\", \"alg\": \"ECDSA-256\", \"exp\": \"1740255512\" }\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nCall logs might seem inconsequential, but they are far more revealing than they appear.\n\nMetadata such as timestamps and call durations can paint a picture of an individual\u2019s daily routine, personal relationships, and confidential contacts.\n\nExample Vulnerable Request\n\nFor high-risk individuals like journalists, law enforcement officers, politicians, or domestic abuse survivors, such information falling into the wrong hands could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nThe breach impacts Verizon\u2019s extensive customer base\u2014possibly extending to all subscribers, as the Call Filter service is believed to be enabled by default.\n\nThe findings suggest that the vulnerability was not restricted to specific accounts or user groups.\n\nThe server hosting the vulnerable API appears to be owned by Cequint, a telecom technology company specializing in caller ID services.\n\nThis raises further questions about the security of customer data stored or managed by third-party contractors like Cequint, especially when such data is tied to one of the largest mobile carriers in the U.S.\n\nWhile technical details of this vulnerability are now public, its discovery is a stark reminder of the need for vigilance in protecting digital identities.\n\nWhether through stricter validations, internal audits, or addressing the role of third-party security lapses, it\u2019s clear that carriers like Verizon must double down on keeping customer data safe.",

Verizon opposed the rural carriers\u2019 request to make more locations eligible for funding.\n\nT-Mobile pointed to the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, which, despite the Trump administration\u2019s preference for satellite, appears poised to fund some amount of fiber that could potentially be used by future mobile networks.\n\n\u201cGiven the unprecedented infusion of billions of dollars of federal and state funding as well as ongoing private investment in 5G Fund infrastructure, it is premature for the Commission to proceed with the 5G Fund auction,\u201d the company said in a filing penned by director of regulatory affairs Indra Chalk.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the auction may not be necessary at all,\u201d Chalk said.\n\nT-Mobile is pursuing BEAD dollars in at least Louisiana, where it partnered with a consortium of local fiber providers to win a tentative award. That money, approved in the waning days of the Biden administration, is being held up as the Trump administration mulls potential changes to program rules, namely shifting money away from fiber deployments.\n\nOther states haven\u2019t put forward their selected projects amid the uncertainty, but some, like Louisiana, were looking to boost mobile coverage with their BEAD cash, in part through pushing fiber deeper into unserved areas.\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a commissioner at the time, dissented when the 5G Fund rules were adopted in August 2024, largely objecting on the same grounds as T-Mobile.\n\nThe rural carriers had also asked the agency to make more areas eligible for 5G Fund money, both by increasing the speed threshold and by using coverage maps that assume an in-vehicle user rather than a stationary user standing outside, and to increase the fund\u2019s budget.\n\nT-Mobile agreed solely on the timeline ground, saying the agency didn\u2019t need to address any other arguments. Verizon didn't address thetiming issue, but asked the FCC to deny the requests to expand eligibility and spending.\n\nBetween the two, the \u201cproposed change would dramatically expand the eligible areas,\u201d Verizon wrote in a filing signed by Will Johnson, the company's senior vice president and deputy general counsel. The FCC should not address the risk of stranding locations without adequate mobile coverage \u201cby expanding the 5G Fund as petitioners propose, which is guaranteed to waste much of the budget on large areas that already have good coverage,\u201d the company argued.\n\nA separate group representing smaller wireless carriers, the Competitive Carriers Association, took the agency to court over the issue in February, asking judges to toss the 5G Fund order. The FCC asked judges to put the case on hold while it handles the petitions for reconsideration, which the court agreed to do on March 19. The agency noted that Carr dissented from the order.\n\n\u201cIf the Commission were to grant the petitions for reconsideration in whole or in part, that decision could render moot or significantly alter the issues raised by the petition for review in this case,\u201d the agency wrote.",

Credit: Falls Township police\n\nTwo men are wanted on charges including conspiracy to commit theft after police suspect they stole Verizon cable wiring.\n\nFalls Township police said they were dispatched to the area of Waste Gas Fabricating on New Bold Road at 5:59 p.m. Saturday for a report of a suspicious vehicle. A caller reported a U-Haul truck had been parked at the end of the property for three hours, and requested police due to recent wire thefts in the area.\n\nOfficers found a 2014 GMC U-Haul truck with an Arizona license plate parked at the end of the driveway. On the ground near the truck, officers found a bundle of loose wires and observed a severed electric pole cable, police said.\n\nRobert Oestreich, 44, of Bristol Township\u2019s Croydon section, was found nearby gathering metal wiring, police said.\n\nOestreich reportedly told officers the U-Haul was his and that there was more wire inside.\n\nInside the truck, officers found bundles of loose metal wires and two black trash bags containing more metal wiring wrapped in a black outer sheath, appearing to be cable wire, police said.\n\nOestreich denied owning the wire in the trash bags and pointed toward where he was found when asked who it belonged to, police said.\n\nFile photo.\n\nOestreich was carrying the U-Haul key, power saw blades, a flashlight, a box cutter, and a clear plastic baggie containing a white crystal substance suspected to be methamphetamine.\n\nOestreich told officers he was with a friend named \u201cChuck,\u201d police said.\n\nJoseph Shaffer, 53, of Levittown, was later located by officers.\n\nShaffer told officers there were tools used to cut wire in a bag down the road, police said.\n\nLaw enforcement said they found a stack of black outer sheaths with multicolored copper wiring inside between a cut hole in a fence. On top of the stack was a black backpack with large pruning shear handles sticking out of the top.\n\nPolice recovered approximately 30 black outer sheaths with multicolored copper wiring inside, confirmed to be Verizon property.\n\nVerizon reported that the theft and damage will cost $5,000, police said.\n\nOestreich and Shaffer are wanted on warrants related to conspiracy to commit theft, possession of an instrument of crime, and related offenses.\n\nAnyone with information on their location is asked to contact 9-1-1, if appropriate, or the non-emergency number at 215-328-8519.

            "content": "Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:\n\n18% = US$18b \u00f7 US$101b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.\n\nView our latest analysis for Verizon Communications\n\nDoes Verizon Communications Have A Good ROE?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Verizon Communications has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Telecom industry (16%).\n\nNYSE:VZ Return on Equity April 2nd 2025\n\nThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications.\n\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nCombining Verizon Communications' Debt And Its 18% Return On Equity\n\nVerizon Communications clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.44. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.",

Previously, she worked at DPReview.\n\nVisible, the budget wireless brand owned by Verizon, is offering a new premium plan that looks like a heck of a deal compared to its parent company\u2019s offerings.\n\nThe new Visible Plus Pro plan (I didn\u2019t say the name was good) costs $45 per month. For that price you get unlimited 5G Ultrawideband (UW) data, which is an awfully good deal when you consider that Verizon\u2019s own entry-level unlimited plan, Unlimited Welcome, starts at $65 per month and doesn\u2019t include 5G UW.\n\nThis new Plus Pro plan also comes without throttling. Many lower-cost carrier plans and MVNOs tend to offer a certain allotment of \u201cpremium\u201d data. Once you exceed your allowance, you might see slowdowns at times when the network is busy. But Visible\u2019s fine print states that both its Plus and Plus Pro plan are \u201cnot subject to any data prioritization limitations.\u201d So that rules.\n\nIt gets better: the Plus Pro plan includes unlimited hotspot usage at up to 15 Mbps. Verizon\u2019s basic plan doesn\u2019t include any hotspot data, just the option to add it for an extra $10 per month. There\u2019s also 4K video streaming and service for one cellular smartwatch included. You can probably guess what I\u2019m going to say next, but just to reiterate, Verizon\u2019s basic unlimited plan doesn\u2019t include any of that.\n\nThis would all be less of a good deal if Verizon puts Visible traffic on a lower network tier than its own postpaid customers. Network operators commonly put different kinds of customers on certain service tiers called Quality of Service Class Indicators, or QCIs. This helps with overall traffic prioritization when there\u2019s congestion, usually putting first responders on the fastest tier.\n\nVerizon didn\u2019t immediately respond to my question about Visible Plus Pro\u2019s QCI, but Android Authority\u2019s comprehensive comparison between Visible and Verizon suggests that Visible\u2019s premium plan is actually assigned a higher-priority QCI than Verizon\u2019s Unlimited Welcome \u2014 at least, that\u2019s been the case in the past. We\u2019ll update this article if Verizon responds to our request.\n\nIt\u2019s all too rare to read about an ISP\u2019s new plan and think \u201cHuh, that sounds like a good deal, actually.\u201d But that\u2019s the case here, even after going through the fine print.",

I like the CNN anchors but suspect they are being told what they can and can\u2019t say.

Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nBased in New York, Verizon Communications Inc. was formed through the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. The company offers communication services in the form of local phone service, long distance, wireless and data services. In Jan 2006, Verizon completed its merger with MCI Corporation, a leader in long distance and data networking. With the acquisition of Alltel Wireless Corp. in early 2009, Verizon has surpassed AT&T Inc. as the largest wireless carrier in the North America, serving millions of customers nationwide.\n\nVZ sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Value Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of B. Compared to the Wireless National industry's P/E of 22X, shares of Verizon Communications are trading at a forward P/E of 9.7X. VZ also has a PEG Ratio of 4.5, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 5.1X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 1.4X.\n\nMany value investors pay close attention to a company's earnings as well.

They also adjusted the Visible+ plan and reduced its price by $10/mo.\n\nWhile it is April 1, this appears to be a very real change, with a full press release, website adjustment, etc. There isn\u2019t anything silly about this change, so assume it is the real deal. Just read it and shake your head at Verizon for announcing it today.\n\nOK, so Visible used to be so great because they offered a single plan that basically had all of the features you needed at a relatively small price. You paid monthly with no contract and had access to Verizon\u2019s network. In recent years, Visible added a 2nd plan (Visible+), but kept things affordable and only added features. Today, we\u2019re getting a third plan with changes to the + and I still think all is well, even if there is new complexity we didn\u2019t once have.\n\nHere\u2019s the new Visible plan line-up: Visible ($25), Visible+ ($35), and Visible+ Pro ($45).\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Quite a bit! I highlighted the areas above to focus on.\n\nFirst off, the cheapest Visible plan has no changes. Visible is listing free 2-day device shipping as an item now, but that\u2019s not really much of a feature.\n\nFor the Visible+ plan that is down to $35 (from $45), there are a couple of items to point out. The unlimited premium 5G data used to be capped at 50GB per month before the network slowed you, but it is now truly unlimited according to Verizon. That\u2019s a pretty substantial change there. They are also upping the video streaming to 1080p (from 720p). However, they are taking away global calling and texting to countries (Mexico and Canada still included). Hotspot remains unlimited and at 10Mbps.\n\nFor this new Visible+ Pro plan, you get truly unlimited premium 5G data, but for streaming you can now go up to 4K UHD. Hotspot is capable of 15Mbps speeds and is still unlimited. This plan takes the calling to 85+ countries and texting to 200+ countries from the old Visible+ plan. It also adds a 2nd Global Pass per month.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it \u2013 these new plans are already live if you\u2019d like to switch. That $35 plan is quite tempting.\n\nShop Visible Plans\n\n// Verizon",

(NYSE:VZ) stands against other best very cheap stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nComing off 2 years of healthy broader market performance (~26% total return in 2023, ~25% in 2024), the US Bank Wealth Management believes that the S&P 500 valuations kicked off 2025 at elevated levels. In 2025, stocks continue to face a volatile environment, and in mid-March, the S&P 500 index witnessed a correction (a fall of 10% or more). Despite this, the index\u2019s expected P/E ratio remains marginally above the historic 5-year and 10-year average, says the firm. As per Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director, U.S. Bank Asset Management, it\u2019s critical that, in 2025, earnings growth remains on track.\n\nCorporate Earnings Projections in 2025\n\nUS Bank Wealth Management believes that current market projections hint at the 11.5% S&P 500 earnings growth in 2025 versus the prior year. This number is subject to change. However, Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Asset Management, mentioned that when considering the potential impact of tariffs and other issues, it is difficult to expect that 2025 earnings would meet the current projections. Haworth says that the impact of tariffs on company profits is expected to be mixed. Companies that are more dependent on importing goods manufactured overseas can witness more challenges.\n\nIn comparison, the smaller companies, which are not as dependent on foreign trade, are expected to be better placed to mitigate the impact of the trade environment. Because they are not selling in the foreign markets and are not relying on foreign goods, smaller companies can have more pricing power, opines Haworth. This can equate to a healthier earnings picture.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nTechnology Sector Remains Well-Placed\n\nJPMorgan believes that uncertainty related to the trade and other factors of the US administration\u2019s policy agenda continue to lead to a wait and see attitude from businesses and households. Given that household and corporate balance sheets remain relatively healthy, this attitude is expected to be consistent with a slowness in the broader US activity rather than a recession. Coming to the technology sector, in most part, the balance sheets are in healthy shape, with valuations based on forward earnings sitting at a decent place, says JP Morgan. As per the investment firm, these valuations still demonstrate anticipations for very strong 20%+ earnings growth from the US technology sector in 2025.",

            "content": "Investors are shifting their strategies due to rising market uncertainty caused by ongoing tariff disputes and widespread economic concerns. They are seeking safety in historically defensive sectors, and as a result, the telecommunications sector is experiencing a resurgence of interest. The double-digit growth of telecom giants Verizon NYSE: VZ and AT&T NYSE: T over the past three months highlights the renewed attention on these companies.\n\nThese established telecom titans may be emerging as crucial defensive anchors for portfolios navigating the complexities of the current economic climate. The search for stability and reliable yield appears to put these familiar names in the spotlight.\n\nGet Verizon Communications alerts: Sign Up\n\nWhy the Telcom Sector Shines in Stormy Weather\n\nThe telecommunications sector is traditionally seen as a defensive investment, particularly appealing during economic downturns or market instability. This is due to the essential nature of telecommunication services; demand for connectivity remains relatively stable even during economic contractions, ensuring consistent revenue streams for major carriers, often based on recurring monthly subscriptions.\n\nEstablished telecommunication companies like Verizon and AT&T also offer appealing dividend yields. These companies provide a reliable income stream and a buffer against share price declines when market appreciation is uncertain. This combination of stable revenue and consistent dividends reinforces the sector's attractiveness as a haven during economic turbulence, explaining the historical trend of capital flowing toward telecommunications during periods of market anxiety.\n\nVerizon: Connecting With Confidence\n\nVerizon Communications Dividend Payments Dividend Yield 5.94% Annual Dividend $2.71 Dividend Increase Track Record 20 Years Annualized 3-Year Dividend Growth 1.93% Dividend Payout Ratio 65.46% Next Dividend Payment May. 1 VZ Dividend History\n\nVerizon Communications recently provided tangible evidence supporting its defensive credentials, delivering strong operational and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. The company successfully met its 2024 financial guidance and reiterated a positive outlook for 2025.\n\nFourth-quarter 2024 total operating revenue climbed 1.6 percent year-over-year to $35.7 billion, contributing to a full-year revenue figure of $134.8 billion. Growth was notably driven by wireless service revenue, which reached $20.0 billion in the fourth quarter, marking 18 consecutive quarters of sequential growth, fueled by pricing actions and the expansion of fixed wireless access (FWA).\n\nVerizon added nearly 1 million postpaid mobile and broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter, including 568,000 postpaid phone net additions and 373,000 FWA net additions, bringing its FWA subscriber base to nearly 4.6 million. Reinforcing its commitment to shareholders, Verizon declared a quarterly dividend of 67.75 cents per share, highlighting its track record of 18 consecutive years of dividend increases and a current yield of around 6.02%.\n\nThe company also announced plans to redeem approximately $984.8 million of its 2.625% Notes due 2026, further managing its debt profile. Verizon\u2019s analyst community sentiment reflects cautious optimism, with a moderate buy consensus rating and an average price target suggesting modest upside potential.\n\nAT&T: Reconnecting Value\n\nAT&T Dividend Payments Dividend Yield 3.85% Annual Dividend $1.11 Annualized 3-Year Dividend Growth -18.89% Dividend Payout Ratio 74.50% Next Dividend Payment May. 1 T Dividend History\n\nAT&T exceeded Q4 2024 earnings per share (EPS) estimates with an adjusted EPS of $0.54 compared to consensus estimates of $0.48. The company reported healthy subscriber growth, adding 1.7 million postpaid phone net additions and over 1 million AT&T Fiber subscribers. The company is framing a narrative around transformation and focused growth to reinforce its position as a compelling defensive investment.\n\nDespite a slight year-over-year decrease in full-year 2024 revenue to $122.3 billion, CEO John Stankey highlighted the company's strategic focus on expanding its 5G and fiber networks as essential for long-term value and returns. Through cost-saving initiatives, AT&T also aims to achieve over $3 billion in run-rate savings by the end of 2027 and plans to start share repurchases in the second half of 2025 as it nears its net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA target.\n\nAT&T\u2019s dividend yield of approximately 3.94%, while lower than Verizon's, has a sustainable payout ratio. Recent stock performance has been positive, reaching new 52-week highs, and several analysts have upgraded the stock or raised price targets, leading to a moderate buy consensus rating and indicating increasing market confidence in AT&T's strategic direction and financial outlook.\n\nChoosing Your Connection\n\nVerizon and AT&T exhibit distinct characteristics when evaluated as defensive stocks. Verizon's dividend yield of approximately 6.02% surpasses AT&T's 3.94%, attracting income-focused investors, especially considering Verizon's consistent dividend growth history compared to AT&T's recent dividend reductions.\n\nVerizon also appears more attractively valued with a lower P/E ratio of 10.87 based on trailing earnings compared to AT&T's 18.92. While AT&T's projected earnings growth of 6.07% exceeds Verizon's 3.62%, both companies carry substantial debt, typical of the telecom sector, with comparable debt-to-equity ratios (AT&T at 1.00, Verizon at 1.21). Financially, Verizon outperformed AT&T in 2024 with higher annual revenue ($134.8B vs. $122.3B) and net income ($17.5B vs. $11.0B).\n\nBoth stocks hold a moderate buy consensus rating, but average price targets suggest potential upside for Verizon, while AT&T's target is slightly below current levels, reflecting its recent positive performance.\n\nTelecom's Enduring Signal\n\nVerizon and AT&T's stock performance and heightened investor interest signal a potential resurgence of traditional defensive telecom stocks during a time of market uncertainty and economic headwinds. Both companies have displayed operational strength, with Verizon demonstrating consistent growth and shareholder returns and AT&T focusing on its core connectivity assets.\n\nTheir healthy dividend yields are particularly appealing in a volatile or yield-scarce market.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the sector's significant debt levels, competitive pressures, and regulatory landscape. While not wholly immune to market risks, the essential nature of their services offers some protection during turbulent times.\n\nFor investors seeking to strengthen their portfolio's defensive stance, Verizon and AT&T may serve as reliable anchors, providing relative stability and income generation in an increasingly uncertain market. They could be the market's \"unlikely heroes\" for those prioritizing capital preservation and yield.\n\nBefore you consider Verizon Communications, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Verizon Communications wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Verizon Communications currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

The nation's largest wireless carrier had sued Ocean City in 2023 after it was denied an application that the company needed to install equipment on the roof of a privately owned building. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, was settled by both parties and last Thursday a resolution was passed approving the terms of the settlement by the Ocean City City Council.'s lawsuit alleged that the city violated federal telecommunication laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the City Council introduced an ordinance allowing Verizon to build its cell tower on city-owned land on Bay Avenue. On April 10th, the public will get to comment on the ordinance and the City Council will vote on adopting it. If approved, the carrier will get to build a 120-foot cell tower on the southern end of the island.

Instead, with the settlement, a new cell tower will be built in Ocean City which should improve connectivity for Verizon customers in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon offers both mobile and business internet, phone, and TV services.

            "content": "Altria, Verizon, and Chubb Limited are all insulated from Trump's unpredictable tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed tariffs on some of America's largest trading partners drove many investors away from companies that rely heavily on imports, exports, and other types of cross-border commerce. It also drove them toward tariff-proof companies that wouldn't be significantly affected by those levies.\n\nMany of those resilient stocks aren't high-growth plays, but a lot of them are reliable stalwarts that trade at low valuations while doling out attractive dividends. Let's take a look at three tariff-proof dividend stocks that still look attractive in this unpredictable market: Altria (MO 1.47%), Verizon (VZ 2.09%), and Chubb Limited (CB 0.96%).\n\n1. Altria\n\nAltria, the largest tobacco company in America, spun off its overseas business as Philip Morris International back in 2008. Altria's flagship Marlboro brand and other brands controlled 45.9% of the U.S. retail cigarette market in 2024. It also sells cigars, snus, e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco capsules, and other products.\n\nAltria might initially seem like a wobbly investment, since adult smoking rates in the U.S. have been dropping for decades. However, the company has consistently offset that pressure by raising its prices, cutting costs, and buying back more shares to boost its earnings per share (EPS). It's also been expanding its smokeless portfolio to curb its long-term dependence on cigarettes.\n\nAnalysts expect Altria's adjusted EPS to grow 4% in 2025 and 3% in 2026. That growth should be driven by the expansion of its Njoy e-cigarette business, On nicotine pouches, and ongoing price hikes and cost-cutting strategies. The stock still looks cheap at 11 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 7.1%. It's raised its payout annually since 2008.\n\nAltria is naturally insulated from higher tariffs because it does nearly all of its business in America. Even if inflation stays sticky and interest rates remain elevated, its higher dividend yield should continue to lock in more income-oriented investors.\n\n2. Verizon\n\nVerizon, one of the largest telecom companies in America, is another tariff-proof play because it generates most of its profits from its wireless and wireline services. It doesn't need to buy and sell products from overseas markets like China.\n\nIn 2023, Verizon faced major challenges as it struggled to gain new wireless customers and repeatedly slashed its prices to stay competitive. But in 2024, it more than doubled its postpaid phone net additions as its total wireless churn rate declined to 1.62%. It attributed that recovery to the localization of its incentives and marketing campaigns, the expansion of its customizable \"myPlans,\" and the growth of its distribution business with Walmart. Verizon still relied on big promotions to attract new customers, but it also aggressively cut its costs to offset that pressure.\n\nAnalysts expect Verizon's adjusted EPS to grow 2% in 2025 and 4% in 2026. Its stock trades at just 9 times forward earnings, and it pays an attractive forward yield of 6.1%. It's raised its payout annually for 18 consecutive years. That low valuation and high yield should make it a popular safe haven stock, regardless of what happens with the tariffs.\n\n3. Chubb Limited\n\nChubb, the largest publicly traded provider of property, supplemental, health, and casualty insurance policies, is another tariff-proof stock. Tariffs won't directly affect insurance companies because they don't import or export any products.\n\nEven if the tariffs throttle the growth of the broader economy, most individuals won't cancel their insurance policies to save a few dollars. Instead, it becomes even more crucial to hold reliable policies as a hedge against financial ruin.\n\nChubb's core operating income per share (excluding any tax benefits) rose 30% in 2023 and grew another 13% in 2024. Its consolidated net premiums increased 13.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2024, even as the macro headwinds rattled many other sectors. Analysts expect its core operating income per share to dip 6% in 2025 but rise 22% in 2026.\n\nChubb currently trades at just 14 times forward earnings. The company pays a decent forward dividend yield of 1.2%, and it's raised its payout for 32 consecutive years. It isn't an exciting investment, but it's a Buffett-approved stock that should easily weather higher tariffs, protracted inflation, high interest rates, and other nasty macro headwinds.",

            "content": "Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Verizon Communications, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.097 = US$31b \u00f7 (US$385b - US$65b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 9.7%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.6% average generated by the Telecom industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications\n\nNYSE:VZ Return on Capital Employed March 29th 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Verizon Communications compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Verizon Communications .\n\nSo How Is Verizon Communications' ROCE Trending?\n\nUnfortunately, the trend isn't great with ROCE falling from 13% five years ago, while capital employed has grown 30%. Usually this isn't ideal, but given Verizon Communications conducted a capital raising before their most recent earnings announcement, that would've likely contributed, at least partially, to the increased capital employed figure. Verizon Communications probably hasn't received a full year of earnings yet from the new funds it raised, so these figures should be taken with a grain of salt. Also, we found that by looking at the company's latest EBIT, the figure is within 10% of the previous year's EBIT so you can basically assign the ROCE drop primarily to that capital raise.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Verizon Communications' ROCE\n\nIn summary, Verizon Communications is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 9.0% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.",

Credit: Doug Hardy / CTNewsJunkie\n\nHARTFORD, CT \u2014 A proposed settlement between state consumer protection authorities, Verizon, and Frontier is a win for consumers, according to the state Office of the Consumer Counsel.\n\nThe deal, filed this week with the state\u2019s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, gives consumers much of what they had been seeking, such as extended grace periods for vulnerable citizens and identification requirements for company representatives visiting people\u2019s homes. The proposed settlement comes as Verizon Communications is in the process of acquiring Frontier.\n\n\u201cMy team and I fought for lower bills, better policies, stronger oversight \u2013 and we won,\u201d said Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just negotiate. We secured real savings, real protections, and real accountability for Connecticut residents. We also obtained commitments to ensure that the utility infrastructure on poles is administered efficiently and safely. I am confident our regulators will see the merits of this proposal,\u201d\n\nThe companies filed a joint petition in November 2024 with PURA through which, if approved, Verizon would acquire Frontier as a wholly owned subsidiary at the holding-company level, according to Coleman. If that petition is approved, the initiatives included in the proposal filed this week will go into effect.\n\n\u201cI am so proud that so many of our conditions are inspired directly by consumer complaints,\u201d said Rhiana Ash, a research analyst with the Office of Consumer Counsel.\n\nAsh said there will be a requirement that Verizon employees who go to a consumers\u2019 homes wear proper identification to help consumers feel safe.\n\nAnother provision is a requirement for the company to provide advance notice to customers before copper phone lines are retired so they don\u2019t have service disruptions, while another creates a grace period of 20 extra days before service is disconnected for nonpayment for the elderly, blind and disabled.\n\nFor four years after the acquisition, Verizon also will supply free backup units to customers who are migrated from copper to fiber as part of Verizon\u2019s network transformation program. The backup units will be powered by D batteries and the first set of batteries would be free, according to the proposal.\n\nAs part of the cost savings included in the settlement, starting 180 days after the closing, both Frontier and Verizon would no longer charge any consumer using a regulated wireline voice service and they will also remove from any Connecticut tariff, the \u201cFrontier Road Work Recovery Surcharge.\u201d\n\nColeman\u2019s office said that provision would save the state\u2019s consumers $3 a month, and an estimated $2.2 million in annual collective savings.\n\nAlso for four years after the transaction closes, Verizon will extend eligibility to the Verizon Forward program. That program includes discounted prices for Verizon Home Internet services for those who qualify for the federal school lunch program and the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, according to the settlement.\n\nUnder the proposal, Verizon also will provide annual reports on fiber deployment progress, and include digital and copper phone services in Verizon\u2019s quality reports. Verizon, according to Coleman, will also be subject to enhanced reporting to PURA, the Office of Consumer Counsel and the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection on 911 service disruptions.\n\nBurt Cohen, staff attorney with the OCC, said the proposal got overwhelming support from all the participants in the proceeding.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud of what we, as a team, the three of us, were able to accomplish to protect Connecticut consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nPURA is expected to issue a draft decision by May 12, with the final decision expected in June.\n\nAccording to the OCC, Frontier provides traditional telephone services across most of the state, while Verizon serves western Greenwich, while both companies offer broadband, internet, voice, and in some areas, video services, according to Coleman\u2019s office.\n\nIn September 2024, Frontier and Verizon announced they had entered into a merger agreement. Company officials have said the transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of 2026.",

            "content": "ZDNET's key takeaways The TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G is a full-color, color paper, and ink paper tablet available at Verizon for $239.\n\nIt's a great entertainment tablet for daily use that also functions very well as an e-reader.\n\nAlthough the screen is versatile, don't expect the graphics to compare to those on an iPad or other high-end tablets. View now at Verizon\n\nFor a limited time, Verizon is running an offer for the TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G that nets you $100 off the tablet when you purchase it with an eligible 5G Android phone.\n\nReading has always been my favorite way to unwind before bed, and for 13 years, Kindles were my go-to e-readers. But after trying TCL's Nxtpaper technology last year, I haven't looked back.\n\nAlso: The best Amazon Spring Sale deals live now\n\nThe TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G has been a mainstay in my household for the past several months, but it felt like an upgrade almost immediately. Within hours of setting it up, I gave my daughter my old Kindle, and my husband got my old iPad.\n\nThe TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G's display smoothly transitions from regular mode to color paper or ink paper, whether you're reading, scrolling on social media, watching videos, or playing a game. TCL's Nxtpaper technology isn't the same as E Ink, which uses electrophoretic technology to create a monochromatic image.\n\nAlso: The best Android tablets of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nInstead, Nxtpaper is a paper-like display that helps reduce eye strain and improves readability over traditional screens. The display also reduces blue light, doesn't have a conventional backlight, and eliminates flickering, making it easy on the eyes while displaying the different types of content you'd expect from a flagship tablet or smartphone.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nThe lack of a backlight and the display's frosted finish reduce glare and reflections, contributing to better energy efficiency and longer battery life. Using several anti-reflective and anti-glare layers, TCL's Nxtpaper enhances readability in different conditions, so you can enjoy that bestseller on a bright day at the beach or by the pool. A front light panel evenly illuminates the screen and helps maintain a comfortable viewing experience.\n\nAlso: This $200 Android is the only smartphone at CES that you should care about\n\nE Ink, in turn, doesn't traditionally transition from monochromatic to full color and has a slower refresh rate. Though there are color E Ink displays, they're not as vibrant or suitable for multimedia content.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nThe TCL Tab 10 Nxpaper is an entertainment tablet that lets you take your essentials anywhere. It's not meant to replace a brand-new $1,000 iPad, but it can replace an e-reader and an older iPad model, which was my case.\n\nI'm not a tablet power user. I don't need a tablet with strong processing power to replace my MacBook Pro or iMac for video editing or graphic design; I mainly use tablets for entertainment. This includes streaming video on YouTube or a subscription service, reading the news, making notes and lists, catching up on baseball, checking the weather, and playing some games. For all of those use cases, this tablet works well.\n\nAlso: The best reading tablets in 2025: From Kindle To Apple\n\nI sometimes work on my tablet, but as a writer, I only need a keyboard and a reliable note-taking or word-processing app, which are easy to use on this TCL tablet.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nWhen I first tested this device, I wasn't sure what to expect. I had read about TCL's Nxtpaper but hadn't had a chance to test it until this tablet. When I first got my hands on the TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G tablet, I was surprised with the display's versatility and how easily you could switch from regular mode to color paper to ink paper, the latter being the most similar to what you might expect from an e-reader.\n\nThe very first app I downloaded was Kindle. I was excited to see how this tablet would feel as an e-reader, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nAlso: One of the best tablets for watching movies is not from a brand you'd expect\n\nA Kindle e-reader is a single-purpose device, so upgrading to a tablet with a similar display and the benefits of a faster refresh rate and processor was a pleasure. After using the same Kindle for six years, I was blown away by the simple fact that I could breeze through the Kindle app as I would on any other tablet, while the TCL Nxtpaper display looks as good as any e-reader.\n\nThe TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G has its front camera located on the landscape edge. Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nAfter reading for about an hour, I made up my mind. I reset the old 10th-generation Kindle, set it up with Amazon Kids for my seven-year-old, and never looked back. Even better, because now my kid is reading more than ever. During the first three days of using the Kindle, she read for four and a half hours. She's been reading for a few years but now dedicates at least 40 minutes of reading each night before bed on her own, whereas before, she'd read maybe 20 minutes a day during the school week.\n\nAlso: One of the best Samsung tablets I've tested is not a flagship (and it's on sale)\n\nThe TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G is also perfectly capable of performing the tasks my regular iPad did at home and on the go. Part of being a parent means sitting on the sidelines for hours a week while the kids attend extracurricular activities that cost an arm and a leg.\n\nThis tablet has become my new iPad and Kindle while I'm killing time. Plus, if I have a deadline, I can continue my work in Docs; if I'm bored, I can stream on Netflix or scroll through TikTok; and if I'm looking to relax, I can read the latest novel I've downloaded from Kindle Unlimited.\n\nThe convenience of two devices in one made it easy to give my husband my old iPad on the same day I set up the TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G. While the Android experience differs from an iPad, I've encountered minimal bugs and inconveniences. I can still work and play on the TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G, use a split screen, and stream videos flawlessly.\n\nLooking for the next best product? Get expert reviews and editor favorites with ZDNET Recommends.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nThe TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G is perfect for everyday use. This $239 tablet isn't looking to win any benchmark competitions with high-end devices, but it's an outstanding tablet for the price, especially if you like using an e-reader. But if you're looking to buy a new device from Verizon, the carrier will discount up to $100 off the TCL Tab 10, which makes it a fantastic tablet deal.\n\nThe TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper 5G tablet is available at Verizon for $239 prepaid or $6.66 monthly for 36 months. TCL sells a T-Pen Stylus for $40 (I plan to pick one up). Verizon plans start at $30 monthly, which isn't cheap. The data plan option is best suited for those who often use the tablet on the go, outside the comforts of Wi-Fi.\n\nI'm keeping the TCL Tab 10 Nxtpaper, data plan or not because I use it mainly around the house. If I use a tablet or laptop somewhere without Wi-Fi, I'm okay with using my iPhone as a hotspot.\n\nWhen will this deal expire?\n\nDeals are subject to sell out or expire anytime, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings.

            "content": "2024 was a big year for customer experience enhancements on behalf of Verizon\u2019s customers.\n\nVerizon launched an entirely new customer experience organization designed to address customer pain points and go beyond expectations, leveraged AI to build a whole new level of service and responsiveness - and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWhile the list of opportunities is long, there are two specific AI innovations that Verizon is especially focused on for customer experience: agentic AI and specialized language models. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each one:\n\nAgentic AI\n\nAgentic AI takes the intertwining of artificial intelligence and human agents one step further by giving AI \"agency\" to help take on even more tasks. For growth companies like Verizon, agentic AI will create opportunities for faster customer resolutions with less friction.\n\nIt will be another tool that takes some of the workload off our employees so they can focus on more important areas, like providing the personal touch and human connection that only we can provide.\n\nBut not every customer wants to talk to a service agent. What they really want, in many cases, is to have their problems solved quickly and easily. Issues like refunds and service changes aren\u2019t particularly complicated.\n\nIf we can resolve a problem or fulfill a request in seconds using AI, it might be the better approach for certain situations. And automation doesn\u2019t mean a more generic experience.\n\nAgentic AI can analyze millions of data points including the customer\u2019s device history, service preferences, and situational context, and apply problem solving techniques that are insightful and relevant to the customer. Instead of one-size-fits all, it\u2019s the custom size that fits one.\n\nSpecialized language models (SLMs)\n\nUnlike large language models (LLMs) trained on general text data, SLMs are fine-tuned on specific domains, offering enhanced accuracy and efficiency for domain-specific tasks, and they do it in a cost and energy efficient manner.\n\nFrom telecom and healthcare to finance and legal, SLMs will be streamlining processes and improving customer experiences across the board.\n\nI can imagine a time in the near future when we will be able to apply SLMs to specific elements of every interaction we have with the customer. While AI has already given us a measurable boost in key performance metrics, it\u2019s still not perfect.\n\nSLMs should allow us to use our data sets in a way that can zero in on what works best in any given situation. For example, we know generally what customers want, but with SLMs we\u2019ll be able to anticipate what a customer may be expecting and tailor our offers to provide them with the best option proactively. That\u2019s the kind of hyper-personalized experience we are aiming for.\n\nThe next frontier\n\nAgentic AI and SLMs will unlock a new level of understanding, accuracy, efficiency and customer experience that will allow companies to not just keep pace with customer expectations but make improvements that set a whole new standard.\n\nConsider it a VIP pass to a smoother, more intuitive experience, where every interaction feels tailored, and every solution hits the mark. I believe these two new areas of combined tech and capability will accelerate and further elevate the way we think about how best to serve our customers.\n\nBrian Higgins is chief customer experience officer for Verizon\u2019s consumer group.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Why These 15 Telecom Stocks Are Surging In 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)stands against other telecom stocks that are surging in 2025.\n\nThe telecom sector has seen many ups and downs in the past few years. Post-COVID, these stocks declined even more due to the inflation wave and the subsequent interest rate hikes. Telecommunication companies usually have significant debt on their balance sheets due to infrastructure CapEx, and they were among the hardest hit.\n\nHowever, rates are now slowly coming down, and these stocks are also starting to bottom out and turn a corner. Many telecom stocks are still profitable and pay dividends. Falling bond yields are making them even more attractive. It\u2019s a good idea to keep tabs on which telecom stocks are spearheading the gains so far this year.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, I screened the best-performing telecom stocks year-to-date.\n\nI will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWhy Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) Is Surging In 2025?\n\nA smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 74\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) needs little introduction. It is one of the leading telecom companies in the U.S.\n\nThe stock is up significantly so far in 2025 as the company has been recovering from a multi-year decline. The decline was mostly due to interest rate increases, and as rates slowly come down and the company adjusts to the higher interest rate environment, the stock is also rising.\n\nAlso, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reaffirmed its financial targets for 2025. It projects wireless service revenue growth of 2.0% to 2.8% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 2% to 3.5%, along with FCF between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\nVerizon (NYSE:VZ)\u2019s investments in building the most robust 5G network in North America are paying off as it reported strong subscriber growth in its broadband segment, including a record 26% year-over-year increase in total subscribers during late 2024.\n\nThe consensus price target of $46.53 implies 6.76% upside.",

            "content": "Representatives from Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T asked Montana lawmakers Friday to pass a bill that would offer them a property tax break if they expand their Montana networks, saying a lighter tax load on wireless infrastructure would encourage them to invest in reaching difficult-to-serve rural areas.\n\nThe proposal, Senate Bill 534, would add wireless infrastructure such as cell towers to an existing tax break available to companies that expand their wired broadband networks. Shortly after the bill wrapped its initial public hearing before the Senate Taxation Committee on Friday, the committee voted 7-1 to advance it for debate on the Senate floor. In order to become law this year, it needs to clear the Senate by April 5.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, and other supporters argued at Friday\u2019s hearing that extending the treatment currently on the books for wired telecom companies to wireless providers is a matter of providing fair treatment to different types of communications technology. They also said it\u2019s a smart way to address the business challenges involved in serving Montanans who are often scattered across the state\u2019s vast landscape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to beam signal from a tower into a lot of areas of Montana than it is to plow fiber,\u201d said Mike Green, representing Verizon.\n\nNo opponents spoke against SB 534 Friday. A similar bill came close to passing the Legislature in 2023 before being caught short by late-session procedural wrangling.\n\nRELATED Promoting rural broadband with tax breaks Senate Bill 51 aims to address a troublesome gap in Montana\u2019s infrastructure: places where residents still don\u2019t have access to reliable broadband internet.\n\nThe existing broadband property tax break, passed in 2021 via that year\u2019s Senate Bill 51, provides a five-year property tax exemption for newly built fiber optic or coaxial cables and then phases those taxes back in over five years. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Hamilton Republican Sen. Jason Ellsworth, said at the time that providing a tax break for new broadband infrastructure would make it easier for telecom companies to deploy \u201clast mile\u201d internet connections in often-underserved rural areas.\n\nBecause of how Montana\u2019s property tax system divides the cost of running schools, police departments and other local services, tax breaks offered to businesses shift taxes to other property owners, including homeowners.\n\nThe existing tax break requires that companies reinvest the tax savings in additional telecommunications infrastructure. It also specifies that companies can\u2019t claim the tax credit for projects built with funding from the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, the federal pandemic relief measure that has routed more than $300 million to Montana broadband projects.\n\nState officials are also in the process of awarding another $629 million in broadband expansion funding provided by the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) and Digital Equity programs, funded through the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed by former President Joe Biden. There is, however, some concern nationally that the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to rein in federal spending could delay or derail those programs.\n\nrelated What we found in the Legislature\u2019s \u2018junque\u2019 drawer As reporters covering the statehouse, we have a variety of tools we can use as we work to help you, our readers, understand what\u2019s happening at the Capitol. Junque files, particularly when bills are being formed behind the scenes, are a vital part of that toolbox.\n\nWireless industry advocates argued Friday that a state tax credit would complement the federal spending programs by shifting the financial calculations companies make as they weigh whether spending money in rural Montana or elsewhere can deliver them the best investment return.\n\n\u201cThis is not, as we\u2019ve heard, the panacea to deploy wireless throughout the state of Montana. That\u2019s not what this is designed to do,\u201d said AT&T lobbyist Mark Baker. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to be that incremental benefit incentive to building areas where, right now, the [return on investment] doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d",

In February, Verizon introduced some additional savings and benefits for customers who combine wireless service plus home broadband.\n\n\u2013Plan step-ups within its customer base to increase revenues. Boulben said that 45% of Verizon\u2019s customer base is on a premium plan, but there is still room to migrate customers to its \u201csuper-premium\u201d Unlimited Ultimate plan. \u201cWe have still a lot of runway on stepping up the base from entry to premium, from premium to super-premium,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013Continuing C-Band deployments, which result in better churn. Boulben indicated that Verizon continues to see better customer success in markets where it has boosted its network performance and capacity with C-Band spectrum. (Of note: Last year at about this time, Verizon executives on the company\u2019s quarterly call with investors emphasized the differences that they were seeing in markets where Verizon had built out its C-Band coverage, saying that more than 80% of its FWA gross additions in Q1 2024 were in its first 76 C-Band markets and that the carrier sees a higher rate of step-ups to premium service plans in those markets.)\n\n\u2013Use perks to increase customer loyalty. Boulben said that Verizon\u2019s \u201cbest kept secret\u201d is that 15% of its wireless service revenue comes from non-connectivity services such as discounted streaming services and other deals\u2014and those revenues are growing by double-digits. He said that last year by October, Verizon had sold its customers 7 million perks at $10 average per perk. By the end of this year, the company expects to exceed 14 million perks sold to customers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a business in itself, and it generates good margins,\u201d Boulben said.",

            "content": "On Wall Street, most analysts covering the stock are bullish. TMUS stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buy and six Hold ratings over the past three months. TMUS\u2019s average price target of $266.22 per share implies a 1% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nMeanwhile, over 60% of new subscribers are snapping up premium \u201cGo5G\u201d plans, loaded with extras like Netflix, juicing the value of each customer. For context, its 5G Home Internet gambit hooked 428,000 households last quarter, dominating broadband growth for three years straight. All this market hustle helped TMUS churn out a record $17 billion in free cash flow, which management split between hefty share buybacks and network upgrades. Looking ahead, T-Mobile seems to be betting big, aiming for 5.5 to 6 million new customers in 2025 , nearly twice what analysts had previously penciled in. I think that\u2019s quite a gutsy call in a market that\u2019s starting to feel crowded, which forms an incredibly bullish case for T-Mobile.\n\nT-Mobile is wearing the 5G crown like a badge of honor, and it\u2019s not slowing down. The company just had the best year in its history, adding over 3 million postpaid phone customers for the third year in a row\u200b. In the holiday quarter alone, T\u2011Mobile attracted 903,000 postpaid phone net additions, more than its rivals managed, while topping forecasts in the process. The strategy was quite simple\u2013by trusting the playbook that got it here in the first place: aggressive offers and a network that consistently outshines the others. Independent testers at Ookla and OpenSignal now routinely find T\u2011Mobile\u2019s 5G speeds and coverage to be the best nationwide\u200b.\n\nAll in all, one\u2019s a brash upstart tearing up the track, another a legacy name clawing its way back, and the third a seasoned champ tweaking its playbook.\n\nT-Mobile US (TMUS), AT&T (T), and Verizon (VZ) are slugging it out in the 5G arena, each a telecom titan with a unique market offering for U.S. consumers. T-Mobile shares are favored due to strong medium-term financial guidance, with a 7% EBITDA and 8% free cash flow growth projected through 2027. Meanwhile, AT&T shared its shareholder return plans, which include $20 billion in dividends and $20 billion in share buybacks over the next three years. Verizon throws its hat into the ring with its acquisition of Frontier, which is expected to accelerate fiber reach, reduce churn, and improve financial returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) | Fiber Fuels a Quiet Comeback\n\nAT&T is playing a more patient game, stitching 5G wireless and fiber broadband into a mix that\u2019s starting to click. Last quarter, the company snagged 482,000 postpaid phone subscribers, also beating forecasts, driven by dangling discounts for bundling mobile with high-speed home internet. Fiber added 307,000 users, its strongest holiday quarter yet, pushing broadband revenue up 7.7%. CEO John Stankey loves to point out that where AT&T rolls out fiber, it usually wins the customer, and it\u2019s indeed been piling on over a million fiber subscribers per year for seven consecutive years.\n\nRetention is another feather in AT&T\u2019s cap, as it claimed the industry\u2019s lowest churn for the fourth straight year. In a world where everyone\u2019s already got a phone, keeping them happy and willing to spend money on your network counts as much as winning new ones. But this comeback isn\u2019t cheap. Laying fiber and boosting 5G comprised $22 billion in capital spending last year, a hefty price tag for a payoff that\u2019s years out.\n\nIn addition, note that AT&T\u2019s overall growth remains sluggish, stuck in the low single digits, and the stock continues to be ruffled by old scars (remember its costly media detours). Still, AT&T is shedding debt, eyeing modest buybacks in 2025, and even tossing out automatic bill credits for outages to keep folks loyal. The stock\u2019s investment case is certainly not as flashy as TMUS\u2019s, but with plans to hit 50 million fiber locations by 2029, AT&T is building a future-proof network. This slow-and-steady approach might surprise the doubters in a pricing war with shrinking room for new subscriptions.\n\nIs AT&T Stock a Buy or Sell?\n\nWall Street appears somewhat more excited about AT&T, with the stock carrying a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buy and four Hold ratings over the past three months. AT&T\u2019s average price target of $27.79 per share implies just 0.25% upside over the next twelve months, mirroring TMUS\u2019s soft return outlook.\n\nVerizon (NYSE:VZ) | Heavyweight Reinvention\n\nVerizon spent years as the undisputed heavyweight of U.S. wireless, famed for its network quality, above-average margins, and hefty, reliable dividend. Lately, though, the fight has gotten tougher, and Verizon has taken some bruises. The good news? The telecom giant showed it can still throw a punch, adding 568,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the fourth quarter, its best showing in five years. This was driven by holiday iPhone promos and a new \u201cmyPlan\u201d that lets users mix and match perks.\n\nInterestingly, over half its customers have now jumped to these flexible plans, a page from T-Mobile\u2019s book that\u2019s finally paying off. Even its sleepy home broadband business woke up, hitting 4.6 million 5G Home Internet subs and $2.1 billion in fresh revenue. CEO Hans Vestberg\u2019s got his sights on 8\u20139 million by 2028, a leap powered by 5G antennas skipping the trench-digging hassle.\n\nIn the meantime, billions of dollars have sunk into the mid-band C-band spectrum for 5G, balancing the need for speed and coverage to keep its network competitive with T\u2011Mobile\u2019s\u200b. Moreover, enterprise bets, including private networks and an AI Connect platform, hint at new frontiers. Yet, for all the progress, Verizon knows it\u2019s in a dogfight. Winning back subscribers has come at a cost, as those phone promos hit short-term margins, and the company\u2019s 2025 profit outlook is basically flat (0% to 3% growth). So, despite boasting 20 years of consecutive annual dividend increases and now offering a hefty yield of 6.3%, I urge income-oriented investors to always remain alarmed over the possibility of a dividend cut in case Verizon needs to retain more capital for growth.\n\nVerizon (VZ) dividend yield range\n\nIs Verizon Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nWall Street appears relatively optimistic about Verizon as well. The stock has gathered a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buy and 11 Hold ratings over the past three months. Verizon\u2019s average price target of $46.47 per share implies a 5.6% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nThe 5G Sector Niche With Three U.S. Frontrunners\n\nIn this 5G crossroads, each telecom giant is writing a different chapter. T\u2011Mobile is the brash sprinter, grabbing customers and touting a network narrative that has (so far) lived up to the hype. AT&T is the methodical marathon runner, laying fiber groundwork and refining its bundle to keep steady cash flows. Verizon, the seasoned heavyweight, is learning new tricks to stay in the fight, from flexible plans to tapping new tech markets.\n\nOverall, the 5G race is far from over. In fact, the next leg (think 5G Advanced upgrades and even 6G down the road) will demand yet more investment and ingenuity. What\u2019s clear is that guaranteed growth in the space is a thing of the past. Now, it\u2019s about executing smarter and squeezing more value out of each subscriber. The real question is, which path will be the most rewarding in the long run? The answer may be how these strategies play out over the next few pivotal years in the wireless landscape. Nevertheless, picking \u201cthe one\u201d winner proves incredibly tough and highly speculative.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

The motion passed with Trustees Erinn Miller, Markus Zinke, and President Yvonne Wagstaff abstaining due to concerns about student safety and the lack of sufficient data.\n\nDuring the meeting Verizon Wireless presented by Chris Hatch, Yvonne Pinno, and Oku Solutions CEO David Witowski, highlighted the need to address a significant gap in cell service coverage around the East Minden area of highways 395 and 88.\n\nThe item was in response to a suggestion by Douglas County Commissioners that the Douglas High School football stadium might be a feasible alternative for the Verizon cell phone tower site.\n\nThe tower would replace the 58-foot light pole structure currently at the football stadium with an 80-foot pole with the antennas above the lights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not set on that location, but it would be a good spot for the tower,\u201d said Hatch. \u201cThere are a number of planning and sighting issues that we have in Minden and public facilities like the high school and the fire station are preferred by the county. That\u2019s why they pushed these limitations, and why we\u2019re trying to develop these towers at locations that the county supports and that the community supports, so we can bring that coverage to the area.\u201d\n\nTrustees Katherine Dickerson, Susan Jansen, and Burns objected the idea, citing too many unknowns as to how the proximity to the tower could affect the health and safety of students and staff.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is it doesn\u2019t have to be on Douglas High School property,\u201d said Dickerson. \u201cLet\u2019s err to the side of caution here, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d\n\nMiller, Wagstaff, Melinda Gneiting, and Zinke pointed out that cell phone coverage at the high school and the intersection of Highway 88 and 395 is spotty connection and expressed concern about communication disruption between parents and students during emergencies.\n\nDouglas County Commission Chairwoman Sharla Hales told trustees the county is under legal obligation to allow the utility to build a tower, they can\u2019t say no to every place that is presented, and it has to be within a certain radius so the towers will work and provide the correct coverage.\n\n\u201cWhile you can say no, the county cannot,\u201d said Hales. \u201cWe (are) under a legal obligation to allow a tower to be built to provide service and while you can consider health, we cannot consider health. The federal law prevents us from considering health considerations as we make a decision.\u201d\n\nHales suggested the board wait and see what additional information brings forward and agreed with Burn\u2019s suggestion of retrieving expert advice.\n\nOther speakers agreed that more information is necessary from a third party and suggested that having a cell tower at Douglas High School is not part of the core mission of the school.\n\nThe matter goes before Douglas County commissioners on April 3.\n\n\n\n",

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\n5G connectivity from Verizon will be integrated into Honeywell smart meters for improved remote energy management.\n\nThe integration of 5G connectivity into smart meters aims to empower both energy companies and consumers with remote access to crucial data. This will facilitate improved energy consumption and resource management, while also streamlining operations to ease the pressure on the national grid.\n\nTJ Fox, SVP of Industrial IoT and Automotive at Verizon Business, said: \u201cPut simply: secure, reliable connectivity in smart meters makes it easier to monitor the usage of resources and the performance of utility equipment. That means we can reduce waste, unburden our grids, and generally take time and cost out of the utility management process.\n\n\u201cWith massive changes on the horizon for utilities, connected capabilities are going to be critical for managing evolving demands for energy and minimising outages or unforeseen maintenance events.\u201d\n\nThe 5G network from Verizon will enable the seamless transmission of vital information concerning energy consumption, grid conditions, and the operational status of equipment. The data can then be integrated into utility management platforms, such as Honeywell Forge Performance+ for Utilities.\n\nUtility management platforms, used in combination with reliable data over 5G, offer a significantly enhanced level of operational visibility. The near real-time, bottom-up forecasts of energy demand contributes to a more reliable and resilient national grid.\n\nAmol Motivala, President of Honeywell Smart Energy, commented: \u201cBy leveraging the power of AI, cloud, and 5G, we are driving the shift to autonomy for utilities and fundamentally changing the way energy distribution is managed by offering real time connectivity.\n\n\u201cThrough Verizon 5G connectivity, we are reimagining the utility ecosystem with cellular connected smart meters that provide the needed insights to help improve grid performance and customer satisfaction.\u201d\n\nBeyond real-time data access, the Verizon-connected Honeywell smart meters will also support remote upgrades for new functionalities and applications. This capability extends the lifespan of the investment and significantly reduces the need for engineers to visit properties on-site. This remote connectivity also promises to lead to fewer service disruptions and more dependable utility services for consumers.\n\nFurthermore, the smart meters will be compatible with Verizon ThingSpace\u2014an IoT management platform. This will provide energy companies with a unified view of the health and performance of their entire fleet of IoT devices, including the newly connected smart meters.\n\nJohn Marcus, Senior Principal Analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cWith the growth of IoT solutions for utilities, there\u2019s a clear trend toward using cellular-connected intelligence to monitor the grid for operational efficiency, health, resiliency, energy usage, and overall performance.\n\n\u201cThis is especially important as charging infrastructure and energy-management innovations continue to proliferate and are poised for rapid growth. Cellular connectivity, with its inherent security and reliability, is one of the most effective ways to enable the intelligence that can help unburden the grid and more efficiently and intelligently manage energy resources.\u201d\n\nThis collaboration between Honeywell and Verizon is a step forward in leveraging IoT technology to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of energy infrastructure. Integrating 5G into smart meters promises to deliver tangible benefits for both energy providers and consumers and paves the way for a smarter and more resilient energy future.\n\n(Photo by Leon Bredella)\n\nSee also: Onomondo solves IoT scaling with intelligent connectivity\n\nWant to learn about the IoT from industry leaders?

            "content": "T-Mobile US (TMUS), AT&T (T), and Verizon (VZ) are slugging it out in the 5G arena, each a telecom titan with a unique market offering for U.S. consumers. T-Mobile shares are favored due to strong medium-term financial guidance, with a 7% EBITDA and 8% free cash flow growth projected through 2027. Meanwhile, AT&T shared its shareholder return plans, which include $20 billion in dividends and $20 billion in share buybacks over the next three years. Verizon throws its hat into the ring with its acquisition of Frontier, which is expected to accelerate fiber reach, reduce churn, and improve financial returns.\n\nAll in all, one\u2019s a brash upstart tearing up the track, another a legacy name clawing its way back, and the third a seasoned champ tweaking its playbook.\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) | The 5G Trailblazer Charges On\n\nT-Mobile is wearing the 5G crown like a badge of honor, and it\u2019s not slowing down. The company just had the best year in its history, adding over 3 million postpaid phone customers for the third year in a row\u200b. In the holiday quarter alone, T\u2011Mobile attracted 903,000 postpaid phone net additions, more than its rivals managed, while topping forecasts in the process. The strategy was quite simple\u2013by trusting the playbook that got it here in the first place: aggressive offers and a network that consistently outshines the others. Independent testers at Ookla and OpenSignal now routinely find T\u2011Mobile\u2019s 5G speeds and coverage to be the best nationwide\u200b.\n\nMeanwhile, over 60% of new subscribers are snapping up premium \u201cGo5G\u201d plans, loaded with extras like Netflix, juicing the value of each customer. For context, its 5G Home Internet gambit hooked 428,000 households last quarter, dominating broadband growth for three years straight. All this market hustle helped TMUS churn out a record $17 billion in free cash flow, which management split between hefty share buybacks and network upgrades. Looking ahead, T-Mobile seems to be betting big, aiming for 5.5 to 6 million new customers in 2025, nearly twice what analysts had previously penciled in. I think that\u2019s quite a gutsy call in a market that\u2019s starting to feel crowded, which forms an incredibly bullish case for T-Mobile.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for TMUS Stock?\n\nOn Wall Street, most analysts covering the stock are bullish. TMUS stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buy and six Hold ratings over the past three months. TMUS\u2019s average price target of $266.22 per share implies a 1% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) | Fiber Fuels a Quiet Comeback\n\nAT&T is playing a more patient game, stitching 5G wireless and fiber broadband into a mix that\u2019s starting to click. Last quarter, the company snagged 482,000 postpaid phone subscribers, also beating forecasts, driven by dangling discounts for bundling mobile with high-speed home internet. Fiber added 307,000 users, its strongest holiday quarter yet, pushing broadband revenue up 7.7%. CEO John Stankey loves to point out that where AT&T rolls out fiber, it usually wins the customer, and it\u2019s indeed been piling on over a million fiber subscribers per year for seven consecutive years.\n\nRetention is another feather in AT&T\u2019s cap, as it claimed the industry\u2019s lowest churn for the fourth straight year. In a world where everyone\u2019s already got a phone, keeping them happy and willing to spend money on your network counts as much as winning new ones. But this comeback isn\u2019t cheap. Laying fiber and boosting 5G comprised $22 billion in capital spending last year, a hefty price tag for a payoff that\u2019s years out.\n\nIn addition, note that AT&T\u2019s overall growth remains sluggish, stuck in the low single digits, and the stock continues to be ruffled by old scars (remember its costly media detours). Still, AT&T is shedding debt, eyeing modest buybacks in 2025, and even tossing out automatic bill credits for outages to keep folks loyal. The stock\u2019s investment case is certainly not as flashy as TMUS\u2019s, but with plans to hit 50 million fiber locations by 2029, AT&T is building a future-proof network. This slow-and-steady approach might surprise the doubters in a pricing war with shrinking room for new subscriptions.\n\nIs AT&T Stock a Buy or Sell?\n\nWall Street appears somewhat more excited about AT&T, with the stock carrying a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buy and four Hold ratings over the past three months. AT&T\u2019s average price target of $27.79 per share implies just 0.25% upside over the next twelve months, mirroring TMUS\u2019s soft return outlook.\n\nVerizon (NYSE:VZ) | Heavyweight Reinvention\n\nVerizon spent years as the undisputed heavyweight of U.S. wireless, famed for its network quality, above-average margins, and hefty, reliable dividend. Lately, though, the fight has gotten tougher, and Verizon has taken some bruises. The good news? The telecom giant showed it can still throw a punch, adding 568,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the fourth quarter, its best showing in five years. This was driven by holiday iPhone promos and a new \u201cmyPlan\u201d that lets users mix and match perks.\n\nInterestingly, over half its customers have now jumped to these flexible plans, a page from T-Mobile\u2019s book that\u2019s finally paying off. Even its sleepy home broadband business woke up, hitting 4.6 million 5G Home Internet subs and $2.1 billion in fresh revenue. CEO Hans Vestberg\u2019s got his sights on 8\u20139 million by 2028, a leap powered by 5G antennas skipping the trench-digging hassle.\n\nIn the meantime, billions of dollars have sunk into the mid-band C-band spectrum for 5G, balancing the need for speed and coverage to keep its network competitive with T\u2011Mobile\u2019s\u200b. Moreover, enterprise bets, including private networks and an AI Connect platform, hint at new frontiers. Yet, for all the progress, Verizon knows it\u2019s in a dogfight. Winning back subscribers has come at a cost, as those phone promos hit short-term margins, and the company\u2019s 2025 profit outlook is basically flat (0% to 3% growth). So, despite boasting 20 years of consecutive annual dividend increases and now offering a hefty yield of 6.3%, I urge income-oriented investors to always remain alarmed over the possibility of a dividend cut in case Verizon needs to retain more capital for growth.\n\nIs Verizon Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nWall Street appears relatively optimistic about Verizon as well. The stock has gathered a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buy and 11 Hold ratings over the past three months. Verizon\u2019s average price target of $46.47 per share implies a 5.6% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nThe 5G Sector Niche With Three U.S. Frontrunners\n\nIn this 5G crossroads, each telecom giant is writing a different chapter. T\u2011Mobile is the brash sprinter, grabbing customers and touting a network narrative that has (so far) lived up to the hype. AT&T is the methodical marathon runner, laying fiber groundwork and refining its bundle to keep steady cash flows. Verizon, the seasoned heavyweight, is learning new tricks to stay in the fight, from flexible plans to tapping new tech markets.\n\nOverall, the 5G race is far from over. In fact, the next leg (think 5G Advanced upgrades and even 6G down the road) will demand yet more investment and ingenuity. What\u2019s clear is that guaranteed growth in the space is a thing of the past. Now, it\u2019s about executing smarter and squeezing more value out of each subscriber. The real question is, which path will be the most rewarding in the long run? The answer may be how these strategies play out over the next few pivotal years in the wireless landscape. Nevertheless, picking \u201cthe one\u201d winner proves incredibly tough and highly speculative.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

Unlike with previous discounts on the device, no trade-ins are needed to be eligible at all so it's a great all-round choice if you're looking to get a brand-new flagship without handing over an old device.\n\nThe glaring caveat with this deal - and the catch - is that you need that new line on the Ultimate plan. As the name suggests, the Ultimate plan is the priciest and most feature-laden of Verizon's MyPlan postpaid plans. It starts at $90/mo for a single line so it's a significant investment over the required 36-month duration.\n\nIf you can stomach the serious outlay, though, the Ultimate plan is a great choice if you're looking for a postpaid plan with extremely high data speeds.

All rights reserved.)\n\nVerizon\u2019s chief financial officer has raised concerns about a trend in the telecommunications giant\u2019s customers.\n\nAs the cost of living continues to surge worldwide, Verizon's chief financial officer Tony Skiadas revealed that mobile customers in the U.S. are now opting to hold onto their phones for a longer period.\n\nA brand-new phone can cost anywhere between $500 and $1,500, and a recent WalletHub survey showed 63 per cent of Americans would not buy a new cell due to inflation.\n\nAside from the substantial expense, Skiadas said one other reason people were hesitant to upgrade as often is that phones are now \u201cmade better.\u201d\n\n\u201cCustomers continue by choice to hang onto their phones for longer periods of time\u201d, Skiadas told the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference earlier this month. \u201cThe average upgrade cycle for us is just over 40 months, it\u2019s like 42 months right now.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re coming off a couple of years now where there have been declines in uptake. As always, we might see seasonality in that.\u201d\n\nVerizon's chief financial officer Tony Skiadas (Verizon)\n\nNevertheless, Verizon continues to grow its business, earning $27.6 billion in total consumer revenue, a 2.2% increase on the year before, The Street reported. And the CFO told the conference Verizon would \u201ccontinue to be disciplined in our approach to retention\u201d, despite the shift in consumer habits.\n\nWhen pressed on whether they were experiencing a \u201csupercycle\u201d - a period of strong economic growth with typically strong demand for commodities - he replied \u201cno\u201d.\n\nThe latest data from the Social Security Administration, as of 2023, suggest that the average salary in the U.S. is $66,622. Unlike many cost-of-living expenses, new cellphones cost the same nationwide.\n\nWallethub analyst Chip Lupo said: \u201cThis year, consumers are holding off on upgrading their phones, as 63% of people say they won\u2019t buy a new phone due to inflation. When day-to-day living costs are already high, it\u2019s hard for many people to justify an expensive phone upgrade.\n\n\u201cIn fact, nine in 10 Americans think iPhones are overpriced, so Apple and other phone companies may need to consider lowering prices or offering more substantial feature differences between models to entice customers.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Most Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against other most undervalued dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStock prices took a steep hit in March as investors grew concerned about a possible economic downturn, driven by unpredictable tariff policies and signs of slowing job growth. The broader market has dropped over 7% from its peak on February 19, putting stocks on the doorstep of a correction.\n\nA group of seasoned investors saw last week\u2019s stock market downturn as a buying opportunity. As the market briefly entered correction territory, wiping out approximately $5 trillion from the broader market\u2019s value, corporate insiders began increasing their purchases. According to data from the Washington Service, the insider sentiment index climbed to 0.46 in March, up from 0.31 in January, with almost two weeks still remaining in the month. This puts the metric on track for its highest monthly level since June, bringing it closer to its historical norm.\n\nDave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments, made the following comment about the situation:\n\n\u201cIf we see corporate insiders begin to use the opportunity in their stock prices to purchase shares, that shows that they have confidence in the underlying economy and in their underlying businesses. That differs from just the headlines, because the headlines are scary.\u201d\n\nIn its 2025 US Market Outlook, Morningstar indicated that the US stock market was approaching the upper limit of its fair value range, suggesting that investors should moderate their return expectations for the year. It was noted that, since the end of 2010, the market had traded at such a premium or higher less than 10% of the time. Given these conditions, the firm had adopted a more cautious stance, emphasizing the increasing importance of portfolio positioning.\n\nMorningstar advised investors to overweight value stocks and underweight growth stocks, citing that growth stocks were trading at their highest premium relative to fair value since the tech-driven bubble in early 2021, whereas value stocks remained undervalued. As of March 3, 2025, the Morningstar Value Index had gained 5.54% year to date, while the Morningstar Growth Index had declined 3.81%.\n\nIn addition, investors are shifting capital into value funds, which are perceived as more resilient during market downturns compared to growth stocks. Data from Lipper shows that U.S. growth exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $3.6 billion in outflows this month, while U.S. value ETFs attracted $1.8 billion in inflows. Value funds, which are largely composed of stocks from sectors like banking, energy, and utilities, provide a cushion against market volatility by focusing on stable, cash-rich, and undervalued companies that tend to be less sensitive to economic swings.\n\nChris Marangi, co-chief investment officer of value funds at Gabelli Funds, noted that value stocks present an appealing opportunity, especially among small and mid-cap companies. He highlighted that these firms tend to gain more from deregulation and tax cuts while being less impacted by challenges like tariffs. Given this, we will take a look at the most undervalued stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 20. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected seven companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 20: 9.40\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company. Earlier this month, the company\u2019s management cautioned that first-quarter performance might fall short of expectations. The company acknowledged that heightened competition and broader economic uncertainties in the US were impacting its results. While Verizon scaled back on promotions at the beginning of the year, rival telecom providers continued their aggressive offers, making its plans appear less competitive in comparison. That said, investors and analysts are hopeful for the company\u2019s future. The stock has surged by nearly 9% since the start of 2025.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) delivered solid fourth-quarter results for 2024, reporting $35.7 billion in revenue, a 1.6% increase from the previous year. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in customer acquisitions across both mobile wireless and internet services. In the mobile wireless segment, net postpaid phone subscriber additions rose to 568,000, up from 449,000 in the prior year. Revenue from this segment climbed 3.1% year-over-year to $20 billion, marking its 18th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) continues to appeal to investors due to its strong cash flow and focus on innovation. In fiscal 2024, the company generated $37 billion in operating cash flow, while free cash flow increased to $19.8 billion from $18.7 billion in the previous year. The company\u2019s quarterly dividend comes in at $0.6775 per share for a dividend yield of 6.19%, as of March 20. In addition to its attractive dividend yield, the company also maintains an 18-year streak of dividend growth.\n\nOverall, VZ ranks 7th on our list of most undervalued dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

The SoftBank Maruyama Landing Station serves as a landing point for numerous submarine cables, including the trans-Pacific optical submarine cable \u201cJUPITER,\u201d which began operations in August 2020, and the \u201cADC,\u201d which commenced operations in December 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea\u2019s SK Broadband is part of the wider SK Group that also has a data center business that is spearheaded by the group company SK Telecom. Readers would recall that just a few weeks ago, SK Telecom had unveiled ambitious plans surrounding the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) including building an AI Infra Super Highway. The company is also planning a data center that will house 60,000 Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) with a power consumption capacity of 100 MW. But the company aims to expand the facility\u2019s capacity to 1-2 GW in future, making it one of the biggest data centers in South Korea. Investments into connectivity infrastructure fall in line with these ambitions.",

The mobile carrier said Thursday that it's expanding satellite texting at no cost to users with Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 smartphones.\n\nThe upgrade is being rolling out immediately and will continue over the next two weeks, Verizon said in a statement.\n\nThe previously announced move means you can send and receive texts on any network or device via satellite even when off the grid. This system differs from the satellite SOS tools used on iPhones and Pixel devices. Although these phones have been able to send emergency messages over satellites for a while now, Android phones have lagged behind.\n\nThe move follows Verizon's efforts to test data services and video calling via satellite connectivity, similar to AT&T's initiatives. The company already relies on satellite technology for emergency response. It also marks a broader trend among technology companies moving beyond emergency SOS. With Apple integrating T-Mobile's Starlink service into iPhones, staying connected off the grid could be significantly easier by cutting down on chasing signal bars or angling your phone toward the sky in spotty coverage areas.\n\nAs Starlink, Amazon's Project Kuiper and others race to expand coverage \u2014 including T-Mobile testing Starlink access for AT&T and Verizon customers \u2014 it's possible we're inching closer to a world where your phone works anywhere. For a deeper dive on how Verizon's new service works, check out our CNET demo of Samsung's Galaxy S25's satellite texting for Verizon customers.\n\n'Just the beginning\"\n\nJosep Jornet, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, said the next big tech race among companies is satellite-based mobile connectivity.\n\n\"It is a race, and this is just the beginning,\" he said. \"First SMS, then calls and ultimately high-speed data.\"\n\nCompanies are expected to eventually push into higher-frequency bands such as millimeter waves and sub-THz, unlocking even faster and more reliable global connectivity, Jornet said.",

If you own a Google Pixel 9 or Samsung Galaxy S25 series phone and find yourself in a cellular dead zone, you can now send texts to your friends and family via satellite. This is the same functionality Apple introduced for the iPhone 14 and newer (regardless of carrier) in iOS 18.\n\nWhile these Android phones have been able to connect to emergency services via satellite, they can now use satellite connectivity to send texts to anyone, regardless of the recipient's device or carrier. Verizon says this capability has already started to roll out but will take two weeks to complete.\n\nVerizon isn't the only carrier focused on providing this kind of satellite connectivity to fill in the gaps in terrestrial cellular network coverage. T-Mobile recently announced a partnership with Starlink that's currently in beta until July. It lets you send and receive texts, and the carrier says you'll soon be able to share photos, use data, make voice calls, and more. T-Mobile's solution will be included for subscribers on its Go5G Next plan, and other customers can add it to their existing plan for $15 per month. AT&T is also working with AST SpaceMobile and recently tested a video call over satellite connectivity.\n\nThis Handheld Console Lets You Relive Your Nintendo DS Dreams\n\nCourtesy of OneXSugar\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the Steam Deck, you\u2019ve seen the Switch, and you no doubt remember the Nintendo DS. But this newly announced gaming handheld, the OneXSugar, claims to do that all in one. The device has two screens and rotating gamepad controllers to allow it to transform into all sorts of clever modes of use. There\u2019s the standard landscape mode, using the primary 6-inch screen and the two sides of the controller. But flip up that screen and you\u2019ll get access to the 3.92-inch secondary square screen. That secondary screen can be used as a kickstand, or you can rotate the controllers to attach to the square screen. Now that\u2019s definitely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nThe Android-based device, announced on Indiegogo, was unveiled alongside a new series of chips from Qualcomm designed specifically for gaming handhelds. The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 boasts 28 percent improved graphics with ray tracing, specifically designed for cloud-based gaming and retro emulators. Just don\u2019t expect it to support Windows-level games like AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z-series chips, which you can find in handhelds like the popular Asus ROG Ally X.\n\nThe company behind the OneXSugar also has something more powerful in its lineup, the OneXPlayer G1, which is part laptop, part gaming handheld. No word on the price or release date yet, but hopefully we\u2019ll hear more details about the OneXSugar soon. \u2014Luke Larsen\n\nVelotric's Breeze 1 Is a Commuting, Crusing Ebike\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nAfter multiple rounds of layoffs and pulling out of the European market, Rad Power Bikes\u2019 new CEO recently stepped down. That leaves a big, Rad-sized hole in the direct-to-consumer electric bike space\u2014a space the company created when Mike Radenbaugh founded Rad in 2007.\n\nWhich company will fill in the gap? We\u2019re most excited to test one of the new bikes from the up-and-coming Velotric. The Breeze 1 launched on March 18. It's a commuter bike built like a cruiser, with a comfortable, upright seating position on a step-through frame and a powerful 750-watt motor with a 70-mile range.\n\nThe bike also has a few cool tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can switch between using a torque sensor, which will adjust the pressure you need to pedal on mixed terrain, versus the more old-fashioned cadence sensor, which is best for longer stretches of roads. It\u2019s also integrated with Apple Find My and Apple Health, so if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you don\u2019t have to fiddle with your fitness tracker to log a bike ride. Most importantly, it weighs under 50 pounds and costs under $2,000. I\u2019m unboxing my tester ride (in Violet Haze, naturally) as we speak. \u2014Adrienne So\n\nFujifilm Debuts a Medium Format Compact Camera\n\nAnyone who\u2019s ever dreamed of a medium format Fujifilm X100 camera, dream no more. The new GFX100RF is just that. It takes the same minimalist, rangefinder styling of the X100 series, with dial controls and a nice wide-angle prime lens on the front, but adds a 102-megapixel medium format sensor.\n\nThere is a price to be paid for that much larger sensor though\u2014the GFX100RF is larger and heavier than any of the X100 cameras. At 5.26 by 3.56 inches, with a depth of 3 inches, this isn\u2019t fitting in your pocket, nor is the 25.9 ounces (735 grams) light enough to let you throw it in your bag and forget about it. To make the GFX100RF weather-sealed you\u2019ll need to further bulk it up with an adapter ring and filter, just as you do with the X100VI.",

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said none of the fired employees were air traffic controllers or critical for aviation safety.\n\nA DOGE team of SpaceX engineers acting as special government employees visited FAA facilities last week.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson)",

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\nSatellite texting is not just for emergencies anymore.\n\nIf you're a Verizon customer, you can now send text messages via satellite to any device, regardless of carrier, when cell service is unavailable. The mobile carrier said Thursday that it's expanding satellite texting at no cost to users with Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 smartphones.\n\nThe upgrade is being rolling out immediately and will continue over the next two weeks, Verizon said in a statement.\n\nThe previously announced move means you can send and receive texts on any network or device via satellite even when off the grid. This system differs from the satellite SOS tools used on iPhones and Pixel devices. Although these phones have been able to send emergency messages over satellites for a while now, Android phones have lagged behind.\n\nThe move follows Verizon's efforts to test data services and video calling via satellite connectivity, similar to AT&T's initiatives. The company already relies on satellite technology for emergency response. It also marks a broader trend among technology companies moving beyond emergency SOS. With Apple integrating T-Mobile's Starlink service into iPhones, staying connected off the grid could be significantly easier by cutting down on chasing signal bars or angling your phone toward the sky in spotty coverage areas.\n\nAs Starlink, Amazon's Project Kuiper and others race to expand coverage \u2014 including T-Mobile testing Starlink access for AT&T and Verizon customers \u2014 it's possible we're inching closer to a world where your phone works anywhere. For a deeper dive on how Verizon's new service works, check out our CNET demo of Samsung's Galaxy S25's satellite texting for Verizon customers.\n\n'Just the beginning\"\n\nJosep Jornet, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, said the next big tech race among companies is satellite-based mobile connectivity.\n\n\"It is a race, and this is just the beginning,\" he said. \"First SMS, then calls and ultimately high-speed data.\"\n\nCompanies are expected to eventually push into higher-frequency bands such as millimeter waves and sub-THz, unlocking even faster and more reliable global connectivity, Jornet said.",

The American people can't wait 10 years or 12 years to lay fiber.\"\n\nVerizon said in response it is working with the FAA on solutions to create an advanced, safer national air traffic control.\n\n\"We are open and willing to work with companies that may offer complementary services to this new communications network,\" Verizon said, adding it is \"actively working with the FAA's technology teams and our solutions stand ready to be deployed.\"\n\nDuffy said companies need to move fast to address aging systems. \"It's not going to be one company. We're going to need a lot of companies to buy in and help build up the system,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Musk's SpaceX said its Starlink satellite unit has no intent to take over any FAA telecommunications contract, rejecting media reports. Reuters has reported the FAA is reviewing the Verizon contract.\n\n\"Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to 'take over' any existing contract,\" SpaceX posted on X, the social media platform also owned by Musk.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office says the FAA must take urgent action to address aging air traffic control systems, saying that one third are unsustainable.\n\nMany Democrats have suggested the FAA could cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and give it to Starlink because of Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump. Musk, who is leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency federal cost-cutting operation, has criticized the current FAA telecom system.\n\nLast month, the FAA said it was testing three Starlink terminals at a government facility in Alaska to restore stable access to weather information for pilots and the FAA.\n\n(Reporting by David ShepardsonEditing by Bill Berkrot)",

Well, those days might be numbered as satellite messaging becomes the next big thing in telecommunications.\n\nHistorically, satellite communication has been reserved for specialized uses or emergencies. However, Verizon, one of the largest telecom companies in the U.S., recently announced the launch of its non-emergency satellite texting service.\n\nThis comes less than a month after AT&T and Verizon successfully completed the first satellite-based video call in partnership with AST SpaceMobile, a space-based cellular broadband network.\n\nNow, Verizon's satellite messaging service allows users to send texts to anyone using their Google Pixel 9 series device or Samsung Galaxy S25 series smartphone\u2014sorry, iPhone 16 users. Using this, customers can connect to satellites when they're outside the reach of traditional cellular networks, making it the first in the U.S. to offer this capability for everyday use.\n\nThe service upgrades are already rolling out and will continue over the next two weeks. Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series users on Verizon should receive a software update to enable this feature. So, if you have one of these devices, keep an eye out for updates in the coming days.\n\nVerizon isn't alone in this satellite messaging revolution. Just one day after Verizon's announcement, Comcast and Charter (through their mobile services Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile) jumped on the bandwagon.\n\nFor now, they're offering satellite-based emergency messaging for Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 owners as well, powered by the same non-terrestrial network service provider Skylo that worked with Google on the Pixel 9's Satellite SOS feature. But, in the coming weeks, Comcast's Xfinity Mobile and Charter's Spectrum Mobile plan to let users send and receive regular SMS text messages over satellite.\n\nThis move doesn't just represent a significant expansion of satellite communication capabilities beyond emergencies; it's part of a broader trend in which major telecom companies invest in satellite technology to provide more reliable coverage in areas with poor cellular service.\n\nLast year, T-Mobile partnered with Starlink, a satellite-based internet service provider, to offer direct-to-cell satellite services.",

            "content": "Verizon is making some changes to its Disney+ Premium perk for myPlan (cellular) and myHome (broadband) subscribers.\n\nThe current Disney+ Premium bundle, which includes Disney+ (ad-free), Hulu (with ads), and ESPN+ (with ads), is no longer available for $10 per month. Existing customers can keep the bundle, but they\u2019ll be charged $15 per month starting April 17. For new customers, though, the revised pricing is effective immediately.\n\nIt's not all bad though, since the carrier is now offering a similar ad-supported Disney+ bundle featuring the same three streaming services. Both new and existing customers can get this perk for the same $10 a month. The only effective difference from the previous plan is that Disney+ now comes with ads.\n\nVerizon notified customers of the price change and the new ad-supported tier via email, adding that \u201cif you are on a trial or promotional rate right now, you\u2019ll still get to enjoy that special price. The new rate will take effect after your offer has ended.\u201d These details have also been added to the FAQ section of Verizon\u2019s support page for Disney+ add-ons.\n\nDespite the price hike, Verizon\u2019s continues to offer significant discounts with its perks. While the regular Disney+ Legacy subscription, which includes Disney+ (ad-free), Hulu (with ads), and ESPN+ (with ads), costs $21.99 per month, Verizon\u2019s version is $7 cheaper. Similarly, the Basic ad-supported bundle typically costs $16.99 per month, but it\u2019s $7 less when it's bundled with a Verizon plan.\n\nVerizon has been steadily jacking up prices for various add-ons. The carrier also upped the monthly fee of its Mobile Protect Multi-Device plan (4-20 lines) by $8 last month. And last December, it increased its monthly administrative fee.",

            "content": "Verizon customers can now send text messages via satellite to any device, regardless of carrier, when cell service is unavailable. The company announced Thursday that it is expanding its satellite texting capabilities at no cost to users with Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 smartphones. The upgrade begins rolling out immediately and will continue over the next two weeks, Verizon said in a press release.\n\nThe previously announced move enables users to send and receive texts on any network or device via satellite even when off the grid. This system differs from the satellite SOS tools used on iPhones and Pixel devices. Although these phones have been able to send emergency messages over satellites for a while now, Android phones have lagged behind.\n\nThe move follows Verizon's efforts to test data services and video calling via satellite connectivity, similar to AT&T's initiatives. The company already relies on satellite technology for emergency response. It also marks a broader trend among technology companies moving beyond emergency SOS. With Apple integrating T-Mobile's Starlink service into iPhones, staying connected off the grid could be significantly easier by cutting down on chasing signal bars or angling your phone toward the sky in spotty coverage areas.\n\nAs Starlink, Amazon's Project Kuiper and others race to expand coverage \u2014 including T-Mobile testing Starlink access for AT&T and Verizon customers \u2014 it's possible we're inching closer to a world where your phone works anywhere. For a deeper dive on how Verizon's new service works, check out our CNET demo of Samsung's Galaxy S25's satellite texting for Verizon customers.\n\nThe Start of Something Bigger\n\nJosep Jornet, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, said the next big tech race among companies is satellite-based mobile connectivity.\n\n\"It is a race, and this is just the beginning,\" he said. \"First, SMS, then calls, and ultimately high-speed data.\"\n\nCompanies are expected to eventually push into higher-frequency bands such as millimeter waves and sub-THz, unlocking even faster and more reliable global connectivity, Jornet said.",

            "content": "The two carriers quibbled over T-Mobile\u2019s messaging around its up-and-coming satellite services\n\nT-Mobile won that round, but Verizon's not backing down\n\nVerizon wants everyone to know it\u2019s dead serious about satellite connectivity, announcing a first of its own this week\n\nVerizon and T-Mobile are at it again, and this time, it\u2019s more about what\u2019s above their terrestrial networks than what\u2019s on the ground.\n\nTo be sure, these two have been at each other\u2019s throats for years, primarily because Verizon made a reputation for itself as the carrier with the \u201cbest network\u201d and T-Mobile, long known as a network laggard, set its sights on upending that. Lo and behold, 5G arrived and T-Mobile seized the moment to leapfrog its competitors, claim the 5G network crown and rub it in with endless third-party analyses.\n\nThey both compete aggressively against AT&T, too, but the jabs between T-Mobile and Verizon are especially sharp. Now they\u2019re increasingly ratcheting up the rhetoric when it comes to who offers what and when in terms of satellite-enabled services. It\u2019s getting downright, dare we say, petty?\n\nTo wit: The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the BBB National Programs early Wednesday put out a press release announcing its decision to back T-Mobile\u2019s claim that it\u2019s the first and only wireless provider to partner with Starlink, the satellite service owned by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nThe TL;DR version? NAD\u2019s decision was made in response to a complaint filed by Verizon, which argued that T-Mobile\u2019s online advertising conveys the message that T-Mobile is the \u201cfirst and only\u201d carrier to offer satellite-enabled messaging services on select devices, but it\u2019s misleading because other carriers offer satellite-enabled messaging services. Verizon further argued that T-Mobile\u2019s advertising is misleading because its satellite-enabled messaging services are in beta and not widely available to consumers.\n\nT-Mobile responded that consumers understand that its ads are related to T-Mobile\u2019s partnership with Starlink and aren\u2019t misleading; they\u2019re actually valid because T-Mobile is the first and only U.S. wireless provider to partner with Starlink on direct-to-device (D2D) communications via satellite.\n\nIn the end, NAD sided with T-Mobile, pointing to a Hal Poret survey that T-Mobile had submitted as part of its defense showing consumers don\u2019t think T-Mobile is claiming to be the \u201cfirst or only\u201d provider to offer any type of satellite coverage, as Verizon contended. Rather, consumers understand that T-Mobile is only claiming it\u2019s the first and only U.S. wireless provider hooking up with Starlink to expand mobile coverage.\n\nVerizon's not done here\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. Less than an hour after the NAD decision went out, Verizon put out a press release announcing a \u201csignificant expansion\u201d of its satellite texting capabilities, enabling its customers to become \u201cthe first in the U.S. to send text messages to any other customer device via satellite when outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks using select Android devices from the series of Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 smartphones.\u201d\n\nBasically, it means that now all Android customers with compatible devices on Verizon\u2019s network can text anyone while using satellite links instead of just reaching out for emergency services, according to a Verizon spokesperson. The service is free to Verizon customers who have qualifying devices and it\u2019s enabled through Verizon\u2019s partnership with Skylo.\n\nSo, T-Mobile apparently wins the argument about being first with a Starlink-based service. Verizon prevails in the texting race with select Android smartphones. And hey, while we know nit-picky details are super-duper important (what do you think we\u2019ve been doing these last several decades?), we\u2019re not at all sure where this is all going.\n\nThat\u2019s why we asked TMF Associates analyst Tim Farrar for his take on all this.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all splitting hairs with these claims,\u201d he said, reminding us that handset maker and marketer extraordinaire Apple was actually the first to offer a satellite service, powered by Globalstar, that allows regular SMS in addition to iMessage. There may be some constraints \u2013 Apple mentions that \u201cnot all carriers support SMS messaging via satellite, and some features may vary\u201d on its support page, but it\u2019s certainly a first.\n\nWhat's EchoStar up to?\n\nFarrar offered another explanation for the recent hoopla from the operators, which is the expectation of a forthcoming announcement from EchoStar. \u201cPart of the motivation from both Verizon and T-Mobile may be to try and get ahead of that,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, speculation was high at the Satellite 2025 conference in Washington, D.C., last week around EchoStar potentially contracting for a low Earth orbit (LEO) direct-to-device (D2D) constellation from satellite manufacturer MDA Space. Such a service could provide broadband connectivity, a topic EchoStar President and CEO Hamid Akhavan talked about during the company\u2019s Q4 conference call.\n\nSo far, we haven\u2019t seen any news from EchoStar on this front, leaving us to read the tea leaves. The presumption is EchoStar would need a strategic partner to provide billions of dollars to fund a significant D2D project and Farrar said it\u2019s hard to think of any possibilities for an EchoStar partner other than Apple.\n\nYet true to form, EchoStar Chairman Charlie Ergen is keeping his cards close to the vest and given his track record as a poker player, it\u2019s entirely possible that it could just all be an enormous bluff, Farrar noted. Either way, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for whatever\u2019s in the cards.",

            "content": "Verizon and Openbank announced a partnership on Tuesday that gives Verizon customers a way to save money on their bill if they have an Openbank High Yield Savings account.\n\nVerizon customers can save money on their monthly bill for 12 months and also access a competitive annual percentage yield (APY) by opening an Openbank High Yield Savings account. Openbank, a division of Santander Bank, currently offers the second-highest yield (4.4 percent annual percentage yield) among Bankrate\u2019s best high-yield savings accounts.\n\nThe exact amount of savings on your Verizon bill will be either $5, $10 or $15 per month, depending on your average savings account balance. So that could save a Verizon customer between $60 and $180 over the 12-month period.\n\n\u201cBy partnering with Verizon, the nation\u2019s leading mobile provider, Openbank can offer a differentiated savings opportunity and digital experience to millions of consumers across the U.S.,\u201d says Ana Bot\u00edn, Banco Santander executive chair.\n\nHow the partnership works\n\nYou\u2019ll need at least $500 to open an Openbank High Yield Savings account, and have an average daily balance of at least $1,000 in your account to save money on your Verizon bill.\n\nVerizon customers who meet the Openbank balance requirements save the following for 12 months:\n\n$5 per month with an average daily balance of at least $1,000\n\n$10 per month with an average daily balance of at least $10,000\n\n$15 per month with an average daily balance of at least $30,000\n\nCurrently, people who live in some East Coast states can\u2019t open this account (though it may be available soon in those states, according to Openbank\u2019s website). Also, Santander Bank branches are not able to assist Openbank customers.\n\nVerizon customers will need to have a residential address in one of the eligible states, be a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien and be at least 18 years old for this offer. They also need to have a U.S. cell phone number and a tablet or mobile phone to download the bank\u2019s app \u2013 and they can\u2019t have more than 12 phone lines on their Verizon account, depending on their plan, according to Verizon. In addition to cellular customers, LTE Home Internet and 5G Home Internet customers are eligible for this offer.\n\nVerizon isn\u2019t the first cell phone company to be linked to a high-yielding account. T-Mobile has its T-Mobile MONEY account, an account provided by Customers Bank.\n\nWhat to keep in mind\n\nOpenbank made its debut as a division of Santander in October 2024. Like many other brick-and-mortar banks that have an online division, your balances at both of these banks are combined to determine Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insurance coverage. So if you already had $200,000 in an individual savings account at Santander Bank, and you deposited $100,000 into an Openbank individual savings account, $50,000 of your balance wouldn\u2019t be FDIC insured.\n\nAlso, like most savings accounts, Openbank\u2019s yield is variable \u2013 so it can change at any time.\n\nSince Openbank is a newer bank, you want to keep an eye on your APY to make sure it stays competitive. But that\u2019s also the case with any account with a variable APY.\n\nOpenbank customers won\u2019t be able to access their money at an ATM and they won\u2019t be able to have their account serviced at a Santander branch. This isn\u2019t unusual though. There are other online banks that don\u2019t have ATM access and, generally, online banks don\u2019t have branch access.\n\nHow does this deal compare to top savings accounts?\n\nOpenbank\u2019s High Yield Savings account offers one of the top savings yields, which is more than seven times higher than the national average. The Verizon bill credit makes it an account Verizon customers might want to consider \u2013 assuming that Openbank\u2019s APY stays competitive in the future.",

Verizon started offering this service for emergency situations and location sharing, but now it's coming to any text message.\n\nOne caveat with satellite texting is that you must be completely out of cell range for the satellite option to kick in. If you have a minimal signal that makes texting slow or difficult, your phone will keep trying to send the text the traditional way.\n\nThe company is also working on satellite-based calling that would let you make a call without a cell signal. However, this isn't expected to be available until later this year or even next year.\n\nAlso: The best satellite phones of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nVerizon stated earlier that there won't be any additional charge for satellite texting.

According to Verizon, its U.S.-based customers will be the first in the nation to receive such support. The company states users can \"send text messages to any other customer device via satellite when outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks.\"\n\nThere is some restriction here as Verizon states this satellite capability won't hit every Android phone. Users with a Samsung Galaxy S25 or Google Pixel 9 series phone can leverage its newly expanded satellite texting.\n\nVerizon is starting to hammer away at these upgrades today (Mar. 19); however, it will likely take two weeks before it's completely stable and ready.\n\nVerizon's EVP & president, Global Network and Technology, Joe Russo, said in a statement, \"This expansion of satellite texting capabilities is a testament to our commitment to ensure customers stay connected wherever they are.\"\n\n(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)\n\nCuriously, it's unclear whether or not this satellite texting capability includes the recent Google Pixel 9a. There is no information from Verizon nor Google on this matter. Android Central has reached out to Google about this matter and will update this article when we hear back.\n\nThe Pixel 9a launched today (Mar. 19) with a fresh new look that forgoes that thick camera bump we've become accustomed to. The phone features a battery life of up to 30 hours and rapid charging support. For $499, the Pixel 9a contains Google's latest AI features like Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, and more.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn other news, Google mentioned briefly about the Pixel 9 series joining Verizon's satellite messaging services during its March feature drop. It seems things are finally in a spot where both sides can move forward and begin bringing it to consumers. Additionally, Verizon highlights its work to expand and improve the usefulness of satellite communications \u2014 such as its usage for satellite-based video calls.\n\nIn late February, Verizon joined AT&T in testing the first satellite-to-phone video calls using the BlueBird satellite from AST SpaceMobile. Verizon announced the test saw it placing its first-ever satellite call through this method. AST SpaceMobile said it was rolling out an on-demand direct-to-device service in the U.S. This is said to leverage Verizon and AT&T's 850MHz spectrum due to its close relation with smartphones.\n\nThere appears to be some optimism regarding satellite-based video calls; however, more testing is still required before civilians can partake.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of What Did Jim Cramer Say About These 19 Stocks Recently? In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently.\n\nJim Cramer kicked off his latest episode of Mad Money by highlighting the wild swings in the market, the ongoing trade war with Canada, and the growing concerns about tariffs and inflation. Although tech stocks attempted a rally, it fizzled out by the close. Cramer described the volatile trading session by saying:\n\n\u201cWe got a good sign. The beat-down tech stocks rallied and rallied hard at one point after a lot of time lost in the wilderness while the recession proof stocks, well, they finally got clubbed.\u201d\n\nJim Cramer then explained that the reason behind this volatility is the escalating trade war with Canada. Here\u2019s how he explained the situation:\n\n\u201cWe got a trade war going with Canada. Here\u2019s what happened, they announced a 25% tariff on electricity in our country earlier today. Immediately president Trump announced some hard retaliation doubling the tariffs on aluminum and steel. The steel side can be dealt with. Aluminum, I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s bad news. Canadians produce a huge percentage of that stuff for our airline makers, for trucks, for cars. A 50% tariff would be very inflationary and could destroy the profits of the automakers.\u201d\n\nCramer then shifted his focus to the broader implications of the White House\u2019s stance on the stock market. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s talk about stock prices in the White House. Now this weekend, the President said he\u2019s not focused on the stock market. Maybe if you\u2019re in power and you\u2019re not up for re-election, the stock market could be ignored. That\u2019s just one problem. This is what the President\u2019s forgetting: the stock market serves a dual role. Yes, it makes rich people richer, no doubt\u2014at least when it\u2019s going up. But when it goes down, it can also be a signal; a signal that things aren\u2019t well in the economy, that business could be getting tougher, and that layoffs could be on the table.\u201d\n\nWhile Cramer agreed with the broader goal of addressing trade imbalances, he criticized the way the administration is handling it, which is causing widespread uncertainty. Here\u2019s how he put it:\n\n\u201cBecause of the President\u2019s tumultuous approach to trade, these tariffs are beginning to scare people\u2014regular people, you, me\u2014and that\u2019s what the stock market has been saying before the Canadians blinked and we momentarily avoid a real trade war. But we\u2019re still seeing a pronounced decline in small business optimism. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9. Small businesses are the backbone of the economy. Big businesses are always trying to trim costs, small businesses hire. We\u2019re starting to see large shortfalls in many different industries.\u201d\n\nFinally, Cramer\u2019s opinion is that the U.S. is no longer a manufacturing-driven economy, but a service-driven one, where businesses thrive on stability and consumer confidence. Here\u2019s how he explained it:\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re not a manufacturing economy, we\u2019re a service economy. That\u2019s why it stings when you see these retailers, telecoms, and airlines linking the negativity of their customers to political actions. [\u2026] The issue is that, again, we\u2019re service. Most of our business is service, and that economy is starting to roll over because consumer confidence is declining as people worry about the impact of these tariffs. They don\u2019t understand them. Sure, we have plenty of room for layoffs, so to speak, because we have very low unemployment. But the stock market is saying the tariffs will be inflationary, and the White House hasn\u2019t explained to the American people why it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 19 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 11th. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nJim Cramer mentioned that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) had a rough trading session, raising concerns about the state of the telecom sector. Cramer didn\u2019t mince words about the stock\u2019s decline, saying:\n\n\u201cWe got a real ugly read about the state of telecommunications today from Verizon, the stock fell 6.5%, 3 points, wow.\u201d\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a leading telecommunications giant that has been expanding its footprint in AI-driven infrastructure through its \u201cAI Connect\u201d initiative. This program positions Verizon to capitalize on the growing demand for AI infrastructure, leveraging its fiber network and edge computing capabilities to support businesses deploying AI workloads. With a $1 billion deal pipeline and major partnerships with Google and Meta, the company is making strategic moves in a space expected to attract over $1 trillion in investments over the next decade.\n\nOverall, VZ ranks 16th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

The American people can't wait 10 years or 12 years to lay fiber.\"\n\nVerizon said in response it is working with the FAA on solutions to create an advanced, safer national air traffic control.\n\n\"We are open and willing to work with companies that may offer complementary services to this new communications network,\" Verizon said, adding it is \"actively working with the FAA's technology teams and our solutions stand ready to be deployed.\"\n\nDuffy said companies need to move fast to address aging systems. \"It's not going to be one company. We're going to need a lot of companies to buy in and help build up the system,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Musk's SpaceX said its Starlink satellite unit has no intent to take over any FAA telecommunications contract, rejecting media reports. Reuters has reported the FAA is reviewing the Verizon contract.\n\n\"Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to 'take over' any existing contract,\" SpaceX posted on X, the social media platform also owned by Musk.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office says the FAA must take urgent action to address aging air traffic control systems, saying that one third are unsustainable.\n\nMany Democrats have suggested the FAA could cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and give it to Starlink because of Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump. Musk, who is leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency federal cost-cutting operation, has criticized the current FAA telecom system.\n\nLast month, the FAA said it was testing three Starlink terminals at a government facility in Alaska to restore stable access to weather information for pilots and the FAA.\n\n(Reporting by David ShepardsonEditing by Bill Berkrot)",

Then, select your preferred color and storage capacity and decide if you'll trade in an older iPhone, which could get you up to $630 back from Apple.\n\nThen, choose an optional carrier and AppleCare Plus coverage (or not) and click the blue Add to Bag button. You can then add any accessories you want and enter your payment information to complete your purchase.\n\nHow much does the iPhone 16 cost and what are the specs?\n\nPrices differ depending on the amount of storage you buy, but here's the range:\n\niPhone 16E: $599 to $899\n\niPhone 16: $799 to $1,099\n\niPhone 16 Plus: $899 to $1,199\n\niPhone 16 Pro: $999 to $1,499\n\niPhone 16 Pro Max: $1,199 to $1,599\n\nRead more: All-New iPhone 16 Button Adds Camera Control to Apple's Flagship Phone\n\niPhone 16 lineup specs\n\niPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max Starting price 128GB $799 $899 $999 N/A Starting price 256GB $899 $999 $1,099 $1,199 Starting price 512GB $1,099 $1,199 $1,299 $1,399 Starting price 1TB N/A N/A $1,499 $1,599 Display size 6.1-inch 6.7-inch 6.3-inch 6.9-inch Screen resolution (pixels) 2,556 x 1,179 2,796 x 1,290 2,622 x 1,206 2,868 x 1,320 Pixel density 460 ppi 460 ppi 460 ppi 460 ppi Processor A18 A18 A18 Pro A18 Pro Mobile software iOS 18 iOS 18 iOS 18 iOS 18 Camera (megapixels) 48MP fusion camera, 12MP ultrawide camera 48MP fusion camera, 12MP ultrawide camera 48MP fusion camera, 48MP ultrawide camera, 5x telephoto 48MP fusion camera, 48MP ultrawide camera, 5x telephoto Front-facing camera 12-megapixel 12-megapixel 12-megapixel 12-megapixel Video capture 4K up to 60fps 4K up to 60fps 4K up to 120fps 4K up to 120fps Battery/charging speeds Up to 22 hours video playback Up to 27 hours video playback Up to 27 hours video playback Up to 33 hours video playback Fingerprint sensor None (Face ID) None (Face ID) None (Face ID) None (Face ID) Connector USB-C USB-C USB-C USB-C\n\nWhat colors do the iPhone 16 models come in?\n\n\n\niPhone 16E: Black and white\n\nBlack and white iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus: Black, white, pink, teal (green) and ultramarine (blue)\n\nBlack, white, pink, teal (green) and ultramarine (blue) iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max: Black titanium, white titanium, natural titanium and desert titanium\n\nHow do iPhone 16 trade-in offers work?\n\nSome carriers are offering up to $1,000 on eligible trade-ins, which could net you an iPhone 16 Pro for free. One important thing to keep in mind is that most trade-in deals from carriers require you to become a customer, and they often apply to the priciest plan options.\n\nSelect retailers with trade-in programs could offer gift cards toward future purchases instead, so you don't necessarily have to be locked into a contract to take advantage of the savings you can get from parting with your old device. However, those offers may not provide as much of a deal as traditional trade-in offers.\n\nWe first saw the new iPhone 16 models in the demo room at Apple headquarters in California.

Select locations will also offer fans access to exclusive merchandise. .\n\n\u201cSuper Bowl LIX is the most anticipated sporting event of the year but few get to experience it in person; we wanted to bring that collective excitement and energy to fans across the country with once-in-a-lifetime access they\u2019ll never forget,\" Verizon CMO Leslie Berland said in a statement.\n\nBeginning Jan. 3, fans will have the opportunity to enter for a chance at free tickets for themselves and guests to their team\u2019s FanFast via a dedicated campaign page.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nTo promote its big FanFest gameday party, Verizon is also releasing a campaign video depicting Verizon helicopters transporting the Super Bowl to various participating cities.\n\nFanFest activations will include local food vendors and entertainment; interactive in-stadium experiences including football-themed activities on the field; and a chance to meet such NFL legends as former New York Giants running back Tiki Barber, former Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Derrick Brooks and former Kansas City Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles.\n\nThe campaign could suggest a new Big Game advertising playbook for Verizon, emphasizing a more local focus across NFL team markets. During a recent earnings call with inventors to discuss its Q3 earnings report, Verizon Consumer Group CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath cited a return to \u201cthe local market structure, local sales incentives, local marketing,\u201d as one reason for brand momentum.\n\nThe campaign also arrives as Verizon attempts to build up revenue generated by its \u201cperks\u201d offerings to customers.\n\nSampath noted the importance of ensuring such perks were sufficiently \u201ccompelling\u201d to subscribers in order to achieve success. \u201cIt's going to have to be exclusive to Verizon and something our customers want and they can save money with it,\u201d he said, describing one aspect of the strategy as providing \u201cbucket list type opportunities,\u201d such as \u201conce-in-a-lifetime events for NFL, NHL, NBA and some of the best musical acts out there.\u201d",

Regardless of whether you're looking for that next upgrade or a completely new plan, you'll be able to easily compare all your options (and available discounts) right here.\n\nRight now is a superb time to be checking out Verizon deals, too. Not only have we just added the latest Galaxy S25 flagships from Samsung, but the carrier's deals on iPhones have also just been refreshed. Currently, for example, you don't even need to trade-in to get up to four iPhone 16 Pro's for free alongside a new line on one of the carrier's MyPlan unlimited plans. Unlike before, this promotion is now available on the budget 'Welcome' plan, which makes it a much more obtainable deal than previously.\n\nAlongside Verizon deals for devices, you'll also find great options for simply porting your number over to the carrier. Got your own device? The good news is you can currently port over up to 4 lines onto an unlimited data plan and get each line for as little as $25 per month. Verizon has also been massively improving its deals on home internet packages over recent months. Right now, for example, you can get either a 43-inch Samsung TV or the excellent Meta Quest 3S VR headset - both of which are worth $300 if you bought them outright.\n\nWhile you're here, if you're interested in comparing these promotions to what other carriers are offering, head on over to our main best cell phone deals. If you're still unsure about whether Verizon is the carrier for you or need a little more advice regarding phones, head on over to our best Verizon plans and the best Verizon phones pages respectively.\n\nBrowse all the latest deals at Verizon now\n\nThe best Verizon deals available today\n\niPhone deals\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro: free with a new unlimited line at Verizon\n\nVerizon has just posted what's easily one of its best deals yet on the excellent iPhone 16 Pro. Firstly, you can get this device (which is still worth $1,000) for free alongside a new unlimited data line. That's a great deal, albeit one that we've seen the carrier feature previously. What is new, however, is that this particular promo is now available on the carrier's budget-friendly Welcome Unlimited plan - which means you can get up to four devices for free alongside a plan that costs just $25/mo per line($100 in total). If none of the above appeals, then you can instead trade-in for a free device and get a free Apple Watch and iPad as bonus gifts (accessory cellular lines are also required).\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max: $33.33 $5/mo with an unlimited plan, plus free iPad and Apple Watch at Verizon\n\nIf you like the look of the above promotion on the iPhone 16 Pro but would prefer a larger device, then you're in luck. This week's best Verizon deals also extend to the excellent iPhone 16 Pro Max. This flagship device is available for just $5/mo alongside a new line on an Ultimate unlimited plan as well as a free iPad and Apple Watch if you're willing to pay the small monthly surcharge for their cellular lines.\n\nApple iPhone 16e: $5/mo with an unlimited plan, or up to $600 off with a trade-in at Verizon\n\nVerizon's opening iPhone 16e promotion features two deals to check out. You can either trade-in an old device to potentially get the device for free thanks to a maximum rebate of up to $600 off, or you can instead just get it on an unlimited line for $5/mo. Both are pretty good but it's worth noting that Verizon is currently giving the standard iPhone 16 away for free on either a Plus or Ultimate plan. Unless you're going for a line on the basic Welcome unlimited plan, then it definitely makes sense to opt for the pricier flagship device!\n\nApple iPhone 16: free with a new line, plus free iPad and Apple Watch with an unlimited plan at Verizon\n\nAnd. here's that excellent Verizon deal on the standard iPhone 16 to compare to. As stated, the carrier is currently giving this one away with a new line on either a Plus or Ultimate plan and you can also throw in a free Apple Watch SE and a free iPad. The free accessories are fantastic here but do note that you will need to pay a little extra for some accessory cellular line, which are required for you to claim the devices free of charge.\n\nSee all the iPhone deals at Verizon\n\nAndroid deals\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: free with an unlimited plan, plus free tablet and watch\n\nVerizon's just surprised us with the best deal yet on the stunning Galaxy S25 Ultra. Almost unbelievably, right now you don't even need a trade-in rebate to get this stunning premium device for free. All you need is a new line on the Ultimate unlimited plan and the carrier is willing to waive the entire $1,200 cost of this device over the duration of your plan. Also, as a bonus you can throw in a free Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE, although note that cellular lines are paid separately for accessories and required.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Plus: free with a trade-in and unlimited plan, plus free tablet and watch at Verizon\n\nVerizon's deal on the new Galaxy S25 Plus is easily one of the strongest carrier options on the market right now. The setup of this deal is essentially the same as the one on the iPhone 16 above. All you need is a new line on either a Plus or Ultimate unlimited plan and you can claim a free device without needing to trade in. On top of that, Verizon is also offering a free Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE as bonus gifts, although you will have to pay a little extra per month on associated cellular lines if you claim these.\n\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: free with new line, plus free Pixel Watch and tablet Verizon\n\nIt's not just the Galaxy S25 Ultra that's received a great deal with this week's Verizon promotions - you'll also be able to snag the Pixel 9 Pro XL for free alongside a new line on an Ultimate plan. This is again the first time we've seen this premium device for free without the usual trade-in rebate and you can also throw in a free Pixel Watch 2 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE if you're willing to pay for the associated cellular lines.\n\nGoogle Pixel 9: free with new line, plus free Pixel Watch and tablet Verizon\n\nLike the look of the above Verizon deals but don't want a line on the expensive Ultimate plan? Today's promotion on the Pixel 9 could be a good option. You can get this device for free on a Plus line instead, which should be a lot easier on the wallet over the duration of a 36-month plan. Note, you can also throw in a free Pixel Watch 2 and Galaxy tablet if you want some cheap accessories, too.\n\nSee all the Android devices available at Verizon\n\nUpgrade & plan deals\n\nVerizon: add a second line to your account for $10 per month\n\nVerizon's latest deal allows existing customers to add a second line to their phone for just $10 per month. That's a second line with unlimited data, texts and calls for a super low price. Note, however, that you will need a dual-SIM compatible smartphone and this is a limited-time-only promotion - so don't hang around if you're interested.\n\nSwitch: get up to four lines for $25/mo\n\nThe perfect multi-line Verizon deal for those looking to set up some new lines at the carrier. This particular promotion will get you $180 off up to four lines over a 36-month duration when you bring your devices over. Unlike with other similar promotions at other carriers you can keep your phone number with this deal.\n\nSwitch: get $540 when you bring your own device\n\nDon't want a new device? No problem - Verizon also offers up to $540 promo credit for those who bring their device over from a rival carrier. Note that this credit is applied over 36 months and only applies to unlimited data plans. You'll also need to be on the Unlimited Plus plan to get the full amount (you'll get $180 with the Unlimited Plus plan).\n\nPlan deal: students save up to $25/mo with unlimited plans\n\nVerizon offers a hefty discount for actively enrolled students, with a saving of up to $25 per month on the Welcome Unlimited plan. From the small print, it appears that you can have up to two lines with this promo and it also applies if you bring your own device. You will, however, need to log in to prove your eligibility.\n\nSee all plans and upgrade deals at Verizon\n\nInternet deals\n\nVerizon home internet: get a free Samsung TV or Meta Quest 3S\n\nVerizon's deals don't just cover phones this week, you'll also find great freebies available with its 5G Home internet packages. Right now, new customers can either get a free 43-inch Samsung TV or a Meta Quest 3S VR headset when they switch over from a rival carrier. Of the two, I'd probably go for the headset here as the TV is on the small side but having an extra TV could be handy depending on your needs. Both gifts are worth $300 so they aren't small bonuses by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nVerizon FIOS: get a free Samsung TV or Meta Quest 3S\n\nSick of slow internet? If you can get it in your local area Verizon FIOS is a fantastic choice with its incredible fiber-optic speeds. Right now, those same freebies are available with these super-speedy home internet packages. For a limited time only, you'll be able to get either a free Samsung 43-inch TV or a Meta Quest 3S headset, both valued at around $300.\n\nVerizon Fios internet: from $25/mo when you bundle in a mobile plan\n\nVerizon deals don't just stop at mobile devices, they also extend to home internet packages. If you're looking to cut down on your bills in their entirety, it's a great idea to consider switching up your pricey home internet setup to a more consolidated option. While Fios by itself starts at $49.99/mo as a standalone package, those with an existing Verizon mobile plan can bundle in their home internet for as little as $25/mo, a significant saving.\n\nTablet deals\n\nApple iPad (2022): $180 off with a trade, or free with an iPhone purchase\n\nSuperb iPhone bundle option: The 10th generation iPad is a great choice for an everyday tablet at Verizon with the carrier's option to bundle it in for free alongside any eligible iPhone purchase. While the cheapest device in the range, this one is a great pick if you're looking for a quality do-it-all tablet for streaming, games, and productivity. It's not as powerful as the other tablets (see below), but it'll give you great bang for the buck.\n\nApple iPad Pro 11 (2024): $180 off with a trade, or $280 off with an iPhone purchase\n\nThe brand new iPad Pro 11 is available with a superb deal at Verizon this week, with either a healthy trade-in rebate of up to $180 or a massive $280 discount alongside an eligible iPhone purchase. With a powerful M4 chipset, gorgeous OLED display, and incredibly wafer-thin design, the latest iPad Pro is the slate of choice for those in need of serious power. See this same deal on the 13-inch model.\n\nApple iPad Air 11 (2024): $180 off with a trade, or $280 off with an iPhone purchase\n\nLooking for a premium Apple tablet but don't want to go for the super pricey Pro models? The latest iPad Air is a superb choice - especially since this week's Verizon deals also offer some great ways to save. Either trade-in for a discount of up to $180 or get a respectable $280 off with an eligible 5G iPhone purchase. Both are great deals, and enough to significantly cut the latest Air's price tag right down to size. See this same deal on the 13-inch model.\n\nApple iPad mini (2021): $180 off with a trade, or $280 off with an iPhone purchase\n\nAnd, if you prefer a smaller-sized tablet, that same excellent Verizon trade-in deal is also available on the latest Apple iPad Mini. At just 8-inches, this tablet is much smaller and more bag-friendly than the other iPads. As you'd expect, however, it's still really powerful and features the same great design as its bigger siblings.\n\nSee all tablet deals at Verizon\n\nAccessory deals\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: free with Galaxy phones, or up to $180 off with a trade-in\n\nLike with the Apple Watch SE, this week's Verizon deals are also offering an exceptional promotion on the brand new Galaxy Watch 7. Right now, you can bundle this one in with any of the latest flagship Samsung Galaxy devices as long as you're eligible and willing to pay the $5/mo extra for a cellular line. Note, if you want this device by itself, then you can also trade-in an older smartwatch for discount of up to $180 off.\n\nApple Watch Series 9: up to $180 off with a trade-in at Verizon\n\nThe Apple Watch series 9 is the latest and greatest smartwatch from the brand, complete with a superb always-on display, speedy chip, and innovative new health-tracking features. Right now, the carrier is offering a trade-in rebate of up to $180 on this model, which essentially matches the similar promotions you'll find on the iPads right now.\n\nApple Watch SE 2022: up to $180 off with a trade-in at Verizon\n\nThis week's best Verizon deals also cover the excellent Apple Watch SE - the more 'budget' orientated device of the two new Apple smartwatches. Verizon has experimented with giving this one away for free alongside the high-end iPhones in recent months but right now it's discounts are locked behind a trade-in. This is still a good deal if you need a new smartwatch but we'd recommend checking-in over Black Friday if you want to pair up a free Apple Watch with your shiny new Apple device.\n\nSee all the accessory deals at Verizon\n\nIf you haven't found the Verizon deals you're looking for this week, feel free to bookmark this page and return next week.

            "content": "Good news for investors: Telecom stocks aren't as expensive as you might think.\n\nTelecom stocks were in a funk earlier this week, with shares of Verizon (VZ -0.32%), AT&T (T 1.88%), and T-Mobile (TMUS -1.20%) all tumbling on Tuesday, after comments from Verizon chief revenue officer Frank Boulben, given at a Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference, caused telecommunications sectors to freak out just a little bit.\n\nGiven a few days to digest the news, however, investors seem to have concluded today that things aren't quite as bleak as they seem. As of 11 a.m. ET, all three stocks are bouncing back, with Verizon gaining 1.8%, AT&T up 1.9%, and T-Mobile doing best of all with a 2.5% gain.\n\nHow Verizon spooked the market\n\nAs Reuters reported Tuesday, Verizon exec Boulben commented that Verizon is trying to ratchet back promotional activity to shore up its profits, but some of its rivals are going in the other direction, leading to \"elevated ... competitive intensity\" and more price competition in the sector (read: a price war).\n\nVerizon warned that this could lead to \"soft\" wireless subscriber growth for it in Q1 2025. Industry analysts were quick to chime in, predicting that mobile subscriber growth seems to be slowing in general, and warning that if telecoms focus too much on stealing customers from each other, rather than growing the market and adding value generally, this won't be great for profits.\n\nAnd of course, continuing worries about the effects of President Trump's tariffs didn't help matters.\n\nWorries subside\n\nIt's hard to see how raising tariffs on physical goods imports into the U.S., however, is going to have too much of an effect upon U.S. providers of wireless phone services. While tariffs might raise the cost of importing new phones for subscribers, they can presumably use their existing phones just as easily -- and spend the same amount of time talking, texting, and surfing the internet with them, for that matter, all of which generates revenue for AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile just the same as before.\n\nAt the same time, inflation worries seem to be subsiding, with the most recent inflation report coming in cooler than expected, and today's Bureau of Labor Statistics producer price index was flat against January.\n\nInvestors may also be weighing the potential for new forms of telecommunications services, notably direct-to-cell satellite communications from companies such as SpaceX Starlink and AST SpaceMobile, to help grow the telecom business generally. The easier it is to use cellphones, after all, the more likely people are going to be to use them, and to pay for them.\n\nAnd with their plans to use satellites to eliminate cellphone dead zones, Starlink and AST are making this easier than ever before.\n\nMake the call: Which telecom stock would you buy?\n\nAll that really leaves us to do, therefore, as investors, is decide: Which telecom stock should I buy? Are any of them bargains?\n\nLet's take a quick look at the numbers:\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Five-Year Projected Growth Rate Dividend Yield Net Debt AT&T 16.9 1.2% 4.3% $142.5 billion T-Mobile 25.8 20.3% 1.4% $109.5 billion Verizon 10.2 2% 6.4% $167.5 billion\n\nCrunching the numbers, AT&T stands out as probably the most overvalued telecom stock. While expected to outgrow Verizon slightly, AT&T pays an inferior dividend yield and costs significantly more than Verizon.\n\nThat leaves investors with two stocks to choose from. If you're more of a growth investor, T-Mobile will probably appeal to you more with its superior projected growth rate offsetting its relatively high valuation. More conservative, value-oriented and income-desiring investors, on the other hand, may find the cheap P/E ratio and generous dividend yield at Verizon more attractive.\n\nEither way, I have to say that investors who are buying back these stocks today appear to have noticed something sooner than the rest of us: Telecom stocks, as a group, are not overpriced after all. In fact, whether you're a growth investor, a value investor, or a dividend investor, there's very likely a \"right\" telecom stock for you.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to share his thoughts about the massive stock market crash on Monday. The tumble saw the flagship S&P index lose $4 trillion from its February peak to end up lower since President Trump\u2019s election win. Naturally, Cramer was full of thoughts about the President and how he might help markets. He started by outlining that the narrative surrounding tariffs could hurt President Trump, despite the fact that the US might very well need tariffs to balance the scales of global trade in its favor.\n\nCramer started out by sharing:\n\n\u201cBut, look let\u2019s just, we gotta come back to the President. You can\u2019t really watch the stock market when he said that tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we have ever done as a country. I call everyone\u2019s attention to the Washington Post piece this morning. Which says the base doesn\u2019t like tariffs. They\u2019re giving it thirty to thirty five percent people of the base who like tariffs. They have not been explained well.\u201d\n\nIn fact, despite the fact that the narrative surrounding tariffs has generated concerns about a recession, Cramer believes that the President is actually being too soft.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m looking at this and I\u2019m saying, and you know I support these tariffs, I\u2019m much harder on tariffs than he is,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think he [Trump] is being soft on tariffs. Because these, our partners, so-called partners have been ripping us up for ages. He\u2019s right about that,\u201d Cramer added.\n\nHowever, while the President might be right about tariffs, Cramer disagrees with him on the messaging. He believes that Trump\u2019s \u201cgotta be a little more like TR [Theodore Roosevelt]. You gotta speak softly and carry a big stick.\u201d On the flip side, the President\u2019s approach, which according to Cramer resembles \u201cspeak loud with no stick\u201d is \u201cwhat the bullies do.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC TV host also criticized Canada\u2019s approach in taking on Trump when it came to tariffs. \u201c[Y]ou don\u2019t want to do that. Now I wouldn\u2019t have done what Canada did, which is you know, fight back. You have to do it like Scheinbaum. But I just think that we\u2019re courting with a manufactured recession,\u201d he outlined.\n\nCramer cited former US Presidents and their approach to tariffs in his comments. President Trump repeatedly stated that he was a fan of President William McKinley, who held office from 1897 to 1901. However, Cramer believes that Trump should also consider Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s approach:",

Verizon has already begun a new project to invest in Woodbridge by building the infrastructure necessary to bring FIOS to the township,\" McCormac said.\n\n\"Optimum had applied for permits to build 10 sites to house their fiber-only infrastructure for yet another option for our consumers,\" the mayor said. \"Both will be up and running in some sections of town later this year with expectations of full wiring within three years.\"\n\nMcCormac said he is also looking to have abandoned commercial properties like Jammer's bar on Route 35 in the Avenel section and Liberty Tavern in Fords come back into productive use.\n\nMore: State removes two dozen animals from embattled zoo in Woodbridge. What's next?\n\nHe said the state has begun design on a new Cutters Dock Bridge into the Pennval site, but the project still has a four-year timeframe, and Middlesex County has approved a new traffic light at West Avenue and Milos Way in Port Reading to make traveling on the roads safer.\n\nThe township remains interested in a health care use for the former Premier Die Casting site on Rahway Avenue in the Avenel section.\n\nRecreational enhancements also are expected this year.\n\nAccording to McCormac, the Pine Barrens Pond on Industrial Road in the Keasbey section, which underwent an environmental remediation, is slated to be activated this year. The area will include walking trails, picnic area and a fishing pond. The pond is near the Woodbridge Wetlands Park which is under review by state and federal agencies before it can open this year.\n\nThe town is also hoping to start construction this year on a new larger dog park behind the existing in the Sewaren section while providing additional parking on the existing dog park site.\n\nAnd Middlesex County is funding a new bridge from the township's property across Smith's Creek to the county-owned Alvin P. Williams Memorial Park, also in the Sewaren section, the mayor said.\n\nEmail: srussell@gannettnj.com\n\nSuzanne Russell is a breaking news reporter for MyCentralJersey.com covering crime, courts and other mayhem.

Believe it or not, one of the biggest problems within hospitals is communication,\u201d he said.\n\nVerizon Business provides the infrastructure to improve nurse-to-physician and nurse-to-nurse communications.\n\nSticking with healthcare, the operator also uses 5G to manage device inventories in hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking that any hospital organisation can track 10 per cent of devices in the hospital every single day, and they take time to get the devices, which might be helpful to save lives,\u201d he noted. \u201cPut it all together, the number of use cases is enormous.\u201d\n\nPublic and private 5G networks are also valuable for securely transferring patent data such as MRIs or X-rays.\n\nPeselli said remote healthcare is benefitting from new technologies such as network slicing on public 5G networks to allocate a portion of a spectrum to a specific application.\n\nHe stated those types of services can alert patients and doctors in real time when a problem at home occurs.\n\n\u201cAnd all of that may expand the intelligence of the hospital to your home at scale,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here to view the interview in full.",

            "content": "Sowmyanarayan Sampath is the CEO of Verizon Consumer Group.\n\nHe is also a dad to two sons, ages 12 and 15.\n\nHe avoids phones in front of his kids but doesn't set specific time limits for his sons.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sowmyanarayan Sampath, executive vice president and CEO of Verizon Consumer Group. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the CEO of Verizon and also the dad of two boys, who are 12 and 15. They got phones when they were about 10, which is when they started walking places and going to activities without my wife and me. The phones were a tool to coordinate with them.\n\nWhen it comes to digital wellness for teens, I'm like patient 0, right in the middle of it. I see no conflict at all between running a digital communication corporation and telling others to put the phone down. Here's what that looks like for my family.\n\nWe believe technology is good\n\nMy wife and I started conversations about phones with the foundational belief that technology is good. I think smartphones are one of the most important human inventions of the last 1,000 years. They're beneficial for knowledge, connection, safety, and fun.\n\nYet, I try to avoid being on my phone in front of my sons. My wife and I set limits around when and how our boys can use their phones. We don't see this issue as black and white, good or bad. I think that's where many digital wellness campaigns fail: they miss the nuance in this conversation.\n\nI want phones to enhance real life\n\nThese days, the average teen spends about five hours on social media and picks up their phone hundreds of times each day. I don't want that for my sons. I want phones to enhance their lives, not detract from them.\n\nThat means taking time away from the phones to create space for other fun things in life, including learning, physical activity, and relationships. We encourage phone-free time and don't allow social media until they are 13.\n\nI try to make phone-free time fun. I know I'm competing with the phone for my sons' attention. Watching a football game together, going for ice cream, or even walking the neighborhood makes it easier for them to put their phones down.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWe don't allow phones at the dining table or at night\n\nWe have two strict boundaries about phone use: no phones at the kitchen table when we're having a meal and no phones in the bedroom at night. At first, we had the boys put their phones on the kitchen counter during meals, but now we don't have to do that. They know not to check their phones, even if they're in their pockets.\n\nWhen the boys were allowed to have their phones in their rooms after lights out, we noticed that they'd wake up groggy or tired. Now, they charge their phones downstairs at night. My wife and I do the same thing because we want to lead by example.\n\nI avoid being on the phone around them\n\nI want to be present when I'm with my sons, so I avoid using the phone around them. I don't doom scroll or even joy scroll when they're with me.\n\nI'm most intentional about this on the weekends. On Saturdays and Sundays, I don't check my phone until noon. That gives me uninterrupted family time to go to sports practices, birthday parties, and other activities. As the CEO of a global company, I know that if there's a major emergency, my team will find a way to reach me.\n\nWe don't set specific time limits\n\nMy wife and I use the Verizon Family app to monitor our kids' phone use, including who they're messaging with, the apps they use, and their screen time. It also helps us teach them responsible use: If I tell my sons to put down their phones, they might not listen, but if I show them they've already spent three hours on it, they're more likely to join me for a swim or a basketball game.\n\nStill, we don't set specific screen limits. My kids have shown they're responsible and can balance time with and without their phones. That's more important to me than giving them an arbitrary limit. Some days, they spend more time on the phone than others, like if they're using it to research school projects.\n\nWe encourage calling rather than text\n\nMy family loves video calls. I will always answer a call from my wife or sons, even if I'm in a meeting and need to just say, \"I'll call you back.\" We regularly video call the grandparents, cousins, and extended family because it provides a much more robust connection than you can get over text. I encourage the boys to call friends, but they mostly chat.\n\nI understand this won't always be perfect\n\nSometimes, we all have bad or busy days. In those days, we learned more heavily about technology and the passive entertainment phones can provide. That's OK. Being mindful about technology is an ongoing daily conversation.",

This has boosted subscriber additions but raised worries about profits.\n\nShares of AT&T fell 5.3% as the company also flagged elevated subscriber churn for January, while T-Mobile US is down 4%.\n\n\"The opportunity of adding mobile subscribers is shrinking,\" said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore, adding that broadband majors such as Comcast were also courting wireless customers with an aggressive strategy.\n\nVerizon has flagged \"a slow start\" to phone upgrades in the first quarter, a sign that customers were holding back on purchases amid mounting worries about the health of the U.S. economy and a lack of major new features in the devices.\n\nHowever, it reiterated its target of single-digit growth in annual phone upgrades, betting on a rebound later this year.\n\nThe company also expects to add more monthly-bill paying wireless subscribers in 2025 than the around 900,000 it added last year, as it benefits from its customizable myPlan.\n\nThe comments follow a strong fourth quarter for U.S. telecom firms, powered by plans that bundled 5G services with high-speed fiber data and streaming services.\n\nLIMITED IMPACT FROM TIGHTER IMMIGRATION\n\nVerizon and AT&T said they did not expect a big hit from tighter U.S. immigration policies.\n\nSince taking office in January, President Donald Trump has kicked off a sweeping immigration crackdown, tasking the U.S. military with aiding border security and issuing a broad ban on asylum. That has raised worries that the pool of new customers for telecom companies could shrink.\n\n\"We expect very limited impact on postpaid where customers have got to provide some form of identification to get onto a contract. If there is any impact, we will see it towards the low end of the prepaid market,\" Verizon's Boulben said.\n\nAT&T and Verizon also played down worries about competition from satellite internet providers such as SpaceX's Starlink, saying that wireless was more reliable and cost-effective.",

Gross new additions in the first quarter are expected to be flat or down from a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nIn January, Verizon had raised prices on customers with five or more phone lines and those on an older plan it no longer offers, according to a report from CNET. It also increased an administrative fee by 20 cents on all plans in December, the report said. A price increase on Verizon\u2019s multi-device protection plan is scheduled to go into effect later this month.\n\nCustomers are also waiting longer now than in previous years to upgrade their devices, Boulben said, with the average customer keeping their devices for more than 41 months.\n\nBoulben said he expects higher prices could generate more than $1 billion in additional service revenue this year, and that customer churn could be lower in 2025 than 2024 despite near-term headwinds. He reiterated the company's forecast for wireless service revenue to grow by 2% to 2.8% this year.

Management expects that subscriber growth will be pressured in the near term, and investors sold shares in response.\n\nVerizon stock sinks on tough wireless outlook\n\nCompetition for new wireless subscribers continues to be intense, and Verizon says that the dynamic will likely lead to soft subscriber growth this quarter. Speaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference, Verizon chief revenue officer Frank Boulben said that Verizon had cut back on aggressive promotional campaigns from the fourth quarter -- but other players in the space had continued to aggressively pursue subscriber additions.\n\nEven through today's pullback, Verizon stock is still up 8% across 2025's trading.\n\nWhat's next for Verizon?\n\nDespite relatively soft phone upgrade trends and a tough competitive landscape, Verizon still expects to surpass the 900,000 net postpaid wireless subscriber additions it recorded last year. So while the company expects that growth for net wireless subscribers this quarter will be negatively impacted by a level of promotional push that's below key competitors, it's possible that the longer-term impact of this dynamic will be relatively muted.\n\nFollowing today's pullback, Verizon is trading at roughly 9.3 times this year's expected earnings and sports a dividend yield of 6.2%. For long-term investors seeking reliable dividend income, today's price drop could be a worthwhile buying opportunity. The stock has solid defensive characteristics, and it's possible that the market is significantly overreacting to the company's recent comments.",

            "content": "Ahead of Mobile World Congress, Verizon put out a good bit of news, most of which speaks broadly to how it\u2019s laying the groundwork for its long-term network evolution. To briefly call a few out:\n\nIn January, the company delineated six tech trends to watch in 2025: cloud-native networks, network slicing use cases, Open RAN is ready, an \u201cAI inflection\u201d is nigh, the API conversation is developing and promises value-add for customers, satellite D2D is progressing.\n\nVirtualized network architectures are important in high-density user environments like the Super Bowl: it\u2019s scalable and flexible, new services and applications can be brought to life fast, it\u2019s cost-effective and it enhances reliability\n\nOn the AI front, Verizon has deployed a multi-vendor RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) using Qualcomm\u2019s Dragonwing RAN Automation Suite and it\u2019s running Samsung\u2019s AI-powered Energy Saving Manager app.\n\nVerizon Executive Vice President and President of Global Networks and Technology Joe Russo sat with me in a cafe on the edge of Hall 3 at Mobile World Congress to catch up. He and Verizon\u2019s CTO Yago Tenorio were coming from a meeting on the Intel stand which was interesting and, as you\u2019ll see, relevant. We were both wearing Ray-Ban Meta Glasses. I had a cortado, he had a soda. Scene set.\n\nI wanted to know what the RIC strategy was because I didn\u2019t necessarily have the announcement of a commercial RIC deployment on my bingo card. Russo said Verizon built an in-house platform called vSON in \u201canticipation of where we\u2019re starting to really see movement today.\u201d That platform covers basic network management, automation and orchestration. That builds on Verizon\u2019s vRAN efforts and Verizon Cloud Platform capabilities. \u201cThat becomes the foundation, and I think now we\u2019re well-positioned to onboard apps as they\u2019re being developed.\u201d\n\nBut the RIC and app strategy, he said, is \u201cbest of breed.\u201d Not to be condescending but as a friendly reminder, best of breed products excel in very specific functions and typically integrate with other tools in a larger tech stack. Best in class products are widely recognized as the highest-performing or most effective in a category or a domain. The difference hinges on niche vs. broad.\n\nBack to Russo: \u201cI don\u2019t want a vertically integrated platform. I want you [the potential vendor] to come up with best of breed to do a function,\u201d like channel optimization or energy management or whatever it happens to be. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get locked into one stack vs. another.\u201d So best of breed apps that are abstracted up into a co-pilot that brings it all together.\n\nOK, so what about automation; how do you get from open loops to closed loops? \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet, but we see the vision where it\u2019s closed loop at some point.\u201d It\u2019s a process of testing/refining, testing/refining, then it\u2019s a go-live, he said. \u201cToday we have, I\u2019d say, at least a half-dozen apps that are running on our network.\u201d\n\nAs things develop, the goal is a general-purpose network (also a term I heard a T-Mobile US exec use) for 4G, NSA 5G, SA 5G, fixed, mobile, IoT, etc\u2026So in pursuit of the goal, \u201cWhat kind of tools do we need to optimize the network for that?\u201d Verizon\u2019s competitive advantage, he said, is performance engineering. \u201cThis is what they do all day across the country,\u201d but complexity is ramping up and the engineers would benefit from more and more real-time insight.\n\nAnd what might that mean for the org and the workflows? \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a lifecycle of learning. This is what we talk about all the time at Verizon\u2026There are more things that we want to do than we have hours in the day to do them. Any edge we can get to free up a minute of an engineer\u2019s time so they can focus on the next value-added thing is our strategy\u2014plain and simple.\u201d\n\nThat means getting the data, getting the insight, building the apps, examining the outputs, analyzing whether the outputs reflect reality and then taking an action. In terms of developing trust\u2014closing the loop\u2014it\u2019s never 100%, he said. But people aren\u2019t either. If we can get to 90-plus-percent, Russo said, we want to close the loop.\n\nOne last thing, perhaps top of mind fresh off of sitting with Intel; how are you thinking about the edge inference opportunity, GPUaaS, all of that? \u201cOur view is that the vast majority, if not all of that, can happen on CPUs,\u201d Russo said. The economics of edge GPUs throw the economic cost/benefit dynamics out of whack. But that\u2019s \u201cnot to say we\u2019re not working in that space.\u201d",

            "content": "Analysts advise investors against favoring a single investment strategy. JP Morgan noted that large technology companies are widely held both individually and within major indices. As a result, significant market fluctuations can occur when developments\u2014such as the recent introduction of a Chinese large language model in late January\u2014impact the sector. However, the firm does not recommend actively betting against the dominant tech giants that hold the largest weightings in the broader market.\n\nThe report highlighted several key drivers behind this trend. Strong employment numbers, easing inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start cutting interest rates have bolstered investor confidence, prompting a broader market rally beyond the dominant mega-cap stocks. Additionally, sectors that are more sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have benefited from a lower-rate environment.\n\nMuch of the Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies now make up over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, market dynamics have started to shift in recent months, with value stocks gaining traction. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index surged 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% rise in the Russell Growth Index, according to a report from BlackRock.\n\nFormer professor-turned-investment manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing specialist David Dreman strongly advocated for a patient, long-term approach to investing, believing that steady, disciplined strategies often outperform rapid, high-growth ones. Their research indicated that value investing tends to outperform growth strategies approximately 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. After analyzing companies across different market capitalizations, they found that, over long periods, value stocks consistently generated average annual returns slightly above 7%, surpassing the performance of growth stocks.\n\nValue investing has remained a favored approach among investors for years, largely popularized by Warren Buffett, who continues to focus on stocks he believes are undervalued relative to their true worth. While growth investing has dominated market sentiment in recent times, the long-term performance of value stocks remains solid.\n\nWe recently published a list of 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against other best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDrawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, JP Morgan highlighted that the leading companies of that era traded at forward price-to-earnings ratios between 50x and 75x. In contrast, most of today\u2019s mega-cap stocks are valued at roughly half of those peak multiples. The firm further advised investors to diversify beyond growth equities, particularly by considering financial stocks. Alongside industrials, a balanced approach between growth and value stocks remains its preferred strategy.\n\nStocks that pay dividends are often associated with value investing, as they generally provide higher yields and demonstrate stronger financial stability compared to growth stocks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, investment strategies centered on generating income tend to share traits commonly found in value stocks. Companies with attractive dividend yields and lower valuations often capture investor attention.\n\nHowever, the report also pointed out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index does not adhere strictly to a value-focused approach. Instead, it maintains a mix of both growth and value stocks. A long-term review of the index, covering the period from 1999 to 2022, indicated that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings were classified as value stocks, while 40.94% fell into the growth category.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 6. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected 13 companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2023. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 9.17\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company that offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. The company is leveraging its solid financial position to speed up the expansion of its fiber network through the $20 billion all-cash acquisition of Frontier Communications. This deal will extend Verizon\u2019s fiber coverage to 25 million locations. While the transaction is expected to close next year, the company anticipates an immediate boost to its earnings and aims to achieve at least $500 million in annual cost savings.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) posted strong fourth-quarter results for 2024, generating $35.7 billion in revenue\u2014a 1.6% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by a rise in customer additions across both mobile wireless and internet services. In the mobile wireless segment, net postpaid phone subscriber additions reached 568,000, up from 449,000 in the same quarter last year. Revenue from this division climbed 3.1% year-over-year to $20 billion, marking its 18th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has drawn investor interest due to its robust cash flow and commitment to innovation. In fiscal 2024, the company reported $37 billion in operating cash flow, while free cash flow increased to $19.8 billion from $18.7 billion the previous year. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.13%, as of March 6.\n\nOverall, VZ ranks 9th on our list of best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

This move comes at a time when contact centers across the nation have been grappling with increasing call volumes while operating with limited staff.\n\nWith this partnership, Verizon can continue providing bespoke digital experiences for their customers even when operating with significantly smaller customer service teams. Google\u2019s Cloud Contact Center AI solution leverages natural language processing (NLP) to provide customers with instant answers to questions while improving agent effectiveness.\n\nAlso read: Cloud Telephony Redefines Customer Service in a Remote Work Set Up: Q&A With Natterbox\n\nThe partnership is expected to help Verizon reduce call times, provide quicker resolutions, and drive improved outcomes for customer satisfaction.\n\n\u201cVerizon\u2019s commitment to innovation extends to all aspects of the customer experience,\u201d said Shankar Arumugavelu, global CIO & SVP, Verizon. \u201cThese customer service enhancements, powered by the Verizon collaboration with Google Cloud, offer a faster and more personalized digital experience for our customers while empowering our customer support agents to provide a higher level of service.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of the solution is that it is both customer- and agent-facing, which means, in addition to providing faster self-service options for customers, it also offers contact center representatives a real-time digital assistant that fetches relevant articles within the knowledge base, and then recommends personalized responses to agents at each turn of the conversation, assisting the agents in effectively answering customer questions and addressing any issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to work with Verizon to help enable its digital transformation strategy,\u201d said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. \u201cBy helping Verizon reimagine the customer experience through our AI and ML expertise, we can create an experience that not only delights consumers, but also helps differentiate Verizon in the market.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Putting the Customer Front & Center: An Interview with Peter Ross of Actifio\n\nGoogle revealed its plans for reinventing contact center experiences at its Cloud Next conference in 2018 and the solution was launched in November, last year. The idea behind Google\u2019s Contact Center AI is helping businesses build smarter, faster, and easy-to-use contact center workflows that leverage the promise of NLP to provide more personalized support, allowing agents to focus on more complex issues.\n\nAre Chatbots a Relic of the Past?\n\nVirtual assistants and bots have been around for some time now. However, there has been much debate on the value they create for businesses. While some might argue that earlier versions of the chatbot served a very real business need, they were little more than interactive FAQ interfaces. They responded to user/customer questions with one sentence replies that didn\u2019t encourage conversation.\n\nSmarter, AI-powered chatbots today are capable of doing much more \u2013 they are able to establish context by looking up databases for past voice calls and customer interactions. This promotes conversation and engagement. Additionally, intelligent contact center software can also improve agent efficiency by empowering them with continuous support during calls.\n\nAlso read: 3 Value Drivers of Voice for Your Business\n\nTechnologies like NLP and machine learning enable the software to transcribe calls in real-time, identify customer intent, and provide real-time step-by-step assistance.\n\nAs the Coronavirus crisis drags on, understaffed businesses are scrambling to do more with less, making AI contact center solutions like Cloud Contact Center and IBM\u2019s Watson particularly valuable.\n\nExperts expect a sharp increase in adoption of AI contact center solutions post the pandemic as organizations are forced to keep their operations lean. This means, contact center jobs already lost may not come back.\n\nHowever, it is too soon to say. And the one thing we certainly know about AI-based solutions is that they are far from perfect at the moment. So, humans-in-the-loop seems like a more plausible future scenario in the contact center context.",

(NYSE:VZ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 65% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nLast week\u2019s 6.9% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 24%.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Verizon Communications.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications\n\nNYSE:VZ Ownership Breakdown March 9th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Verizon Communications does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Verizon Communications, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:VZ Earnings and Revenue Growth March 9th 2025\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Verizon Communications is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.5% of the company stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best Performing Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have taken a backseat in the market as technology and AI-driven equities have soared to record highs. However, analysts at Ned Davis Research believe that a more challenging macroeconomic landscape this year could create opportunities for dividend stocks to regain momentum.\n\nAmid concerns about economic growth and uncertainty surrounding former President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been turning to defensive strategies. In this environment, dividend stocks have proven resilient, offering both stability and attractive passive income. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks companies with a history of at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, has climbed by over 5.3% in 2025. In contrast, the broader market has declined by nearly 1.7%, as of the close of March 7.\n\nREAD ALSO: 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nWhile analysts remain cautious about the market\u2019s ability to sustain its recent gains, dividend stocks have increasingly drawn their attention for several reasons. According to Ameriprise Financial, the S&P index is widely regarded as one of the most significant benchmarks for global equity markets. Over the past decade, dividend growth and share buybacks have become defining characteristics of the index, which includes numerous global dividend-paying companies. Dividend growth saw a sharp slowdown in the final quarter of 2024, largely attributed to the election and uncertainty surrounding potential policy changes. With these concerns now in the past, Ameriprise Financial expects a resurgence in dividend growth within the broader market. For 2025, projections indicate a potential 8% increase in dividend payouts, following growth rates of 6% in 2024 and 5% in 2023.\n\nThe report further mentioned that The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 also played a significant role in boosting dividends and share buybacks in 2018. By lowering the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the legislation contributed to a surge in shareholder returns, with buybacks and dividend payouts reaching multi-year highs the following year. As the TCJA approaches its expiration in 2025, discussions around corporate tax reductions have resurfaced. While the proposed decrease from 21% to 15% is not as substantial as the previous cut, it could still provide an upside for shareholder returns within the broader market once a final decision is reached.\n\nCompanies with a history of regular dividend payments are generally seen as stable investments, reflecting their strong cash flow and financial resilience. These businesses are often found in defensive sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, which tend to be less affected by economic fluctuations. As a result, they help investors manage portfolio risks more effectively. At the beginning of 2025, growing concerns over rising inflation and sluggish economic growth led investors to increase their exposure to defensive stocks. This shift in strategy was intended to protect portfolios from potential market volatility linked to these economic uncertainties.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team shared their perspective on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the list of companies that have delivered positive returns in 2025. From that group, we identified dividend companies with strong dividend policies and stable cash positions. We began with a pool of fifty companies, narrowed it down by considering their share price increases, and ultimately selected the top 14 dividend stocks with the highest share price gains as of March 7, arranging them in ascending order of performance.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds.

(NYSE:VZ) stands against other most undervalued large cap stocks to buy now.\n\nOn March 4, David Katz, Chief Investment Officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, joined \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on CNBC to share his perspective on the current state of the bull market and what February\u2019s mixed action and sector rotation might signal for the rest of the year. Katz acknowledged that while people might not want to hear it, the volatility seen in February is likely to persist throughout the year, with both upside and downside movements. He emphasized that this creates opportunities for investors but also necessitates caution. Katz highlighted several positive factors supporting the market, which included a strong economy and solid corporate performance. However, he expressed concerns about certain policies from the administration, such as tariffs, immigration, and the relationship with the Fed. While these issues have been largely ignored by the market so far, Katz warned that they could eventually lead to a 3-5% correction. Despite this, he remained optimistic about the economy\u2019s ability to navigate these challenges and recommended buying into market dips rather than chasing rallies.\n\nTo support his sentiment, Katz pointed to companies that have already experienced significant corrections and are positioned to perform well regardless of broader market movements. He highlighted their strong fundamentals, attractive valuations (most trading at under 13-14 times earnings), and good outlooks. He also noted that last year\u2019s market leaders have slowed significantly, while sectors that underperformed are beginning to show meaningful improvement, a trend he expects to continue. This sector rotation suggests that investors should be prepared to adapt their strategies as different sectors gain momentum throughout the year.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top stocks trading between $10 billion and $200 billion. We then selected stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 15 and made a list of 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

            "content": "Verizon, IBM, and Cisco are all cheap income plays in this frothy market.\n\nWhen it comes to tech stocks, investors often focus on glitzy growth plays that attract a lot of attention from Wall Street. However, all that buzz can drive the prices and valuations of those stocks to record highs -- which sets them up for steep drawdowns as elevated interest rates and other macro headwinds chill the market.\n\nAs the NASDAQ trades just a few percentage points shy of its all-time high, it might be smart to ignore the market darlings for now and buy a few blue chip tech stocks that trade at cooler valuations and pay healthy dividends. These three stocks fit that description: Verizon (VZ -0.32%), IBM (IBM 1.04%), and Cisco (CSCO 1.39%).\n\n1. Verizon\n\nVerizon's stock sank to a 13-year low of $28.25 on Oct. 13, 2023. At the time, the telecom giant was struggling to gain wireless customers and slashing its prices to stay competitive. But as of this writing, its stock has bounced back to nearly $44.\n\nVerizon's business recovered as it more than doubled its annual postpaid phone net additions in 2024. That acceleration was driven by the localization of its incentives and marketing campaigns, the expansion of its customizable \"myPlans,\" and the growth of its distribution business with Walmart. It also expanded its prepaid wireless segment by acquiring TracFone, while its total wireless churn rate declined 50 basis points to 1.62% for the full year. For 2025, it expects its wireless revenue to rise 2% to 2.8%. Analysts expect its total revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to both rise 2%.\n\nAs Verizon's wireless business warmed up again, it trimmed its spending to offset the pressure from its promotions. Its free cash flow (FCF) rose 6% to $19.8 billion last year and easily covered its $11.2 billion in dividend payments, and it still pays a forward yield of 6.3%. That high yield, along with its low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9, should limit its downside potential and make it a safe place to park your cash and earn some extra income.\n\n2. IBM\n\nIBM was once considered a stagnant tech giant that was left behind in the seismic shift toward cloud-based services. But under Arvind Krishna, its cloud chief who became its CEO in 2020, Big Blue's business gradually recovered.\n\nKrishna took over, IBM spun off its slow-growth managed IT infrastructure services business as Kyndryl, and expanded its open-source software subsidiary Red Hat's presence in the hybrid cloud and AI markets. Instead of going head-to-head against the public cloud giants, IBM aimed to carve out a niche with AI-powered services that could be wedged between the private and public clouds. It also pruned its workforce as it used AI to automate more tasks and trim its spending.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, IBM's revenue and EPS increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3% and 1%, respectively. Those growth rates might seem anemic, but they represent a significant improvement after it endured years of top- and bottom-line declines. That's why its stock price more than doubled over the past three years.\n\nAnalysts expect its revenue and EPS to both grow about 4% this year as the macro environment stabilizes. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.7%. It only paid out 52% of its FCF over the past 12 months as dividends, so it still has plenty of room to raise its payout.\n\n3. Cisco\n\nCisco, one of the world's largest networking companies, struggled in fiscal 2021 and 2022 (which ended in July 2022) as supply chain constraints throttled its sales of routers, switches, and wireless networking devices. In fiscal 2023, its growth accelerated again as it resolved those supply chain issues and its customers ramped up their purchases of new networking hardware again.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Cisco's revenue and earnings both declined because many of its customers had accumulated too many of its products in the previous year -- and the intensifying macro headwinds throttled the deployment of those devices. As a result, its orders stalled out as its existing customers sat on too many uninstalled products.\n\nHowever, analysts expect Cisco's revenue to rise 5% in fiscal 2025 as it overcomes those inventory issues and ships more devices. They expect its adjusted EPS to stay nearly flat, but that pressure can mainly be attributed to its initial costs of integrating Splunk, the network observability services provider it acquired last March.\n\nCisco's stock still looks cheap at 17 times forward earnings, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.6%. It only spent half of its FCF on its dividends over the past 12 months. Its business should stabilize after it fully laps its acquisition of Splunk and it normalizes its inventory levels -- so I believe it's still a reliable choice for conservative investors.",

Reports from Verizon retail staff reveal a growing reliance on the very customer service lines they're meant to bypass, leading to significant delays and dissatisfaction for in-store visitors.Imagine walking into astore seeking assistance with a billing discrepancy or a malfunctioning device. Rather than receiving immediate, direct support from the employee, you might witness them dialing the same customer service number you would use from home. This situation stems from a shift in howhandles certain customer inquiries. Many complex issues, or those requiring access to specific account details, are routed to centralized, often outsourced, customer service centers. Even store employees, with their supposed expertise and direct access, are compelled to engage with this system.This practice introduces several problems. First, it prolongs the customer's wait time. Instead of a quick resolution, the customer is subjected to the same lengthy hold times and potentially inconsistent support that plague remote callers. Secondly, it undermines the perceived value of visiting a physical store. Customers expect in-person assistance to be more efficient and effective than calling a hotline. When store staff are forced to rely on the same system, it erodes customer trust and satisfaction.",

In fact, Apple\u2019s shareholders voted against a proposal that would dismiss its diversity and inclusion program in February 2025. Additionally, Verizon is maintaining its DEI stance and sees it as a vehicle for success.\n\n\u201cVerizon is committed to fostering an inclusive environment. We care about diversity in both our employees and our suppliers. Diversity and inclusion is how we achieve success,\u201d a statement on the company website read. \u201cBy celebrating diversity across all spectrums, including but not limited to race, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, veteran/military status, and age, we are a stronger company and culture.\u201d\n\nIt continued, \u201cWe take pride in our talented and diverse team of people who focus on our customers, every day. Their combined intelligence, spirit and creativity make Verizon a great place to work, learn and grow.\u201d\n\nVerizon\u2019s stance is being frowned upon by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr. According to Bloomberg, Carr, a Republican, is \u201cpleased with the progress that different companies are making on this front\u201d but is \u201cconcerned by the apparent lack of progress at Verizon.\u201d He also wrote a letter to the company, aligning with conservative groups and individuals such as social media activist Robby Starbuck, who has influenced over 15 companies \u2014 including Walmart and Toyota Motor Corp. \u2014 to strip their DEI policies, per Bloomberg. Carr\u2019s letter, which is similar to what he sent to Comcast Corp., states that Verizon\u2019s policies don\u2019t align with the direction of the Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarr also told Verizon that the company should reach out to the FCC staffers working on its acquisition deal of Frontier Communications to remedy the situation since they are the \u201cpersonnel most familiar with Verizon\u2019s operations.\u201d\n\nHowever, FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, responded in an emailed statement, according to Bloomberg, \u201cI strongly oppose conflating policy agendas with an unrelated transaction review. This is even more troubling given that the pleading cycle for this transaction has closed. Leveraging transaction reviews in this fashion sets a dangerous precedent and will only chill investment when it is sorely needed.\u201d\n\nVerizon has responded to Carr\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the chairman\u2019s concerns. We look forward to engaging with the FCC staff on this issue.

            "content": "Given its primary role as a telecommunications provider, it can be easy to overlook the fact that Verizon also is one of the most ubiquitous retailers in the U.S. With more than 8,000 stores, Verizon ranks among the top six largest retailers in the country by store count, outpacing even Walmart. And that number continues to grow \u2014 last year, Verizon added 1,000 stores, and 1,000 more are on the way this year at a pace of two to three openings per day.\n\nThis kind of rapid growth is a sign of the brand\u2019s strength, but not too long ago, Verizon\u2019s consumer business was struggling. \u201cWe had a very rough \u201921 and \u201922 at Verizon Consumer, very rough. We missed guidance twice in a year. We had lost our mojo,\u201d said Sowmyanarayan Sampath, CEO of Verizon Consumer, who took over the division in March 2023.\n\n\u2018The Turnaround Guy\u2019\n\nSowmyanarayan Sampath, CEO of Verizon Consumer (Image courtesy Verizon)\n\nWhile it\u2019s not his official title, Sampath refers to himself the \u201cturnaround guy,\u201d and it\u2019s a perfect description of the role he\u2019s played at Verizon over the last decade. During that time he\u2019s held eight different roles, giving him, as he said, \u201ca half-life of 18 months. I tend to get involved in big turnaround situations and then move into the next thing.\u201d He has worked his magic once again in the consumer division, which has now reported eight consecutive quarters of growth.\n\nBy almost any metric, Verizon\u2019s consumer division is its most important. It accounts for approximately 80% of the Verizon business: 2024 revenues for the consumer business were $102.9 billion out of $134.8 billion in total revenue for the company. The division encompasses \u201ceverything that is needed to sell and take care of customers in our consumer business,\u201d said Sampath, from cell phones and tablets to the FiOS fiber business. It also has, according to Sampath, one of the largest marketing budgets in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot to mention those 8,000 stores (and counting). And in fact, the stores and the employees that staff them have been the key to Sampath\u2019s turnaround of the business. Sampath shared with Retail TouchPoints how employee compensation was the unlock that returned the business to growth, and why he doesn\u2019t believe in pursuing omnichannel perfection.\n\nThe Problem: Lagging Sales\n\nAt its core, the problem with Verizon\u2019s consumer business was a simple matter of not selling enough. The first thing Sampath did to correct this was fix the company\u2019s \u201cprice problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur price premium was too high \u2014 when I joined it was almost 50% over the market,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite how good we are, selling at a 50% price premium is tough to get through the system. So the first thing we did was reduce our price premium to 20%, and what was interesting is that even though we reduced our price premium our incoming revenue from customers actually went up, because people started buying more.\u201d\n\nBut that was just the first step. The other changes Sampath has made are a study in the interconnected nature of employees, stores and communities. They include:\n\nShifting from a group compensation structure to individual compensation for sales reps;\n\nfor sales reps; Decentralizing store operations and encouraging localization in everything from design to staffing to merchandising;\n\nin everything from design to staffing to merchandising; Prioritizing superb digital and store experiences rather than pushing omnichannel perfection; and\n\nrather than pushing omnichannel perfection; and Lightening employees\u2019 cognitive overload with new AI tools.\n\nShifting the Mindset from \u2018Jobs\u2019 to \u2018Careers\u2019\n\nOnce the issues on the product side of the business were resolved (that is, the implementation of more competitive prices), Sampath turned his attention to service. More so than other retailers, Verizon\u2019s stores are critical education, support and selling points for a company that trades in a vast array of complex products and services. But the sales teams\u2019 performance simply wasn\u2019t up to par, and while one might think the solution would be training or incentives, Sampath focused on a much more foundational element \u2014 pay.\n\nImage courtesy Verizon\n\n\u201cVerizon is one of the few jobs left in America where you can come in with an associate degree and [end up running] some of the largest groups in America; almost every one of our sales leadership team started on the floor,\u201d said Sampath. \u201cBut when you move to group compensation, you don\u2019t create careers anymore, you create a job. It became a self-fulfilling cycle where people were on group comp, they didn\u2019t think that careers could be built, so they weren\u2019t performing well and so the stores weren\u2019t doing well. [As a result corporate decides not] to double down on stores and instead focus on digital.\n\n\u201cWe went back to individual compensation and it started the whole Renaissance [in the consumer business],\u201d he added. \u201cBy saying, \u2018You can build long-term careers in stores,\u2019 the stores started doing really well. [Suddenly then the attitude was] we need more stores.\u201d\n\nMost of the new stores slated to open this year will be under the Total by Verizon banner, which Sampath refers to as Verizon\u2019s \u201cdiffusion\u201d brand. Total by Verizon stores are focused on a lower price point offering, in particular prepaid mobile, to compete with brands like Cricket and T-Mobile\u2018s Metro PCS. Introduced in 2022, Total by Verizon stores now number close to 1,300 and that will nearly double this year, said Sampath. The company also has embarked on a new shop-in-shop trial with Office Depot that is staffed by Verizon employees.\n\nAcross the chain, the result of the compensation shift was not only improved employee satisfaction, but also a productivity bump of 20%. Sampath\u2019s approach to the issue of underperformance reflects a broader, pervasive mindset at Verizon that has come through in conversations with other company executives as well.\n\n\u201cRetail can still create careers,\u201d Sampath said. \u201cThere\u2019s a notion in America that retail is a fleeting job, a job between other jobs. It\u2019s not. At Verizon, one of the things I want to do is create careers for people, long-term, sustainable careers where they can put their kids through school and live a happy, retired life.\u201d\n\nMaking Stores Part of the Community\n\nImage courtesy Verizon\n\nAnother important shift was giving employees and their superiors more control over the experience they offered in their stores. When Sampath took over, the retail operation was run out of Verizon\u2019s Basking Ridge, N.J. headquarters. Sampath broke that up into 55 local territories organized under six regional umbrellas that are each run by their own territory and regional heads.\n\nThe intent was to create tangible localization of Verizon stores across the country. \u201cWe decided that we want to be a local community brand that aggregates to a national brand, as opposed to the other way around,\u201d said Sampath. \u201cIf you close your eyes and someone drops you in most of the national big-box retailers, you would have no idea where in the country you are. Why would I come to a store like that? Unless there\u2019s something personal in the store, either the service or a localized product or a community feel, you can just do it online. If you want people to come to your store, you\u2019re going to have to give them a reason \u2014 great inventory, personalized service, a referral, a sense of community.\u201d\n\nThese localization efforts take many forms, including:\n\nStore managers and reps who know the local residents and get involved in community events ;\n\n; Localized interior design , which can include things like murals from local artists, as in several Miami locations. These localized aesthetics run in tandem with a broader brand refresh rolled out last June;\n\n, which can include things like murals from local artists, as in several Miami locations.

In February the company hosted \u201cFanFests\u201d at 30 NFL stadiums for fans who weren\u2019t able to attend the Super Bowl live (that is, most of us). There was food, drinks, NFL player meet-and-greets, entertainment from local performers and interactive activities like stadium tours.\n\nAnd now Verizon is getting in on the year\u2019s hottest collab \u2014 the third season of HBO Max\u2019s White Lotus \u2014 with themed installations at 300 stores from March 1 through April 4 that feature an immersive AR experience inspired by the show, plus the chance for customers discover their aura colors through a personality quiz.\n\nPrioritizing Personalization over Omnichannel\n\nCounter to many of his retail peers, one thing Sampath isn\u2019t focused on is omnichannel. \u201cI don\u2019t love the word omnichannel, because it feels like a cute way of saying I\u2019m going to sub-optimize both the digital and physical experience,\u201d he explained. \u201cI want the world\u2019s best digital and the world\u2019s best physical experience. If there are two or three points of connection, I will do it, but I\u2019m not going to optimize for it, and that\u2019s what most companies do. There are so many demands on the systems to get to a phenomenal omnichannel experience and [the result is] both experiences get dumbed down. I would rather make some sacrifices in omni to offer the best digital and the best in-store experience.\u201d\n\nImage courtesy Verizon\n\nInstead, Sampath believes the key is that both physical and digital experiences feel personalized to the customer. While Verizon may not try to deeply integrate its store services and digital offerings, it does do things like help customers set up the Verizon app in stores and facilitate offerings like buy online, pick up in-store.\n\nRather than omnichannel, Sampath said he thinks of it more as \u201cblending the boundary\u201d between stores and digital. \u201cStores need to be a personalized experience. When you walk into our store, if I know you\u2019re a customer, I need to talk to you like I know everything about you. And even if you go and look at all the digital displays, that needs to be a logged-in, personalized experience. I also think there\u2019s an opportunity for education at the store \u2014 how to do cyber better, how to use fintech better \u2014 stores are a great place for [those kinds of conversations].\u201d\n\nLeveraging AI to Lighten Employees\u2019 Cognitive Load\n\nLike just about every other company in the world these days, Verizon is looking at ways to take advantage of advances in AI. Currently, those efforts are focused more on employees than customers. \u201cOur feeling is that if we get the employee experience right, they\u2019ll take care of the customer, and we can deploy customer experience AI later,\u201d said Sampath.\n\nIn that regard, the biggest use case Sampath sees for AI is reducing employees\u2019 cognitive overload: \u201cOur frontline teams have way too much shit to remember, and as a result they\u2019re always thinking about the shit they have in their head, versus listening to customers and empathizing with customers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal of AI for us has been reducing that cognitive load.\u201d\n\nThis is being trialed through as many as eight different AI solution deployments, including:\n\nA personal shopper tool for store associates that streamlines information and potential offers based on the associate\u2019s interactions with each customer;\n\nthat streamlines information and potential offers based on the associate\u2019s interactions with each customer; A personal research assistant (PRA) for call center staff that condenses the knowledge from more than 20,000 documents and guides support staff to the specific information they need to solve a customer\u2019s issues; and\n\nthat condenses the knowledge from more than documents and guides support staff to the specific information they need to solve a customer\u2019s issues; and Sentiment analysis on support calls that will identify when things are going south and proactively notify a manager to come help. At the end of calls, call center staff also can view a dashboard giving them performance feedback to help refine their skillset.\n\nAt the end of the day, all of these efforts furnish proof that Verizon is playing the long game: \u201cWe are the largest network by a country mile \u2014 more customers trust us, more governments trust us, more agencies trust us, more small businesses trust us, more large companies trust us, more schools trust us,\u201d Sampath said. \u201cA big part of my mandate is to take all that trust and build on it. We\u2019ve invested $200 billion in America in the last six years. If there\u2019s anyone who can say they\u2019re America first, it\u2019s Verizon.\u201d",

In a post on X, the parent company of Starlink offered little detail about the role it is playing in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rapidly overhaul the nation\u2019s air traffic control system in the wake of the Jan. 29 crash over the Potomac River that killed 67 people.\n\nSpaceX said it is working closely with L3Harris, the prime contractor for the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s current telecommunications system. It said the two companies also are working with the agency to identify instances in which Starlink could serve as a \u201clong-term infrastructure upgrade for aviation safety.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nL3Harris and SpaceX did not respond to questions about the agreement, including when it was signed and how many Starlink kits would be provided. SpaceX said its terminals would serve as \u201cone piece of the of the infrastructure upgrades so badly needed along with fiber, wireless, and other technologies.\u201d\n\nRecent media reports about SpaceX and the FAA are false.\n\n\n\nSpaceX is working in coordination with @L3HarrisTech\u2014the prime contractor for the FAA\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure\u2014 and the @FAANews to test the use of @Starlink as one piece of the infrastructure upgrades so badly\u2026 \u2014 SpaceX (@SpaceX) March 5, 2025\n\nThe new details of SpaceX\u2019s work at the FAA comes after reports surfaced last week that Starlink terminals were being installed at FAA facilities. The reports raised concerns among FAA employees and ethics experts that Musk was using his close relationship with President Donald Trump and his role as head of the U.S. DOGE Service to benefit his companies.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last month that the FAA was close to canceling its 15-year, $2.4 billion agreement with Verizon to upgrade the system in favor of Starlink, citing people who had been briefed on the plan. Elements of the deliberations had previously been reported by the Associated Press and Bloomberg News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRecent media reports about SpaceX and the FAA are false,\u201d SpaceX said in its X post on Wednesday. \u201c\u2026 There is no effort or intent for Starlink to \u2018take over\u2019 any existing contract.\u201d\n\nIn a statement this week, the FAA said that updating the air traffic control system will require \u201cmultiple companies and multiple technologies,\u201d which is why the agency is testing various communications technologies including satellites, fiber and wireless.\n\nThe FAA is testing Starlink at sites in Alaska to see if it will restore stable access to weather information for pilots and its flight safety stations. Starlink also is being tested at FAA facilities in Oklahoma City and Atlantic City, as part of the L3Harris contract. The agency said any final decisions on future deployments will be made by acting FAA administrator Chris Rocheleau.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, a team of SpaceX employees visited several FAA facilities as part of the administration\u2019s efforts to overhaul the agency\u2019s aging technology. Three senior engineers at SpaceX received special waivers last month from the Department of Transportation\u2019s ethics office that allowed them to remain at Musk\u2019s company while serving as special government employees embedded at the FAA. Two of the waivers lasted just four days, while the third, for Ted Malaska, was extended.\n\nConcerns about the technology used to manage the nation\u2019s airspace system have existed for decades but took on new urgency following the Jan. 29 midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River in Washington.\n\nMusk himself fueled speculation that Starlink would play a major role in the effort to modernized FAA\u2019s systems. In a post on his social media platform X last week, he wrote: \u201cTo be clear here, the Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly. The FAA assessment is single digit months to catastrophic failure, putting air traveler safety at serious risk. The Starlink terminals are being sent at NO COST to the taxpayer on an emergency basis to restore air traffic control connectivity. The situation is extremely dire,\u201d only to later post: \u201cCorrection: the ancient system that is rapidly declining in capability was made L3Harris. The new system that is not yet operational is from Verizon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview on Fox News on Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said that while Starlink could be helpful, it would only be one part of a larger plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a solution,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cThere\u2019s some facilities that Starlink can be helpful, but, again, we want to make sure we have fiber-connected systems in place, and so they can play some part of it, but not all of it.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Verizon won a 15-year, $2.4 billion contract to upgrade the platform that different air traffic control facilities and FAA offices use to communicate with one another. But work on the system has moved forward more slowly than anticipated, according to multiple FAA officials.\n\nThe agency was scheduled to make a final decision this month on whether to start paying Verizon for the contract next month, said one, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Verizon did not respond to a request for comment. But at an event hosted by Barclays Bank last month, Joseph Russo, an executive vice president at the company, said Starlink\u2019s efforts at FAA might be complementary to Verizon\u2019s. Verizon, he said, was offering the \u201creliability and performance\u201d that the FAA needed, and its system was expected to be operational soon.",

Inferencing is becoming more commonplace, which is driving a transition to a more distributed computing environment where traffic moves device-to-device and edge-to-core-to-cloud, Lawrence said.\n\nAI-driven network topology changes are the subject of our free report, published this week, \"Redefining Connectivity for AI-Driven Enterprises: The unexpected evolution of SD-WAN.\" We talked with experts at VeloCloud by Broadcom, Walmart, Nature Fresh Farms, AT&T, and Orange Business.\n\nIn another free report, we explored how network topologies need to adapt to keep expensive GPUs fed with data: \"AI and the Network: Optimizing Network Design and Operations to Meet AI Demands.\"\n\nVerizon's AI Connect strategy and services, launched in January, are designed to serve that networking demand, Lawrence said.\n\nBuilding on strengths\n\nAI Connect is built on Verizon's key assets across the U.S., with space, power and cooling to help expand edge computing, based on edge services launched five years ago, Lawrence said.\n\nVerizon also leverages its fiber assets across 71 major metropolitan U.S. cities, supporting dark fiber and lit wave fiber services. Verizon is rolling out 400 gigabit wave services this year, with 800 gigabit to follow shortly, and it tested 1.6 terabyte service in November.\n\nPart of Verizon's strategy is serving the GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) market, Lawrence said. \"Many of [these providers] are infrastructure-disadvantaged because they haven't had time to build up their fiber networks like the hyperscalers.\" Verizon is partnering with Vultr to provide data center space, power, cooling and fiber networking facilities \"to extend and connect their existing footprint of data centers,\" he said.\n\nPlatforms like Vultr have recently been dubbed \"neocloud providers.\" Last week, Juniper launched a solution purpose built for this market.\n\nVerizon is not alone in seeing and anticipating networking demand driven by AI. Long-haul and middle-mile players such as Lumen, Zayo and Windstream are investing in networking capacity to meet demand. Zayo plans to build 5,000 miles of long-haul fiber. Flexential CEO Chris Downie warned that network could be the cloud's next coveted resource.\n\nWhat enterprises want\n\nVerizon's enterprise customers want to invest in AI prudently, avoiding \"getting caught up in the hype\" and implementing \"a solution that's looking for a problem,\" Daniel Lawson, Verizon Business SVP global solutions, said. They seek solutions to improve operations, change the customer experience and differentiate from competition.\n\nFor example, one big box retailer has a GPU in every store, using it to monitor shrinkage and other applications, including automated cashless checkout, Lawson said. He didn't name the retailer, but his description is very similar to technology discussed by Walmart in Fierce's report on redefining network connectivity. Another enterprise is looking to build applications to help train 15-30 new regional suppliers annually.\n\nEarly enterprise AI adopters tend to be \"on the larger side,\" Lawson said, and in \"asset-heavy industries\" such as manufacturing, logistics, supply chain and healthcare, with enormous volumes of valuable data at the edge. These enterprises value new enterprise network architectures to bring \"the model to the data instead of trying to bring the data to the model,\" he said.\n\nEnterprises demand convergence. They don't care if connectivity is wireline or wireless; they just want it to work, and offer the same kinds of SLAs on wireless as on wireline, Lawrence said.\n\nAlso, enterprises want to lay the foundation for future applications without building ahead of demand.\n\n\"They're not wanting to build the church for Easter, so to speak,\" Lawrence said.\n\nThey want to have capacity available to move quickly and efficiently to solve problems without getting too far ahead of need.\n\nDifferent lenses\n\nVerizon views AI through different. The first is \"applied AI,\" which enhances customer and employee experience and drives operational efficiencies. Verizon is applying generative AI and AIops to its own business and has been using AI for \"well over a decade,\" resulting in \"significant operational and overall experience improvements\" by deploying AI and generative AI.\n\nVerizon has deployed Fast Pass, a contact center solution using Google Cloud services across 30,000 agents, resulting in significant call time reduction and improved customer satisfaction, Lawrence said.\n\nAnother lens is \"embedded AI,\" where AIops and generative AI are integrated into existing and new products and services.\n\nVerizon plans to launch Verizon Digital Assistant for the small and medium business market this month. This assistant integrates conversational AI into SMS texting so customers can ask for information on business hours, venues and other such information.\n\nAdditionally, AI is embedded in devices Verizon sells from Apple and Samsung.",

Fortunately, Verizon is running a promo that knocks the price of the super-powered Galaxy S25 Ultra down to just $5 per month when you add a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan. No trade-in is required, and you can get the phone as soon as today if you have a local Verizon store.\n\nThe catch is that Unlimited Ultimate is Verizon's most expensive wireless option, but if you've been eyeing the data plan anyway, now's your chance to pair it with one of the best Android phones on the market today.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 256GB: $1,299.99 $5 per month with Unlimited Ultimate at Verizon Pair the purchase of a Galaxy S25 Ultra with a new line on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and Verizon will hook you up with $1,119.99 over 36 months, knocking the price of the premium phone down to just $5 per month. No trade-in required!\n\n\u2705Recommended if: you want a powerful smartphone with a ton of AI features, a huge display, and seven years of OS/security updates; you're a Verizon customer or willing to switch; you're down to sign up for one of the industry's best wireless plans.\n\n\u274cSkip this deal if: you're looking for a trade-in deal or an unlocked phone; you're happy with your current wireless setup; one of the other Galaxy S25 deals out there works better for you.\n\nEasily one of the most powerful phones on the market today, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra boasts a stunning 6.9-inch AMOLED 120Hz display with seven years of guaranteed OS updates, all of the latest Galaxy AI software features, and the unrivalled efficiency of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The camera system is also quite versatile, and like past Ultra phones, you get the convenience of an S Pen stylus embedded directly into the device.\n\nThe Unlimited Ultimate plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network, plus you get 60GB of mobile hotspot data every month, unlimited international coverage in over 210 countries worldwide, and a free Apple One subscription.\n\nStarting at $90 per month for one line, Verizon's best data plan isn't exactly cheap, but you can lower the cost considerably by adding multi-line discounts and signing up for AutoPay. If you want a new phone but the Unlimited Ultimate plan won't work with your situation, fear not: there are a ton of other Verizon deals that are a bit easier to swallow, from trade-in discounts to plan options that you can customize yourself. Verizon's offers typically come with a lot of fine print, but with a bit of planning, you could be enjoying some superbly-optimized (and budget-friendly) wireless in no time.",

The current, aging, network was created and is maintained by defense contractor L3Harris Technologies (LHX+0.12% ).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk last month claimed that the current system used by air traffic controllers is \u201cbreaking down very rapidly\u201d with \u201csingle digit months to catastrophic failure.\u201d At the time, he also promoted SpaceX\u2019s Starlink subsidiary as an alternative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpaceX said Wednesday that it is working with L3Harris and the FAA to test the implementation of Starlink\u2019s satellite internet terminals to help upgrade the system. The Hawthorne, California-based company said it signed a loan agreement with L3Harris to provide Starlink kits and service \u201cfree of charge for an initial testing period.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome 4,000 Starlink terminals were sent to the FAA last month to hasten an upgrade at the FAA. Terminals have been installed at the FAA\u2019s air traffic control technology hub in New Jersey, as well as a facility in Oklahoma City, while a terminal went online at Birchwood Airport in Alaska last month, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nBoth Bloomberg and The Washington Post reported that FAA officials were deciding whether to cancel Verizon\u2019s contract entirely. SpaceX says that won\u2019t be happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStarlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system,\u201d SpaceX said in a statement posted to Musk\u2019s X. \u201cThere is no effort or intent for Starlink to \u2018take over\u2019 any existing contract.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, members of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d had discussed using Starlink to modernize the FAA\u2019s systems during his transition to the White House. Then, just days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, a catastrophic plane crash killed 67 passengers and crew members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing that event, and several others, Transportation Department Secretary Sean Duffy said improving the U.S. air traffic control system is a priority. As part of that effort, he brought on SpaceX engineers to give advice and discuss modernizing the system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the solution,\u201d Duffy told Fox News on Tuesday, emphasizing that Starlink\u2019s terminals are ideal for areas where it\u2019s difficult to install fiber wires, such as mountains in Alaska.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVerizon seems to agree. Executive Vice President Joe Russo recently said its planned network \u2014 which he said will be operational \u201cshortly\u201d \u2014 could work with Starlink.\n\n\u201cAll I know is if they are testing ... I think that can be complementary to what we\u2019re trying to build to really run the FAA infrastructure,\u201d he said on Feb. 25 at a conference.",

(NYSE:VZ) stands against the other undervalued stocks.\n\nHow Will Tariffs Affect the Market?\n\nOn March 5th, BBC reported that the US stock market had fallen after the tariffs sparked trade war fear. The recent imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China has sparked significant concerns about a potential trade war. The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on most imports from these countries, with Canadian energy products facing a 10% tariff. On the other hand, tariffs on Chinese imports have been increased from 10% to 20%. As a result, Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau announced immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of US goods, with plans for additional tariffs on $125 billion in goods over the next three weeks. Moreover, China imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 15% on various US agricultural imports, such as chicken, pork, and soybeans. The tariffs have raised fears of inflation and a broader trade conflict, leading to a decline in US and global stock markets. As a result, the S&P 500 experienced a significant drop, and European markets also closed lower.\n\nToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\n\nWhile talking about how the Fed might react to the tariffs, Fisher mentioned that it is a little too early to guess. The Fed is bringing inflation down and we are getting closer to the 2% target, however, at the same time tariff increases the cost of doing business, which might slow down the economy and tickle up inflation. To conclude Fisher noted that tariffs won\u2019t be digested quickly and will take time.",

Beyond that, a plan can also offer perks and features that are relevant to you, whether it's a discount for a streaming service, multi-line discounts, a discounted separate plan for a connected device, or international features. But remember, the ideal plan becomes useless if its carrier doesn't cover your area well.\n\nAfter extensively testing and researching options from major carriers and budget-friendly providers, we've concluded that Verizon's Unlimited Plus plan is the best cell phone plan overall. It offers the most data with the widest-reaching coverage at an unmatched value, especially with more lines on a plan. The top budget option we recommend among major carriers is T-Mobile's Essentials plan, which includes a generous amount of premium data for a lower monthly bill that will net significant long-term savings.\n\nOur top picks for the best cell phone plans\n\nBest overall: Verizon Unlimited Plus Plan - See at Verizon\n\nBest budget: T-Mobile Essentials Plan - See at T-Mobile\n\nBest true budget: Mint Mobile Introductory 3-Month Plans - See at Mint Mobile\n\nBest international: Verizon Unlimited Ultimate Plan - See at Verizon\n\nBest overall\n\nVerizon Unlimited Plus Plan Verizon\u2019s Unlimited Plus plan offers unlimited \u201cpremium data,\u201d so you don\u2019t have to worry about data caps or slower speeds when the network is congested. Other carriers also offer this in some of their plans, but Verizon has the best overall coverage, includes excellent perks, and it\u2019s not even the most expensive option.

Though a single line costs $70/month (with auto-pay and paper-free billing enabled), the monthly cost per line is less with every additional line, up to four lines.\n\nWith Verizon's Unlimited Plus plan, you get unlimited high-end prioritized data, so your data speeds won't slow down after you've used a certain amount of monthly data when the network is congested. It also includes Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network, which runs on the super fast mmWave and C-band spectrums. Verizon also offers a 50% discount for a single connected device plan, whether for a connected smartwatch or tablet.\n\nVerizon's Unlimited Plus plan is the most comprehensive and versatile option that offers good value, especially for accounts with more lines. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nIn addition to its core wireless services, Verizon's Unlimited Plus plan includes discounts on various other services. Among the deals, you can save $12/month on a Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus bundle or $7/month on a Netflix and Max bundle. Check out Verizon's website for the other available perks.\n\nAs for international use, the Unlimited Plus plan gets you unlimited talk and text and 2GB of daily high-speed data (before it's slowed to 3G speeds) in Mexico and Canada. It also allows unlimited talk and text from the US to Mexico and Canada and unlimited texting to over 200 countries.\n\nVerizon says video streaming quality on the Unlimited Ultimate plan is limited to 720p, but their fine print says 4K quality is available in 5G Ultra Wideband areas when you activate the 4K streaming option through the My Verizon app or with Verizon's customer service. It also says 1080p resolution can be activated in standard 5G and 4G areas.\n\nVerizon Fios internet users who also use Verizon Wireless will also get a discount on their internet service, so it's an especially good choice for Verizon Fios customers.\n\nNo other carrier offers as much for the price, and importantly, Verizon generally has the best-mixed coverage between rural and urban areas.\n\nBest budget plan\n\nT-Mobile Essentials Plan T-Mobile\u2019s Essentials plan is the most affordable premium plan among the major carriers. It\u2019s a downright bargain with four or five lines on a single plan and includes 50GB of premium monthly data per line before T-Mobile slows down your data speeds. Just note that Essentials users may experience slower speeds than higher-paying T-Mobile customers during network congestion. Check price at T-Mobile What we like Check mark icon A check mark.

That means data won't become deprioritized until you've used 50GB of data, even when the network is busy. Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon don't offer any premium data in their equivalent plans of the same price range.\n\nT-Mobile's Essentials plan offers excellent value for a substantial allotment of premium monthly data. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nT-Mobile's Essentials plan starts at $60/month for a single line, with the price per line reducing with every additional line. The Essentials plan supports up to six lines; if you can manage four or more lines, it's a steal. Those who only need up to three lines should opt for T-Mobile's Essentials Saver plan. It's identical to the standard Essentials plan, but pricing is more favorable ($10 less per line) for single and dual-line accounts.\n\nT-Mobile's Essentials plan provides access to the carrier's full and extensive 5G network, including its Ultra Capacity 5G network (mmWave and C-band) and its Extended Range 5G (Sub-6). Despite the comprehensive network coverage, it's worth noting that data speeds for Essentials customers may be slower overall than those of other customers on more expensive plans, even when using premium prioritized data. Still, data speeds should be fast enough for pretty much anything you do on your phone.\n\nT-Mobile offers unlimited mobile hot spot functionality on its Essentials plan, but only at 3G speeds. It limits you to basic tasks, like emailing, but 3G speeds might be dubiously slow scrolling down photo and video-heavy social media apps or video streaming. If you're looking for at least some flexibility to use your phone as a mobile hot spot, AT&T's Unlimited Starter plan will be the better option. It has 5GB of mobile hot spot data at faster speeds, which can better serve you for light use or in an emergency.\n\nFinally, T-Mobile offers some international perks with its Essentials plan. You get unlimited texting, $0.25/minute calls in 215+ countries, and unlimited international texting from home. In Canada and Mexico, Essentials offers unlimited talk and text but up to 128Kbps data speeds, which is so slow you may even struggle with an email. T-Mobile Travel is also included.\n\nBest true budget plan\n\nMint Mobile (Introductory 3-Month Plans) All of Mint Mobile's three-month plans are discounted for new customers. Starting at just $15/month, you can get discounted rates on plans from 5GB up to unlimited monthly data and gain access to T-Mobile's network for unlimited calls and texts from our favorite MVNO.

No discounts for additional lines\n\nA so-called \"true budget\" cell phone plan typically comes from mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which deliver data and connectivity to your phone by piggybacking on a major carrier's network. Worthwhile plans from these providers offer data at notably lower monthly prices than the least expensive flagship plan from a major carrier, the $50/month T-Mobile Essentials Saver plan.\n\nMint Mobile's introductory three-month plans are the best \"true budget\" option for new customers and our top pick among the best cheap cell phone plans. The promotion offers three-month prepaid plans with 5GB, 15GB, 20GB, or unlimited monthly data for discounted rates, starting at just $15/month. However, each plan's data is subject to deprioritization behind T-Mobile customers during network congestion.\n\nMint Mobile is an exceptional MVNO option if T-Mobile adequately covers you. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nThose who have already tried and valued Mint Mobile should opt for the carrier's 12-month plans, which offer the best value at the same rates as the introductory three-month promotion.\n\nAs we note in our Mint Mobile review, the service stands out from the competition in the MVNO market for its long-term value and straightforward app, customer service, and plan management. Mint Mobile is also considerably more affordable than the least expensive plans from its parent company, T-Mobile. See our guide to Mint Mobile vs. T-Mobile for further comparison.\n\nFor even cheaper access to T-Mobile's network, you might consider Tello Mobile, which offers customizable plans for limited data and minutes for as low as $5/month. Read our Tello Mobile review and Mint Mobile vs. Tello guide to help decide between the two MVNOs.\n\nHowever, if you know that T-Mobile's coverage may not sufficiently cover your area, or if you're looking for high-speed data not subject to deprioritization, you may be better served by Verizon's network, as we detail in our guide to Mint Mobile vs. Verizon. Relative to Mint Mobile and Tello, slightly more expensive MVNO options run on Verizon's network with allotted prioritized data.\n\nThese Verizon-backed options include the Visible Plus unlimited plan from Visible Wireless, which guarantees 50GB of premium data at $45/month (or $35/month with a limited-time promotion). There's also the Unlimited Starter plan from US Mobile at $25/month, which gives you 35GB of prioritized high-speed data on Verizon's network and offers the unique ability to switch from Verizon to T-Mobile's or AT&T's networks within the same low-cost service. See our Visible Wireless review or US Mobile review for more information.\n\nBest international plan\n\nVerizon Unlimited Ultimate Plan Verizon\u2019s Unlimited Ultimate plan has the most comprehensive international features without the need to purchase a separate international plan. It\u2019s ideal if you frequently communicate internationally, whether from the US or abroad. Check price at Verizon What we like Check mark icon A check mark.

It slightly outperforms T-Mobile's Go5G Next and Plus plans. Most AT&T plans don't include international features and require additional $10/day plans for some of the same international features included in Verizon's and T-Mobile's plans.\n\nMost major carriers (except AT&T) support unlimited talk, text, and a set amount of data while traveling in more than 210 countries in their plans. Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan offers more monthly data (10GB) than T-Mobile (5GB). AT&T only offers access in 20 Latin American countries if you don't add a supplemental international plan.\n\nVerizon's Unlimited Ultimate plans also include 300 minutes/month of calling time from the US to a country of choice from 140 countries. Verizon charges a country-specific rate for all other countries. AT&T and T-Mobile charge a country-specific rate when calling any country from the US and don't have the free 300-minute calling option on Verizon's plan.\n\nAll three major carriers support unlimited calling and texting to Mexico and Canada from the US. If you're in Mexico or Canada, AT&T's plans actually offer the most with unlimited talk, text, and the same amount of data as your domestic US plan. Verizon and T-Mobile also offer unlimited talk and text in Mexico and Canada, but Verizon has a 2GB/day data limit, and T-Mobile has a 15GB/month data limit.\n\nIf you rarely or just occasionally travel or communicate internationally and don't need pricey plans that include international features, you could simply add an international add-on plan to a more affordable plan. These usually range from $5 to $10 per day, which seems pricey in the short term, but they're likely cheaper in the long run, at least for those who don't need international features as often.\n\nHow we test cell phone plans\n\nWe've tested every major carrier and various MVNOs against standard criteria. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nOur testing procedure for cell phone plans involves day-to-day personal use, like making calls, sending messages, and using data-light and data-heavy apps, from browsing the web to streaming videos and scrolling through content-rich social media apps. We also test data speeds in various locations on different networks, including LTE, basic 5G, and high-band 5G. For data speed testing, we also conduct our tests in varying signal strengths.\n\nWe have extensive experience with every major carrier in personal use and testing scenarios to assess data speeds and coverage, and we compare our results to the carrier's claims. Coverage and data speeds differ significantly in different locations, so we can't accurately claim that one network is better for specific areas. However, based on our experience with the major carriers in rural, suburban, and urban areas, we are confident in making a general assessment.\n\nAfter assessing a carrier's overall quality based on coverage and data speeds, we look at a plan's offerings and monthly price. These criteria include data amount, whether premium-prioritized data is used or subject to deprioritization, what happens after reaching a data limit, mobile hot spot features, whether a plan includes fast high-band 5G connectivity, multi-line discounts, international features, and extra benefits or perks.\n\nWe've also tested various MVNO and budget-friendly carriers but haven't tested them all. Having tested all major carriers, we generally know how MVNOs and budget-friendly carriers perform in terms of coverage and data speeds as they operate on major carrier networks. See our best cheap cell phone plans guide for other top options from our testing in the MVNO landscape.\n\nWhat to look for in a cell phone plan\n\nWe look for prioritized data in the best cell phone plans, assuring top-tier speeds without disruption. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe perfect cell phone plan doesn't make sense if a carrier has inadequate network coverage in your area. First, you should narrow your options by determining which carrier has the best coverage in whichever locations you frequent. One way to do so is by asking neighbors and locals in person or on social media like Nextdoor.\n\nAfter you've figured out which carriers have the network coverage you need, the core plan feature to look for is sufficient data for your needs, allowing a worry-free experience when using your phone without WiFi, especially when scrolling through data-heavy social media apps, streaming video, or video calling.\n\nWe prefer plans that offer you the most \"premium data'' with no data limits before a carrier slows down your speeds. We also like plans where your data isn't affected when a carrier's network is congested. That way, you can do whatever you want on your phone without thinking about the time of day, like rush hours.\n\nAfter that, it's a question of your monthly budget. Pricier plans offer unlimited premium data, but you may have to settle for a plan with limited premium data if your budget doesn't allow it. One way to reduce your monthly bill is to join a plan with friends and family, as the monthly cost per line gets lower as more people are on a plan. See our guide to the best family cell phone plans for the top options from our testing.\n\nThe following plan features are more subjective.\n\nIf you often work on your laptop away from a familiar or secure WiFi connection and use your phone as a mobile hot spot, you'll want a plan that offers as much mobile hot spot data as you need. If this feature is incredibly important to you, it could dictate which plan you get.\n\nIf you often travel or communicate with friends and family abroad, you'll want to consider a plan's international features. Alternatively, carriers offer international add-on plans at an extra cost on top of your usual monthly bill. You can apply these as needed.\n\nPerks are nice add-ons that could tip you toward a specific carrier as long as that carrier has good coverage in your area. Things like discounts on streaming service bundles, your home internet service, or discounts on separate plans for data-connected smartwatches or tablets could make the difference.",

Verizon stock still attracts income-oriented investors, thanks to its dividend. But a growth story has been lacking for VZ stock.\n\nAmid top management changes, the company is focusing on generating growth in wireless service revenue, free cash flow and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nFurther, VZ stock has advanced about 10% in 2025. Shares in AT&T have gained 22% while T-Mobile is up about 24%\n\nInvestors in AT&T stock are bullish on \"convergence\" \u2014 selling landline broadband and wireless services in product bundles.\n\nFrontier Acquisition On Track\n\nIn September, Verizon agreed to buy Frontier Communications (FYBR) for $20 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in early 2026.\n\nFrontier is the largest pure play fiber provider in the U.S. with 10 million home passed expected by the end of 2026. The company has 2.2 million fiber network subscribers currently across 25 states.\n\nWhat's more, Verizon has increased its fixed wireless access subscriber goal to 8 million to 9 million by the end of 2028. That's up from 4 million to 5 million 5G fixed broadband customers by the end of 2025.\n\nVerizon Stock Fundamentals\n\nRising interest rates and Treasury bill yields have been a headwind for dividend-paying stocks. Further, a Verizon stock buyback has been delayed by purchases of radio spectrum needed for 5G wireless services.\n\nNew York-based Verizon may be in a tough position as wireless industry growth slows amid competition with AT&T and T-Mobile as well as cable TV companies. The Verizon brand also has lost some oomph as the company fights to regain its marketing claim to operating the highest quality wireless network.\n\nHowever, it's taking much longer than expected for 5G synergies to kick in. Verizon owns mid-band and high-frequency millimeter wave radio spectrum.\n\nVerizon's consumer wireless business has yet to get a material revenue lift from 5G smartphone users. Also, revenue from 5G business services using private networks has disappointed.\n\nVZ Stock: No 5G Boost\n\nOverall, revenue growth remains an issue. Data-gobbling mobile video hasn't panned out as a big moneymaker. Verizon has focused on upgrading consumers to unlimited data plans to boost average monthly revenue per user.\n\nVerizon expects 5G business services using private network links to gain momentum in 2025. Also, it's investing in \"mobile-edge compute\" sites.\n\nVerizon has partnered with Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon (AMZN) to develop 5G apps for the web-connected industrial devices. Another partner is IBM (IBM).\n\nWhat's more, pundits expect 5G wireless to have a role in manufacturing automation, cloud gaming, autonomous vehicles, drones and remote health care services.\n\nVerizon Stock: Is It A Buy Right Now?\n\nWhether Verizon stock is a buy depends on fundamental and technical factors as well as each investor's own goals, strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nVerizon holds an entry point of 44.73 from a double-bottom base. The double-bottom base looks sort of like the letter W. It features two distinct sell-offs.\n\nIn addition, Verizon stock holds a Relative Strength Rating of only 73 out of a best-possible 99, according to the IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have RS ratings of 80 or better.\n\nIn addition, VZ stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 73 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. It's a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nMeanwhile, Verizon stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-plus. This rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.\n\nAs of March 4, Verizon stock trades just below its 44.73 entry point. Amid volatility in technology stocks, some investors might view Verizon as a defensive play.\n\nFurther, check out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to find dozens more of the best stocks to buy or watch.\n\nAlso, investors can sign up for email alerts on earnings and other news from Verizon investor relations.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on 5G wireless, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nHow To Use The 10-Week Moving Average For Buying And Selling\n\nGet Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report | How To Invest\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis",

That blue color for the 3a also looks quite fabulous in these pictures.\n\nNothing Phone (3a) and (3a) Pro Specs: In terms of specs, Nothing has chosen to power each phone with the newish Qualcomm Snapdragon 7S Gen 3. This is an upper-tier mid-range chipset that should be able to handle almost anything you can throw at it. During testing, I can confirm that in most use cases, this chip was more than enough. The only times I noticed sluggishness or stuttering was during a first boot of Pokemon Go, a notoriously poorly optimized game. Once I let it run a bit, it typically smoothed out. Everything else was great.\n\nWe also get 12GB RAM and 256GB storage in each, large 5000mAh batteries with 50W wired charging (no wireless charging), large 6.77\u2033 AMOLED displays with 120Hz refresh rates, in-display fingerprint readers (that are quite quick), WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, and triple rear cameras. The big differences, as I mentioned earlier, are through the 50MP periscope telephoto lens as well as a 50MP selfie camera in the Pro model. They also have different main 50MP sensors. Overall, the takeaway there is that the 3a Pro is a higher-end camera system, which is why you are paying more.\n\nPhone (3a) Phone (3a) Pro Price $379 $459 OS NothingOS 3.1\n\nAndroid 15 NothingOS 3.1\n\nAndroid 15 Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 Display 6.77\" AMOLED, 120Hz, 1080p\n\n3000 nits peak brightness\n\nGorilla Glass 5 6.77\" AMOLED, 120Hz, 1080p\n\n3000 nits peak brightness\n\nGorilla Glass 5 Memory 12GB RAM\n\n256GB storage 12GB RAM\n\n256GB storage Battery 5000mAh\n\n50W wired charging 5000mAh\n\n50W wired charging Rear Cameras Main: 50 MP (Samsung GN9 - DL), F1.88, 1/1.56\"\n\n\n\nTelephoto: 50 MP Telescope Lens (Samsung JN5)\n\n\n\nUltrawide: 8 MP (Sony IMX355), 120.2\u00b0 FOV Main: 50 MP (Samsung GNJ), F1.88, 1/1.56\n\n\n\nTelephoto: 50 MP Periscope Lens (Sony LTY-600)\n\n\n\nUltrawide: 8 MP (Sony IMX355), 120.2\u00b0 FOV Front Camera 32 MP (Samsung KD1)\n\n\n\n50 MP (Samsung JN1) Connectivity WiFi 6\n\nBluetooth 5.4\n\nNFC WiFi 6\n\nBluetooth 5.4\n\nNFC Other USB-C, IP64, In-display fingerprint, Stereo speakers USB-C, IP64, In-display fingerprint, Stereo speakers Size 163.52mm x 77.50mm x 8.35 mm\n\n201g 163.52mm x 77.50mm x 8.90 mm\n\n211g Colors Black/White Grey/Black\n\nEach phone runs NothingOS 3.1 and Android 15 out of the box. Nothing is doing Android the way it is supposed to be done, by not screwing up the basics (like the way notifications are handled) and yet finding ways to improve upon Google\u2019s base builds. Nothing has a tremendous set of widgets to help you customize your home screen (and lock screen), an icon theming app that does all of your apps, super quick animations, lovely sounds, quick search in the app drawer, and even some \u201cSpecial\u201d features like AirPods support.\n\nAs far as updates go, Nothing says these phones will see updates for \u201c6 years starting from when the device first became available on nothing.tech.\u201d The level of updates includes \u201cthree years of Android updates and six years of security updates in addition to corrective and functionality updates.\u201d\n\nI mentioned the Essential Space earlier, so let\u2019s dive back into that. Nothing has created this area as an AI-powered hub of sorts. You add to it by clicking this new dedicated button on the right side of the phone that sits just under the power button. You can click it whenever you want to take a screenshot of whatever you are looking at, which you can then add notes to either by voice or typing. You can also hold-in this new button to record audio at any moment, with reminders or notes about life. You can even open the camera, point it at something, and then hold that button in to keep track of stuff through your lens. This all gets added to the Essential Space, which tries to organize everything you\u2019ve saved. You can create projects to keep track of, wait for the Space to turn your audio notes into actionable things like reminders, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s early enough in this Essential Space idea that we have no clue if it\u2019s awesome or meh, but I certainly like the idea of just pressing a button to get a phone to help me better maintain my life\u2019s daily grind. I\u2019m really looking forward to trying it out further.\n\nAnd now onto the unfortunate part. Nothing is launching these phones in the US under their \u201cUS Beta Program.\u201d All that means in reality is that you are buying a phone in the US that may or may not work that well with US carriers. We asked Nothing for some clarity, and they told us that both phones should work well with AT&T and T-Mobile, but that Verizon support could be a bit finicky. They also mentioned that you would need to contact their support to get whitelisted for 5G access on AT&T and Verizon. What a pain.\n\nBelow, we have all of the supported bands:\n\nAT&T : LTE Bands: 2/4/12/17/5/48/66 5G Bands: 2/5/66/77\n\n: T-Mobile : LTE Bands: 2/4/5/12/41/48/66 5G Bands: 41/77\n\n: Verizon : LTE Bands: 2/4/5/48/66 5G Bands: 2/5/66/77 CDMA is not supported.\n\n:\n\nSo let\u2019s say you have read everything and decide to buy one of these devices because the price is great, as is the design and set of features, when can you do that? The Nothing Phone 3a is up for purchase today (March 4) with shipping happening around March 11. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro goes up for order on March 11 and should start arriving around March 25.\n\nPhone (3a) : 12GB RAM + 256GB storage, Black/White \u2013 $379 Availability \u2013 Phone (3a) : Available to order from March 4, with deliveries starting March 11.\n\n: 12GB RAM + 256GB storage, Black/White \u2013 $379 Phone (3a) Pro : 12GB RAM + 256GB storage, Grey/Black \u2013 $459 Availability \u2013 Phone (3a) Pro : Available to order from March 11, with deliveries starting March 25.\n\n: 12GB RAM + 256GB storage, Grey/Black \u2013 $459\n\nWe may have quick reviews in the coming days/weeks as we continue to test. It really is too bad about this limited US launch, though \u2013 these phones sure seem pretty great out of the box and for this price.\n\n// Nothing",

Bloomberg News, which first reported the FAA\u2019s use of Starlink, said the agency will deploy a network of 4,000 terminals over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe Associated Press reported the agreement between the FAA and Starlink as a \u201ctakeover\u201d of Verizon\u2019s $2 billion contract to modernize the agency\u2019s communications system. The 15-year deal was signed in 2023, and about $200 million has been spent on that project so far.\n\nMusk on Monday in a post on X said Verizon\u2019s system is \u201cnot working\u201d and \u201cputting air travelers at serious risk,\u201d without providing evidence.\n\n\u201cWe're at the beginning of a 15-year contract with the FAA that will help the agency modernize its technology,\u201d Verizon spokesman Rich Young said in a statement shared with FLYING. \u201cProtecting Americans who rely on a safe, secure, and functioning air traffic control system is more important than ever, and our enhancements will help make that happen.\u201d\n\nA Verizon representative told the AP the company had no knowledge of its contract being modified or cancelled. Former FAA officials, meanwhile, told the media outlet they had worries about using Starlink without proper vetting.\n\nStarlink\u2019s relationship with the FAA also raises concerns about a conflict of interest. The White House has identified Musk, the owner of Starlink and its parent company SpaceX, as a senior adviser to President Donald Trump. But that assertion is at odds with previous statements and some of Trump\u2019s own words indicating Musk\u2019s involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nTrump has tasked DOGE, created via executive order, with cutting federal spending, and it has already canceled contracts at other agencies.\n\nAccording to the AP, at least three SpaceX acolytes, including Ted Malaska, whose LinkedIn profile lists him as SpaceX\u2019s senior director of application software, have received \u201cethics waivers\u201d\u2014awarded in rare circumstances to allow work that benefits the recipient\u2019s company\u2014from the Trump administration.\n\nMalaska last week posted a photo of himself with representatives from the FAA and National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), which represents about 20,000 aviation safety personnel. NATCA has pushed back on some of the Trump administration\u2019s proposed changes to the ATC system in the wake of January\u2019s fatal midair collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk and commercial passenger jet, which killed 67 people.\n\n\u201cWorking to improve the safety of the national air space system,\u201d Malaska wrote on X.",

            "content": "Choosing a new cell carrier is a big decision, as it typically means you'll have to sign a multiyear contract. There are several factors you'll want to consider, including the coverage in your area and how much data you typically use. However, it's also worth looking at what deals are being offered, as they can often save you quite a bit and may sway your decision one way or the other. If you're considering choosing Verizon, there are tons of phone discounts on the latest and greatest iPhone 16, Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 devices with a new line or trade-in, plus some service plan discounts that can help knock a a few bucks off your monthly service bill.\n\nTo help you take full advantage of these carrier offers, we've outlined some of the best deals and how the savings work below. Verizon offers deals year-round, but the details change frequently. We'll keep this page updated with the latest bargains, so be sure to check back whenever you're looking to upgrade or switch from another carrier.\n\nBest Verizon phone deals\n\nVerizon routinely offers substantial savings on phones, but it's important to note that the majority of these discounts are applied as credits over a period of 36 months. This means you'll need to remain a Verizon customer for at least three years to pay off your phone. You'll be responsible for any remaining charges if you cancel before that period ends.\n\nApple iPhone 16 series Verizon is offering hundreds off all iPhone 16 models right now -- including the new budget-friendly iPhone 16E. Adding a new line on an Unlimited Ultimate plan will score you the basic iPhone 16, 16 Plus or 16 Pro for free, or knock $1,020 off the 16 Pro Max, which drops the price down to just $5 per month. If you'd rather be on a more affordable myPlan line, you can still grab the iPhone 16, 16 Plus or 16 Pro for free or save up to $1,000 the 16 Pro Max when both trading in an eligible device and activating a new line of service. If you're after the more affordable iPhone 16E, a new line on any plan will save you $420, which knocks the price down to just $5 per month. You can also get it for free with both a new unlimited line and an eligible trade-in. All discounts are applied as bill credits over 36 months. Details Save up to $1,020 with new line See at Verizon Close\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series Samsung's brand-new Galaxy S25 series is available now, and Verizon is offering savings on all three models. Adding a new line on an Unlimited Plus or Ultimate plan knocks $800 off the basic Galaxy S25, which puts the 128GB model in you're pocket for free. A new Unlimited Ultimate line will also get you the step-up Galaxy S25 Plus for free and knock $1,120 off the S25 Ultra, which drops the price down to just $5 per month. If you're trading in an old phone and activating a new myPlan line, you can save up to $1,000 -- scoring you the basic S25 and S25 Plus for free or the S25 Ultra for as little as $8 per month. You can also get a free Galaxy Watch 7 or a Galaxy Tab S9 FE 5G when bundled with the purchase, but you'll need a new line and an unlimited plan for these devices. Details Save up to $1,120 with new line See at Verizon Close\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Though the next-gen models just hit shelves, last year's Galaxy S24 is still an excellent Android, and you can snag it for free right now. To get the deal, you'll need to activate a new line of service on an Unlimited Ultimate plan, with no trade-in required. The more affordable Galaxy S24 FE is also available for free with a new line on an Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate plan. Currently, there aren't any special offers on the Galaxy S24 Plus or Ultra. Details Free with new line See at Verizon Close\n\nGoogle Pixel 9 series Verizon is offering savings on all four models in Google's latest and greatest Pixel 9 lineup. If you're only after the basic Pixel 9, you can get it for free with a new line on an Unlimited Plus or Ultimate plan. A new line on an Unlimited Ultimate plan will score you the Pixel 9 Pro for free or knock $1,020 off the 9 Pro XL, which drops the price down to just $5 per month. Or, you can save up to $1,000 with both a new line and a trade-in, which scores you the basic Pixel 9 and 9 Pro for free, the 9 Pro XL for $6 per month and the 9 Pro Fold for $22 a month. Plus, you can bundle this purchase with a free Pixel Watch 2 or Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 5G, but you'll need to activate a new line for these devices. Details Save up to $1,020 off with new line See at Google Close\n\nBest Verizon plan deals\n\n\n\nIf you're looking to switch to Verizon, there are a few deals on various plans that may make you lean toward one or the other. Promotions on plans are less common these days, though oftentimes you can get some free extras such as free streaming-service and music subscriptions with enrollment in some of the higher-end 5G plans.\n\nThere are a few things to note on Verizon's plans. First, Verizon often limits these perks to one per account, so only one person on a family plan needs to be on an Unlimited Plan to get the Disney bundle (Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu). Other people on the plan can be on cheaper plans like 5G Start -- though it is worth mentioning that Verizon limits access to its fastest 5G networks (what it calls 5G Ultra Wideband) to its pricier unlimited plans.\n\nYour company may also offer a corporate discount on plans, but you will need to check to see if that applies to personal accounts. Those who have Fios can check if a corporate discount is available at Verizon's Deals at Work site.\n\nTeachers' discount Are you a teacher, or is someone on your family plan a teacher? You could save on your wireless bill. Verizon offers a teacher discount of up to $25 off per month depending on how many lines you have. Verizon uses ID.me to verify eligibility, with the discount appearing on your bill in \"one to two billing cycles.\" You only need to have one teacher on your plan to get the discount to apply for all lines. Details Save up to $25 per month See at Verizon Close\n\nNurses' discount Verizon's deal for nurses is identical to the teachers' deal mentioned above, with up to a $25 discount each month on wireless plans. You'll need to verify your employment through ID.me, with the discount appearing in \"one to two billing cycles.\" Only one nurse needs to be on your account for all lines to get the savings, though you can't combine the nurse discount with the teacher offer. Details Save up to $25 per month See at Verizon Close\n\nMilitary, first responders, volunteers Verizon offers a discount to active-duty military, veterans and first responders. Like with the nurse and teacher deals, you only need one person on your plan to meet these qualifications to be eligible for up to $25 off, which will vary depending on how many lines you have. Verizon is using ID.me to verify eligibility, with the military offer available to both active-duty service members and veterans. The first responder deal is open to \"firefighters, police, EMS workers, retirees, volunteers and immediate family of those fallen in the line of duty.\" Details Save up to $25 per month See at Verizon Close\n\nCollege student discount Verizon's student discount is actually pretty good. You need to be an \"actively enrolled student (including online enrollment) in a US secondary educational institution of higher learning, including undergraduate, graduate and/or vocational school or institution.\" If you fit that description, you can get four years of discounts with one line getting $10 off each month and two lines getting $25 off. The discount is available on many current plans, including the Unlimited Welcome plan. Verizon is verifying enrollment through UNIDAYS and capping the discount at two lines per account. Verizon is also requiring annual verification that you're still enrolled. Details Save up to $25 a month See at Verizon Close\n\nDiscounts for people age 55 or above Verizon has a discount for customers ages 55 or above, though you will need to be in Florida to get it. If you do, you can get unlimited talk, text and 4G LTE data for $62 a month on one line or $84 a month for two lines. Like the student deal, this is capped at a max of two lines per account. Details Exclusive service plans See at Verizon Close\n\nDiscounted subscriptions One of Verizon's most unique offers is that customers on eligible unlimited plans can add a variety of services and subscriptions for a flat rate of just $10 per month. That includes memberships, subscriptions and benefits like Walmart Plus, Disney Plus bundles, a 100GB hotspot and much more. At just $10 per month, signing up through Verizon could save you as much as $35 per month compared to signing up individually. Details Save up to $35 per month See at Verizon Close",

(NYSE:VZ) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe artificial intelligence revolution is fueling a fierce clash for increasingly scarce resources. That appears to be the case, given that a single query on ChatGPT requires nearly 10 times as much electricity as a traditional search query on Google. You will be mistaken to think that only power grids are being strained amid the AI boom.\n\nWater, land, metals, and minerals are some of the natural resources being strained as the AI race heats up. In addition to natural resources, millions of humans are always on dial engineering, correcting and training models at the heart of AI.\n\nAI mostly lives and works in data centers, which are humming with motherboards, chips, and storage devices. The demand for electricity from these centers is currently higher than the supply in many parts of the world. Likewise, Goldman Sachs reports that data centers in the US are likely to use 8% of all electricity by 2030, which is almost three times the percentage in 2022 when the AI craze first started.\n\n\u201cThe data centers have to partner with utilities, the system operators, the communities, to really establish that these things are assets to the grid and not liabilities to the grid. Nobody\u2019s going to keep approving,\u201d said Ali Fenn, president of Lancium, a company that secures land and power for data centers in Texas.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s no longer a secret that resource-intensive AI will create winners and losers. Tech giants willing to spend billions of dollars appear to be having an edge. That might explain why the US tech giants are on course to spend $320 billion in 2025, primarily to enhance their AI infrastructure.\n\nLikewise, it is a battle for supremacy between nations as they look to outdo each other on a technology that\u2019s emerged as a matter of national security. The US has already passed legislation prohibiting the sale of advanced chips and equipment to China. Beijing has also hit back with similar restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe will safeguard American AI and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to adversaries attaining AI capabilities that threaten all of our people,\u201d said US Vice President JD Vance\n\nThe fact that AI is causing conflicts over increasingly limited resources, including chips, is no longer a secret. It is encouraging tech companies to look for more effective ways to develop artificial intelligence. They are investing billions of dollars in alternative energy sources like nuclear fusion, which have been stuttering along for years or even decades without significant investment or technological advancements. Even though the world is on track to surpass important emissions targets in the fight against climate change, the demands of AI are increasing the pressure to continue burning fossil fuels to power the grid.",

(VZ) provides communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities. Valued at a market cap of $181.4 billion, the company offers communication services in the form of local phone service, long distance, wireless and data services.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \u201clarge-cap\u201d stocks and Verizon fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the telecom services industry. VZ's market leadership is driven by its strong brand reputation and customer loyalty. The company's service revenues, primarily from its large postpaid and prepaid customer base, demonstrate stability and trust. With a total of over 113 million phone customers, Verizon is known for its reliability and quality in the wireless industry.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strength, this telecommunication giant has declined 5% from its 52-week high of $45.36, achieved on Sep. 30, 2024. Moreover, it has fallen 2.9% over the past three months, lagging behind the iShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF\u2019s (IYZ) 2.7% rise over the same time frame.\n\nMoreover, in the longer term, VZ has gained 7.5% over the past 52 weeks, massively underperforming IYZ\u2019s 30.3% return. However, on a YTD basis, shares of Verizon are up 7.8%, outpacing IYZ\u2019s almost 5.9% gain over the same time frame.\n\nTo confirm its bullish trend, VZ has been trading above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages since mid-February.\n\nOn Mar. 3, Verizon and Accenture plc (ACN) announced a strategic partnership to enhance cybersecurity solutions in response to the rapidly evolving threat landscape. This collaboration aims to help businesses of all sizes combat a wide range of threats, including data breaches, phishing attacks, and social engineering.\n\nMoreover, on Feb. 26, Verizon and its collaborators Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies achieved a U.S. record-breaking 480 mbps uplink speed using sub-6 GHz spectrum.\n\nAdditionally, on Jan. 24, VZ shares saw a slight gain following the release of its better-than-expected Q4 earnings. The company posted $35.7 billion in revenue, slightly surpassing consensus estimates, and reflecting a 1.6% year-over-year increase, driven by growth in service and wireless equipment revenues. Adding to the positives, VZ delivered an adjusted EPS of $1.10, up 1.8% from the previous year, beating forecasts by a penny.\n\nVerizon\u2019s underperformance becomes more evident when compared to its rival, AT&T Inc. (T), which rallied 61.6% over the past 52 weeks and 20.4% on a YTD basis.\n\nDespite VZ\u2019s recent underperformance compared to its industry peers, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from the 25 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $46.49 suggests a slight 7.9% premium to its current levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Learn more\n\nVisible Wireless is Verizon's attempt at the low-cost mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) market. It provides access to Verizon's nationwide networks for as low as $25/month.\n\nVisible offers two plans, a standard and a premium plan, which feature unlimited data. While the standard plan is subject to deprioritized speeds behind Verizon's higher-paying customers, the premium Visible Plus plan \u2014 our top pick among the best cheap cell phone plans for unlimited data \u2014 includes 50GB of prioritized high-speed data for an added monthly fee. Both plans also include unlimited hot spot data usage at varying maximum speeds.\n\nWe tested the efficacy of Visible's base plan through routine use, assessing the MVNO's coverage consistency, data reliability, and call quality, among other factors. If you're looking to make the switch, we also outline the setup process as a new user and compare plan offerings so you can judge whether Visible has a plan that suits your needs.\n\nVisible Wireless Plans Visible's basic plan offers unlimited talk, text, and deprioritized data with mobile hot spot on Verizon's standard 5G network for $25/month. The Visible Plus plan guarantees 50GB of premium high-speed data for $45/month (or $35/month with a limited-time discount). Check price at Visible What we like Check mark icon A check mark.

In addition to the base plan's offerings, the premium plan guarantees a 50GB allotment of high-speed data and higher unlimited hot spot speeds. It also adds numerous other perks, as detailed below. Through March 31, the Visible Plus monthly rate is discounted to $35/month.\n\nPlan Monthly data allotment Monthly price Annual price Features Visible Unlimited (subject to deprioritization) $25 $275 (around $23/month) Spam protection\n\nUnlimited mobile hot spot (capped at 5Mbps)\n\nUnlimited talk and text to Mexico/Canada\n\n$5/month discount on Verizon home internet Visible Plus Unlimited (including 50GB/month of guaranteed premium high-speed data) $45 ($35 with a limited-time discount) $395 (around $33/month) Spam protection\n\nSmartwatch plan included\n\nUnlimited mobile hot spot (capped at 10Mbps)\n\nUnlimited talk and text to Mexico/Canada\n\nUnlimited talk, text, and up to 2GB of high-speed data/day in Mexico/Canada\n\nWidespread international calling and texting\n\n5G Ultra Wideband access\n\n$10/month discount on Verizon home internet\n\nOne complimentary Global Pass day each month (unlimited talk, text, and high-speed data in 140 countries)\n\nSeparating itself from Visible's standard plan, Visible Plus includes international calling from the US to over 30 countries and texting to over 200 countries, which, along with unlimited data and hot spot data, makes for an excellent deal relative to major carrier plans that offer similar benefits with a much higher price tag.\n\nWhile the Visible standard plan and upgraded Visible Plus program include unlimited data, Visible Plus customers are guaranteed 50GB of premium high-speed data monthly. This discrepancy is important to note regarding deprioritization, as Visible Plus customers won't be subjected to slower data speeds in congested areas as long as they're within their high-speed data allowance.\n\nOn the other hand, Visible's standard plan has unlimited data subject to deprioritized speeds at any time, and it doesn't have access to the newer 5G Ultra Wideband networks.\n\nVisible offers the coverage of their broadband giant parent, Verizon, at a fraction of the cost. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nWith either Visible plan, customers can bring their own phones as long as they're compatible with Verizon's network. Visible has a compatibility checker on their website, and if your phone isn't compatible, you can trade it in for credit toward a new phone. You can also keep your previous phone number through a \"porting-in\" process on Visible's website or mobile app.\n\nThe MVNO doesn't off much in the way of setup guidance beyond the articles on its online help center, and once your SIM or eSIM is activated, the setup process is complete. Overall, the experience as a new customer is barebones \u2014 particularly compared to a competitor like Mint Mobile, which provides the new user with a setup assistance kit, a guided walkthrough of the app and its capabilities, and a more easily navigable support site.\n\nIf you're new to Visible, you can test the service with a free 15-day trial; if the results are less than you'd hoped for, you can easily cancel the trial through Visible's app.\n\nCoverage area\n\nBefore signing up for Visible, check the MVNO's provided coverage map to confirm whether its network (which mirrors Verizon's US network) covers your area. Additionally, check with neighbors, friends, or social media to ensure that Verizon provides dependable service locally.\n\nVisible's coverage map mirrors Verizon's, indicating 5G and 4G/LTE covered areas in blue and 5G Ultra Wideband covered areas in teal. Visible Wireless\n\nOperating on Verizon's network, Visible provides strong 4G LTE, 5G, and top-tier 5G Ultra Wideband connections across most of the US. Visible Plus offers 5G Ultra Wideband coverage in many urban areas, so your data speeds will be the fastest that a 5G connection can provide.\n\nAn enticing reason for switching from one of Verizon's pricier premier plans to either Visible plan is that you can keep the same network coverage at a substantially lower monthly cost for a single line. However, your data will be subject to deprioritized speeds in congested areas unless you opt for Visible's premium tier.\n\nService reliability and speeds\n\nThe best feature of Visible's unlimited data plans is that your data is truly unlimited in the manner of the best cell phone plans from major carriers, meaning speeds aren't capped after you use a certain amount of data, unlike some other nominally unlimited plans.\n\nThat said, Visible's base customers are prioritized after Verizon's higher-paying customers who use the same network and could theoretically encounter slower speeds at any time. However, in areas with less network congestion, you may not experience any meaningful disruption from deprioritization.\n\nEven conducting our testing in New York City didn't leave us disappointed. On the standard Visible plan, we could load videos and social media apps with almost no buffering time, which means a lot in an urban area where everyone is using data simultaneously in proximity. Texts were sent from almost anywhere, calls went through fine, and the audio quality was quite good.\n\nVideo calls came with mixed results, however. For instance, while on a 4G connection, we could see and hear the person on the other end of the line perfectly fine. The reverse connection wasn't as clean, though; our call partners noted that our audio and video were skipping to the point of incoherence (despite being connected via a high-speed WiFi network). The issues disappeared when we tried another call while connected with four bars of 5G data.\n\nThis disparity wasn't entirely surprising, as a 4G connection will generally be less reliable than a 5G (or a 5G Ultra Wideband) connection. It's worth noting that we had a 4G connection rather than a 5G one, as our testing regions were entirely covered by Verizon 5G coverage, according to Visible's coverage map. The slower connection suggests that we were deprioritized in a congested area.\n\nOne con of being on Verizon's coverage network in a crowded area is that they're a popular network for a reason, and many people use their services. Thus, Visible customers may encounter deprioritization more frequently.\n\nCustomer support\n\nAs far as in-app and online support is concerned, Visible offers a typically distant level of customer care that you can generally expect from a wireless carrier (particularly a larger network or an MVNO operating on one), with a help center that refers the user to a knowledge base of support articles for resolving any issues you may have in setup, activation, or account information. Last year, Visible added an AI-powered tool to the help center that produces variously helpful and unhelpful summaries for searches.\n\nVisible's mobile app includes the same help center knowledge base as its desktop website and a shop tab that you can use to purchase smartwatches or upgrade your phone.\n\nVisible's app, meant to be a source for users to manage their service, could use some work. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nFrom a user experience standpoint, the shop tab in the app isn't particularly useful. Since you purchase a new phone or smartwatch infrequently, it isn't the most convenient resource to include in the mobile app. It doesn't help that the app requires you to log in every time you use it, which is a bit of a chore.\n\nYou can also manage your plan in the Account tab, view your plan specifics, and upgrade your plan from the app. All the most pertinent user information lives in the Account tab, and you can chat there with a text-based digital assistant to access quick help. However, Visible notably lacks a customer service phone number.\n\nCompared to the customer support offered by competitor Mint Mobile and the option to call customer service on Tello Mobile, Visible's app and site support are lackluster and not particularly user-friendly.\n\nCheck out our guides to Mint Mobile vs. Visible and Tello vs. Visible for further comparison between the budget carriers.\n\nShould you sign up for Visible Wireless?\n\nThe affordable unlimited plans on Visible Wireless make it an attractive budget phone carrier if you use a lot of monthly data and know that Verizon's network adequately covers your area.\n\nIn our testing, Visible's base plan had consistently reliable coverage, allowing us to send texts, make calls, and load apps seamlessly. Though we occasionally encountered disruptive, slower data speeds when taking video calls in a congested area, these instances (of likely deprioritization) were momentary and ultimately a passing blemish on an overall positive experience with the service.\n\nHowever, if you don't use massive amounts of monthly data, Visible is likely not worth the monthly price, as other budget carriers like Mint Mobile and Tello Mobile provide tiered data plans that cost less than Visible's base plan.\n\nFAQs\n\nWho owns Visible Wireless?\n\nVerizon owns Visible Wireless, and the MVNO operates using the major carrier's nationwide networks.\n\nWhile this means that users have access to Verizon's network at a considerably lower cost than Verizon's base plans, it does mean that base Visible customers will be prioritized after Verizon customers in congested areas.\n\nVisible data speeds may slow down to accommodate the higher-paying Verizon customers, who ultimately pay for convenience and top-tier data speeds.\n\nDoes Visible work internationally?\n\nIf you're a Visible customer from the US going abroad outside Mexico and Canada, you'll need to pick up a local SIM card to use data while overseas.\n\nVisible and Visible Plus provide unlimited calling and texting to Mexico and Canada from the US. Visible Plus adds unlimited data roaming in both countries, but neither plan includes international data roaming in countries outside Mexico and Canada.\n\nVisible Plus users can also make calls to over 30 countries and send texts to over 200 countries, and WiFi calling should work anywhere if you have access to a WiFi network.\n\nHow do Visible's unlimited plans work?\n\nVisible's unlimited plans, prepaid monthly or annually, include unlimited data, hot spot access, and talk and text on Verizon's coverage network. Under Verizon's umbrella, Visible users can consistently take advantage of 4G LTE speeds and even 5G (or 5G Ultra Wideband for Visible Plus users) if there isn't much network congestion.\n\nThe service is intended to be a low-cost alternative for customers who want to use Verizon's network but aren't within budget for one of the major carriers' high-end plans. Visible strips the network management process down to the basics, with no annual contracts or hidden fees, just prepaid data service.\n\nThe caveat is that while your data is unlimited, the speed of the data could slow down due to Verizon network traffic at any time on the base Visible plan or after the guaranteed 50GB of high-speed data on Visible Plus.\n\nDoes Visible offer a family plan?\n\nUnfortunately, Visible only offers unlimited plans for one line at a time and does not offer a traditional \"family\" plan. For example, if you have multiple base subscription lines on your plan, each will cost $25/month.\n\nVisible used to provide a \"Party Pay\" option that added discounts for multiple lines on the same plan, but the service ended as of January 2023.",

Leveraging open standards in this way allows for rapid integration of new, advanced capabilities into HBS configurations, ensuring new products and technology solutions are drop-in ready with no risk of vendor lock.\n\nInitial integration was completed with equipment from Nokia's leading 5G portfolio at Verizon's Boston Innovation Center and HBS components at Lockheed Martin's Valley Forge laboratory in Pennsylvania. Final systems integration, testing and demonstration were accomplished at Lockheed Martin's facility in Ft. Worth, Texas.\n\nThe demonstration included HBS connectivity to hybrid user equipment (HUE) that allows users to switch access links between commercial 5G and tactical LPx waveforms while maintaining uninterrupted user application sessions on an Android user device. LPX designates low-probability-of-detection, interception, exploitation, jamming, geolocation and spoofing. By integrating the 5G.MIL HBS with Nokia's 5G solutions, as well as demonstrating interoperability with Verizon's public 5G network and leveraging their network operations management software, Lockheed Martin and its strategic collaborators are well positioned to bring new levels of performance, scalability, and reliability to military, national security wireless, and ally international defense networks.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nThis strategic collaboration for Lockheed Martin, Nokia, and Verizon will enable continuing integration of new technology advancements, including incorporation of Nokia's 5G technology at Lockheed Martin's 5G.MIL Experimental Network site in Orlando, Florida, joining Verizon's capabilities already available on-site. With 5G's low latency, high bandwidth, and secure connectivity, warfighters can leverage real-time data and advanced situational awareness in dynamic operational environments. The team will continue to refine and enhance technical offerings, including expanding hybrid network testing to include additional user device types, broader tactical communication system interoperability, and secure public-private network configurations. This will create new ways for customers to apply enhanced capabilities to global military, national security, and homeland defense mission areas, giving operators greater connectivity, faster and more reliable wireless networks, and enhanced interoperability in support of Joint All Domain Operations.\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed Martin is a global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery.

            "content": "While iPhones have been able to send emergency messages over satellites for years, consumer Android phones have lagged behind, with only a few, such as the recent Google Pixel 9 series, offering similar services. Now, Verizon is providing its subscribers who own Samsung's Galaxy S25 series of phones connectivity to satellites, too. I saw a demonstration of it in action.\n\n2025 is shaping up to be the year that satellite-to-phone connections could dramatically expand. Some phone-makers have tried to secure connectivity for select models, and carriers have sought to offer service to most of their subscribers by partnering with satellite companies. While T-Mobile is beta testing its own system with SpaceX's Starlink network, Verizon demonstrated how its subscribers will be able to use Galaxy S25 phones to send messages through satellites.\n\nVerizon first announced its partnership with Skylo to provide its mobile subscribers with satellite connectivity last August. Over a recent video call, folks from Verizon's satellite partner Skylo demonstrated how this will work for normal texting. They used a Samsung reference device (an internal-use-only phone) running an Exynos 5400 modem, which is also used in the Google Pixel 9. It was set up to not connect to a cell network, thus simulating how satellite-only connectivity would work.\n\nThey asked for my personal cellphone number, sent an SMS message, and I received it -- once taking around 8 seconds, another time taking 27 seconds. I texted a response, which took 17 seconds to reach their device. While the reference device was set up to contact their test server rather than to an actual emergency responder, Skylo demonstrated routing SMS texts through satellites.\n\nSkylo's service can also connect to emergency responders similar to how iPhone owners have been using Emergency SOS for years. In the demo, I saw how a user would run through a questionnaire triaging the details and severity of their emergency, which would all be addressed by a live person and forwarded to emergency services in their area.\n\n\"What we're trying to show here is the production level experience, which we've worked really hard to make seamless,\" said Pete Saladino, Skylo's global head of marketing. \"And again, we're using existing satellites that are already in the sky.\"\n\nRead more: Texting From Space: Even More Phones Might Get Satellite Connectivity in 2025\n\nApple has partnered with and made large financial investments in Globalstar to use its constellation of satellites to support its iPhone 14, iPhone 15, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16E owners with satellite connectivity. Skylo, on the other hand, doesn't have its own satellites -- instead, it's partnered with half a dozen providers including ViaSat, EchoStar and Inmarsat to use their satellites. It operates as a sort of signal manager to ensure, in this case, Samsung Galaxy S25 owners with Verizon service are covered by satellite networks already operating in orbit.\n\nSkylo's already-operating satellite network is an advantage for Verizon in the carrier race for satellite coverage, though it only supports Galaxy S25 phones for now. Pixel 9 phones have satellite connectivity through a separate agreement with Skylo. T-Mobile's partnership with SpaceX kicked off a new phase last month when it launched a beta for connecting subscribers with Starlink satellites (which incidentally is available for Verizon and AT&T users, too). Along with Verizon, AT&T is still planning to connect its customers to AST SpaceMobile's network of satellites, which just received approval from the US Federal Communications Commission to begin testing this arrangement.\n\nSkylo's advantage is using already-deployed networks of satellites, which currently cover a combined 50 million square kilometers of territory (about five times the land area of the US). While Skylo's half-dozen network providers have differently sized satellites and capabilities, the company aims to provide a uniform experience and access, no matter where they connect. For instance, they don't want customers to be able to send photos in one part of the globe and not in others under their same service.\n\nWatch this: HMD OffGrid Device Gives Your Phone Access to Satellite Grids 02:19\n\nPhone-to-satellite connectivity has been limited to SMS messages and small data (like with Apple's iMessage), but no more sophisticated communications beyond that yet. Skylo is working on delivering voice calls that will hopefully be available by as early as the end of 2025, though it could arrive in mid-2026.",

Not only can you get this stunning flagship device for free without a trade-in on a new unlimited line, but the carrier is also throwing in a free iPad and Apple Watch. While you'll have to pay a little extra for the required accessory cellular lines ($15/mo) this exceptional deal is perfect if you're looking for a full suite of useful Apple tech alongside a decent unlimited plan.\n\nThe only really annoying thing about this Verizon deal is that the free iPad and Apple Watch are tied to required cellular lines. That means you're going to be paying a small sum extra per month to keep them connected. On the Ultimate plan, that would run you $15/mo extra for both lines, which is going to add up over the duration of a 36-month plan (likely still cheaper than buying them outright, though).\n\nAlso available at Verizon today...",

The French company\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen if CTO will want to bring its satellite coverage to the US and whether or not carriers will acquire the French-based company\u2019s services, but it\u2019s a very enticing possibility. Typically, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink and Amazon\u2019s Kuiper operate on the Ku- and Ka- frequency bands (26.5 GHz \u2013 40 GHz), which are dangerously close to becoming congested due to the surge in new space companies.CTO uses 5G mmWave technology, which operates between 24-100 GHz, allowing for very fast wireless communications. The French-based company\u2019s constellation of satellites will take advantage of the currently underutilized 26 GHz radio frequency.These are just some of the advantages of Musk\u2019s Starlink, but in order to compete with SpaceX, CTO needs to finish its constellation first. The French company announced plans to launch a constellation of 1,500-3,400 satellites. The first two will be launched next year while the rest should start orbiting Earth between 2027 and 2030.It remains to be seen if CTO will want to bring its satellite coverage to the US and whether or not carriers will acquire the French-based company\u2019s services, but it\u2019s a very enticing possibility.\n\nCurrently, T-Mobile\u2019s Starlink is the only space-based mobile network in the United States that automatically connects to a phone even where there\u2019s no cellular network coverage. The US has about 500,000 square miles where there\u2019s no cellular signal at all, so the only possible way to communicate via a phone is to use Starlink\u2019s satellite service.However, a French startup is currently building a constellation of Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) telecom satellites, and the first tech demonstration flight is scheduled to launch in June.Constellation Technologies and Operations (CTO) is a Paris-based startup that has a very different business model than Musk\u2019s Starlink. Instead of directly competing with carriers to offer their own services to end users like Starlink does, CTO will provide terrestrial network operators like AT&T Verizon and others with shared access to its space-based telecom services.But what is CTO getting in return for allowing all these carriers to access its space-based telecom services it operates? It\u2019s pretty simple: access to the carriers\u2019 customer bases, meaning billions of people.The approach is not even more intelligent, but the constellation that CTO is building seems to be superior to Musk\u2019s Starlink, at least on paper. First off, the company has already integrated its Early Test payload into D-Orbit\u2019s ION satellite platform, marking the first-ever use of 5G mmWave spectrum for high-speed, low-latency satellite internet transmission.Another important benefit of having a CTO satellite connection rather than one managed by Starlink is that the former\u2019s satellites are orbiting closer to the Earth, which means faster internet speeds and lower latency.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 9 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe US has always perceived advanced AI chips and equipment as a matter of national security. While preventing exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, regulations have helped limit the quantity of AI chips that can be shipped to most nations. Nevertheless, they have also granted America's closest ally unrestricted access to American AI technology.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration was the most vocal and aggressive in passing regulations that broadly restricted China's access to cutting-edge chips and the machinery needed to make them. The administration updated the controls every year to make them more stringent and catch nations that might transfer the technology to China.\n\nWhile the move has helped the US safeguard advanced computing power, it\u2019s presenting unique challenges that, if unchecked, could spell more trouble amid the artificial intelligence boom. The fact that DeepSeek was able to effectively develop its generative AI app despite the U.S. government's efforts to restrict AI development in China is one such issue cropping up.\n\nBoth policy experts and tech companies are increasingly criticizing the rules as they stifle innovation around AI. In addition, there are concerns that AI diffusion rules aim to establish a centrally planned global computing economy, according to a Brookings analysis.\n\n\"A decade from now, we will look back and recognize how quixotic it was for the U.S. government of the mid-2020s to attempt to limit the ability of people in 150 countries to perform fast multiplications,\" wrote John Villasenor, a nonresident senior fellow at Brookings and professor of electrical engineering, law, public policy, and management at UCLA.\n\nMicrosoft has already fired a warning shot, insisting that stringent AI chip export regulations could result in catastrophic results. Its concern comes amid reports China is already taking advantage of the tightened US restrictions on advanced chips and equipment. The country is reportedly urging and wooing other countries to consider its chips as it would be a better partner in the long term amid the growth of AI infrastructure. The company is already warning that the US stands to lose big business as countries shun US chips due to the stringent regulations.\n\nThe company is already lobbying the Donald Trump Administration to try to lessen some of the regulations passed in the final days of President Joe Biden's administration. The rules ended a four-year Biden administration initiative to limit China's access to cutting-edge chips that could improve its military prowess. The rules also sought to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence by plugging holes, erecting new barriers to regulate chip flow, and advancing AI worldwide.",

CNET's Ty Pendlebury says YouTube TV has \"the best channel selection bar none.\" Your subscription comes with an assortment of at least 100 channels and includes your locals as well as channels you'll actually want to watch, like AMC, ESPN, HGTV, TBS and USA. Many regional sports networks aren't included, so you may want to consider bundling Frontier internet service with the DirecTV Choice package, if those are must-haves.

This is one reason why Spectrum took home the top spot among CNET's picks of the best cable internet providers. While the Spectrum Internet and TV Select Plus bundle is nothing fancy, it will fit the needs of many households with download speeds up to 500Mbps and 160 TV channels, including regional sports networks, starting at $105 per month.

But combined with a TV bundle, it's a service worth remembering. Verizon Fios and Fios TV Test Drive are unique in that you get to experience all 425-plus channels for 60 days. The Most Fios TV (which is the most expensive TV plan) also comes with unlimited streaming on your devices. After 60 days, Verizon will custom-create a channel lineup of 125 or so networks based on your selections. That's a pretty cool feature. Compared with other internet and TV bundles, Verizon Fios is on the steeper end when it comes to pricing. Still, the starting price of $145 for internet speeds up to 300Mbps and around 425 channels is an excellent value. Read full review . . .

That price will bring you a channel lineup with 170 or more networks like ESPN, HGTV, PBS, CBS, NBC and more. The price will also include your regional sports channels.

Still, you can expect competitive prices for these bundles. The cheapest internet and TV bundle, Optimum Fiber Internet 300 and Entertainment TV(with a stream box) starts at $65 ($40 for internet, $25 for TV) per month for download speeds up to 300Mbps and a channel lineup that includes around 45 networks.

The Everything TV bundle will cost you a fair bit more, around $120 per month plus taxes and fees, but the added cost is well worth it. The package comes with more than 150 additional channels and includes regional sports channels such as MSG and Yes Network. The Extra TV package comes out to $125 monthly.

To get TV, you have to sign up for internet, which means there are technically no discounts for bundling because there are no TV-only plans to compare the pricing to. Mediacom's rates can get pretty steep for the premium TV packages. For instance, the Internet 250 and Local TV start at just $61 per month. Read full review . . .

That deal is decent if you're considering just the local channels. But if you want more channel variety, it'll cost you more. You can upgrade to Essential TV, which has 125-plus channels starting at $156 per month when bundled with Internet 250, not including a broadcast fee of around $20 to $25. If you want regional sports networks, or any sports networks at all, including ESPN, you'll need to upgrade to the Variety TV package starting at $197 a month when bundled, plus the broadcast fee and a regional sports fee. Mediacom does not offer any internet and streaming TV bundles, but if you plan to stream using your Mediacom internet service, be mindful of the data cap. The Internet 250 plan comes with a data cap of 400GB per month and a fee of $10 for each 50GB block needed to compensate for your overage.

Starting at around $50 to $59 a month plus broadcast fees (which can easily add $20 or more to the cost), this Xfinity bundle offers speeds up to 150Mbps and a cable package that includes mostly just your local channels. For $30 or more per month, you can upgrade to the Xfinity Popular TV package, which comes with over 125 channels including your regional sports networks. Upgrading your internet plan may also be worth the added cost -- Xfinity has five faster speed tiers, up to gig service with maximum speeds of 1,200Mbps in select locations -- but if 150Mbps and local channels are all you need, you can't go wrong with Xfinity Connect and Choice TV.

It could also save you money upfront and on your monthly bill via discounts or cheaper rates.\n\nBundling YouTube TV with Frontier Fiber, for example, could get you $10 off the monthly TV subscription for one year. In most locations, Xfinity offers a $10 monthly discount for each bundled service. Other bundle savings may include free installation and more generous signup bonuses, such as higher-value gift cards.\n\nSigning up for TV and internet from the same provider may also present equipment and compatibility features not available with standalone services. Combination router and TV devices, like Optimum's Altice One box, can conserve space and potentially save you money on equipment rental costs but are only available to customers who sign up for both internet and TV.\n\nHowever, a general rule of thumb is to sign up only for the services you need to avoid falling into internet pricing traps.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nTips for choosing the best internet and TV bundle\n\nAs you can see in the list above, not all bundles are the same. Not only will internet and TV bundles vary by provider, but you'll also likely have multiple bundle combinations to choose from with each provider. Here's how to select the best one for your home.\n\nUnderstand your speed and entertainment needs\n\nBefore comparing available bundles, get an idea of what internet speeds you need and which TV channels you'd like to have. Selecting the bundle that most closely matches your needs is the best way to ensure you aren't paying for services you won't use, or paying for services that can't meet your household demands.\n\nIf you wouldn't sign up for gigabit internet by itself, you probably don't need it in a bundled package. Similarly, if you wouldn't sign up for a TV package with just your local channels, you can pass on any bundles with a locals-only channel lineup.\n\nCompare internet connection types\n\nWhen comparing bundles between providers, or possibly even different bundles from the same provider, consider the internet connection type.\n\nFiber is ideal for home internet, but few providers -- AT&T, Quantum Fiber and Frontier included -- offer a fiber TV service. Unless you're bundling with Verizon Fios, expect your fiber internet provider to offer a streaming TV service, if any at all.\n\nCable internet providers typically build bundles with standard cable TV packages, though some, such as Spectrum, may also have live TV streaming packages. There are pros and cons to each.\n\nStandard cable packages often come with better reliability and more recording storage, although equipment and broadcast fees tend to be higher. Streaming can be cheaper, but the savings may come with sacrificing storage space for recording shows.\n\nSome internet providers, especially those of the DSL and satellite variety, bundle with satellite TV providers like DirecTV. Such bundles require mounting a satellite dish somewhere in your home and will likely come with a two-year contract for TV service.\n\nConsider the fees, the fine print and other extras\n\nFor the most part, what you pay for internet each month will run fairly true to the advertised price. Renting a router may add to the cost, as will taxes and other minor fees, but that's about it.\n\nTV service is a bit different. Expect a broadcast fee to add anywhere from $15 to $25 to your monthly bill, plus an additional Regional Sports Fee if you have local sports networks. Equipment can also get pricey, with added fees for each TV box you rent, plus potential charges for DVR service. Be aware of these fees when comparing and signing up for a bundle package.\n\nAlong with added fees, you'll want to consider any service terms or contractual obligations. Does the internet come with a data cap? Does that satellite TV service require a two-year contract and a significant price jump after the first year?\n\nLastly, look for any special promotions or bonus offers that come with your bundle. I say \"lastly\" because special offers are the least significant factor when choosing a bundle -- pricing, speeds, channel selection and service terms are more important. If you're debating between bundles and one comes with a $200 gift card and the other doesn't, the decision becomes a bit easier to make.\n\nDecide if bundling is necessary\n\nKeep in mind that you don't always have to bundle. There may be times when selecting internet service from one provider and TV from another is more cost-effective than bundling. For instance, Verizon Fios internet is generally a better deal than Spectrum's internet service, but Spectrum is cheaper when it comes to TV service.\n\nHow we evaluated the top internet and TV bundles\n\nHands-on testing is central to CNET's reviews and recommendations of various products and services, but such a process is impractical if not impossible when it comes to home internet. Even if we could physically test each ISP, external and unavoidable factors such as the equipment (which will vary by provider and connection type), interference from nearby networks, the local infrastructure and even the time of day could affect the results.\n\nInstead of hands-on testing, we perform frequent, in-depth evaluations of national and regional ISPs and the bundles they offer. To start, we explore a provider's availability, technology and speed details using the most recent data from the Federal Communications Commission. Next, we look into all available plan options, including the number of plans to choose from, upload and download speeds, TV channel lineups and promotional versus standard pricing.\n\nPlans can vary by region, so we run multiple serviceability checks in various service areas to provide more informed speed, channel and pricing details. We also reach out to the providers directly to verify plan and pricing information.\n\nFinally, we look at service details such as data caps, added fees, contracts, price increases and other considerations to be aware of before signing up for an internet or TV service. When available, customer satisfaction reports like those from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, not to mention a look at what real customers have to say on sites like Reddit and Downdetector.com, provide further insight into evaluating an ISP. (Downdetector is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nAfter examining the applicable providers in a given category (in this case, \"best bundles\"), we determine which providers and plans we feel should be considered among the \"best.\" If you'd like to learn more about how we evaluate internet providers, check out our breakdown of how we review ISPs.\n\nInternet and TV bundle overview\n\nBundling internet and TV together is a convenient way to sign up for multiple services, and could even save you some money versus signing up for individual services.\n\nBundles will vary by provider, and each provider is likely to offer different bundles, so be sure to explore all your options to get the best bundle for your needs and your budget. Speeds, channel selection and pricing are important considerations, but pay attention to added fees and service terms when comparing bundles. Remember, you don't have to bundle internet and TV together if it makes more sense to get internet from one provider and TV from another.\n\nInternet and TV bundle FAQs\n\nWhat is the best bundle for TV and Internet? Cable providers often have the simplest and most cost-effective internet and TV bundles. Cable ISPs such as Cox, Mediacom, Optimum, Spectrum and Xfinity, for example, have multiple internet and TV bundles to choose from with varying speeds and channel lineups. Few fiber internet providers also offer a TV service, so bundles may include a streaming service. AT&T Fiber and DirecTV Stream bundles are popular, as are Frontier Fiber and YouTube TV bundles. Show more\n\nIs it better to bundle internet and TV? If you plan on getting internet and TV anyway, you might as well bundle them. Before you do, make sure you're getting the internet speeds you need and the channels you want without a cheaper option available elsewhere. Signing up only for services that you need will protect you from pricing traps. Signing up for a $70 cable package just to watch AMC, ESPN and TBS, for example, could have you paying more than necessary. Live TV streaming services offer similar channels to cable and often cost less -- Sling TV, for example, has those three channels and costs just $40. Additionally, many providers sell a \"basic\" or \"locals only\" TV package that charges you for channels you can get over the air for free with a digital antenna. On the other hand, if you want regional sports networks, a cable TV package may be your best (and sometimes only) option. To make things just a little more complicated, many internet providers now offer an internet and streaming bundle with streaming services such as YouTube TV, Sling TV or their own exclusive streaming service in addition to traditional TV. When cheap, we've included those bundles in the list above. Show more\n\nIs it cheaper to bundle internet and TV? Bundling internet and TV together may come with a monthly discount depending on the provider. Spectrum and Xfinity offer a bundle discount, but others including AT&T, Cox and Verizon Fios currently do not. Even if there is no discount available, bundling services may still save you money by cutting or combining installation and equipment costs. Show more\n\nCan I bundle internet and TV with different providers? Many DSL and fiber providers, such as CenturyLink and Frontier, do not offer stand-alone TV service and instead partner with national providers like DirecTV and Dish or streaming services to offer bundles. In these cases, you'll be bundling internet and TV with different providers, and possibly get a discount for doing so. If you just want internet from a fiber provider and TV from your local cable provider, however, a bundled package, especially one with a discount, is doubtful. There are no bundles, for example, that combine internet from AT&T Fiber and TV from Xfinity. Show more",

Fortunately, there are deals on nearly every streaming service out there, especially when it comes to opting in for an annual plan or bundling multiple services together. Below, we've highlighted all of the best streaming deals and bundles, from Disney to Amazon and everything in between.\n\nWhile many of these deals are standard, year-round offerings, we'll keep this page updated to include limited-time-only sales so that you'll never miss out on potential savings. So far this month, we've found a few deals from STARZ and new savings on multiple DirecTV Stream plans.\n\nCheck out each streaming service's currently available deals below. We've highlighted both standard streaming services and live TV packages, with price comparisons to how much you'd pay per year with a month-to-month plan or how much you'd pay per month without bundling multiple services together. Many of the streamers offer introductory deals, which we've also outlined.\n\nParamount+\n\nThere are always year-round savings with Paramount+ annual plans compared to paying month-to-month (Essential plans go for $7.99/month, and the With Showtime tier costs $12.99/month). With both tiers, you end up saving about $35 each year by opting for the annual plan. Essential gives subscribers ad-supported on-demand content, while the Showtime upgrade offers an ad-free experience and other perks.

The streaming service is best known for its UFC pay-per-view (PPV) events, which require a subscription and an additional PPV fee. The bundle below offers further discounts when you combine an annual subscription with a PPV purchase.\n\nESPN+ (Annual Plan) $119.99 $143.88 Save 17% Get a year's access to ESPN+ for the cost of 10 months.

There are savings if you bundle Disney+ with Hulu, with Hulu and Max, with Hulu and ESPN+, with Hulu + Live TV, or if you just get an annual Disney+ ad-free subscription. We recommend trying out the Disney+ and Hulu combo (known as the Disney+ Bundle Duo) no matter what since you get two full on-demand subscriptions for only a couple of dollars more than the price of one.\n\nDisney Plus Ad-Free (Annual Plan) $139.99 $167.88 Save 17% Disney+ is an on-demand, ad-free streaming service where subscribers will be able to enjoy movies and shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, and 20th Century Fox.

The FAA regulates SpaceX and has previously squabbled with the space company.\n\nConflict of interests?\n\nIf Starlink were to win the contract from the FAA it would represent a significant test to whether it is against the conflicts of interest, given Musk's role as head of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nDOGE was formed by Trump as part of his campaign plans to significantly slash federal spending.\n\nThe division has already outlined a number of cuts to the federal government so far, including some within the Department of Energy (DOE) and even the FAA itself, cutting 400 jobs.\n\nVerizon's deal with the FAA is set to last 15 years. At the time, the carrier said the contract would see Verizon design, build, secure, integrate, and operate a new telecommunications network infrastructure and support services for the FAA.\n\nAs part of the Federal Aviation Administration Enterprise Network Services (FENS) contract, the US carrier will manufacture an enterprise network for the FAA that supports the agency's mission-critical applications across the National Airspace System, which provides Air Traffic Management to more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers.\n\nJoseph Russo, a Verizon executive vice president, said at an event earlier this week that Starlink\u2019s efforts at FAA might be complementary to Verizon\u2019s, noted the Washington Post.\n\nRusso added that Verizon was offering the \u201creliability and performance\u201d that the FAA needed, and its system was expected to be operational soon.",

Carr ordered the agency\u2019s Enforcement Bureau to investigate Comcast and NBCUniversal out of an alleged concern about their DEI initiatives. Earlier this week, NBCUniversal cancelled MSNBC programs hosted by Joy Reid, Alex Wagner, Katie Phang and Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart. Reid is Black, Wagner and Phang are Asian, and D\u00edaz-Balart is Latino. NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, who is Black, also announced this week that he\u2019s moving to a more limited role at the network.\n\n\n\nThis week, Paramount, which has its own merger with Skydance under FCC scrutiny, informed its staff it planned to scrap its DEI programs to comply with Trump-administration demands. Paramount owns CBS \u2014 which the FCC has also attacked for airing coverage the Trump administration dislikes.\n\n\n\nFree Press Co-CEO Jessica J. Gonz\u00e1lez said:\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a reason that President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr resort to using the acronym DEI when they attack diversity and inclusion efforts. DEI is just a collection of letters, a convenient bogeyman for their propaganda campaign against the growing diversity of the United States. This is part of their desperate attempt to maintain white dominance.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear-eyed about what attacks on DEI really are: an attempt to legitimize discrimination against people of color, women, people with disabilities, religious minorities, LGBTQIA+ people and others who have faced bigotry in the United States. This is morally and legally wrong. Congress created the FCC to regulate our communications sector without discriminating on the basis of one\u2019s protected status. Preventing discrimination is right there in the statute, in Title 47 of the U.S. Code, Section 151.\n\n\n\n\u201cBrendan Carr\u2019s continued attacks on diversity and inclusion programs at private companies are not only racist and sexist, they almost certainly are a dereliction of his duty to carry out the FCC\u2019s mission. Carr is trying to twist the law to claim that measures designed to increase equality are in and of themselves discriminatory. This is a disingenuous and morally reprehensible position.\n\n\n\n\u201cCarr is abusing his power by threatening to hold up mergers or otherwise punish companies with government investigations for failing to fall in line with Trump\u2019s extremist agenda. In doing so, he is eroding equal opportunity.\n\n\n\n\u201cMedia owners need to resist this unjust incursion and defend their commitments to employing a diverse workforce. Companies like Comcast, Paramount and Verizon should not capitulate or comply with Carr\u2019s witch hunt. And Congress needs to intervene and do its job overseeing the FCC, whose pursuit of censorship, discrimination and cronyism is appalling.\u201d",

            "content": "At the Barclays Communications and Content Symposium on February 25, 2025, Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%) Executive VP Joseph Russo discussed the company's network strategy and infrastructure development. Here are three things of note for investors.\n\nInternal Cloud Platform Development Drives Network Strategy\n\nVerizon has developed its own virtual cloud platform, focusing on building internal expertise in cloud computing capabilities.\n\nOur philosophy was if we are going to be the best in cloud computing, in virtualized and cloud RAN [radio access network] in the core ... then I better have an organization who's best at that, too. ... We're on this path, and we're probably about five years into this path, 40% of the network done. -- Joseph J. Russo, Executive VP & President of Global Networks and Technology\n\nVirtualizing 40% of the network means replacing old hardware with software that runs on general-purpose computers. This makes it easier to upgrade, manage, and expand the network as needed.\n\nBroadband Expansion Through Fiber and Fixed Wireless\n\nVerizon is expanding broadband coverage through both fiber deployment and millimeter wave technology for fixed wireless access. Fiber lays internet cables directly to homes, while fixed wireless uses radio waves to deliver internet without needing cables. The combination of fiber cables and radio waves help bring high-speed internet to more people.\n\nWe're anticipating building about 650,000 prems this year, which is up from prior years. ... we're now using millimeter wave to serve MDUs [multi-dwelling units] as well, which can deliver 1 gigabit speeds in MDUs in a super reliable way using millimeter wave. -- Joseph J. Russo, Executive VP & President of Global Networks and Technology\n\nBy using millimeter wave technology -- high-frequency radio signals -- Verizon can provide ultra-fast internet speeds wirelessly to buildings such as condos and apartments.\n\nThree-Pillar Approach to AI Network Infrastructure\n\nThe company outlined its AI Connect strategy focusing on three key infrastructure elements.\n\nWe're putting this under the umbrella of what we're calling AI Connect, but it's really reimagining our assets for this new AI ecosystem ... the first is ... fiber and wave services ... the second is ... space power and cooling ... and then the third is ... programmable networks. -- Joseph J. Russo, Executive VP & President of Global Networks and Technology\n\nThis means Verizon is improving three things: faster internet connections (fiber and wave), better facilities to handle all the equipment (space, power, cooling), and smarter networks that can adapt through software (programmable networks).\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nRusso outlined key focus areas including Ultra Wideband Network deployment, 5G-Advanced services development, and AI infrastructure capabilities. The company has virtualized 40% of its radio access network and operates over 50,000 small cells (essentially mini cell towers) deployed on millimeter wave -- enabling better coverage in crowded places like cities. As Russo noted, \"we are now industry experts, world-leading experts in how to run a telecom infrastructure on cloud infrastructure.\"",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "The first Trump FCC tried to give Musk nearly a billion dollars to deliver expensive Starlink access to some traffic medians and airport parking lots. The Biden FCC clawed back most of those subsidies, (correctly) arguing that the service couldn\u2019t deliver consistent speeds, and if we\u2019re going to spend taxpayer money on broadband, more future-proof and less capacity constrained options like fiber and 5G should probably be prioritized.\n\nThis reasonable ruling resulted in no limit of manufactured grievance in the Trump and GOP extended conspiracy fiction universe, with right wingers falsely claiming that Musk \u2014 who insists he hates subsidies until he doesn\u2019t \u2014 was somehow being unfairly victimized by the previous administration.\n\nNot surprisingly, Trump 2.0 is going to massively over-compensate for this fake scandal, and slather their favorite fake engineer billionaire manbaby with cash at every conceivable opportunity.\n\nThat apparently starts with giving Musk and Starlink a lucrative new FAA contract as Musk and his 4chan tween DOGE minions set about pretending to fix government by throwing it into chaos. Musk appears to be trying to elbow out Verizon, which has an existing 15 year, $2 billion contract with the agency to upgrade its infrastructure that was obtained through traditional transparent bidding processes.\n\nThe length and price tag of Starlink\u2019s new FAA contract were, unsurprisingly, not publicly disclosed. Which is weird for a DOGE figurehead that professes to care so much about transparency:\n\n\u201cThe contract comes while Musk is leading efforts to make deep cuts in federal government spending, including staffing cuts at the FAA, and some critics are raising questions about conflicts of interest over his role overseeing government agencies that are supposed to be regulating his businesses.\u201d\n\nBloomberg had a little more leaked inside detail, noting the partnership would \u201ceventually\u201d include 4,000 Starlink terminals and be deployed over the next 12 to 18 months. Follow up reporting from the Washington Post suggests there\u2019s some consternation about Musk\u2019s giant handout among FAA officials.\n\nIn a post to his right wing propaganda platform, Musk stated, without any sort of evidence, that the \u201cVerizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\u201d Basically falsely claiming that Verizon might be killing U.S. air travelers:\n\nI\u2019d just like to pause for a moment to acknowledge that as somebody who has probably written more about Verizon than anybody alive, it takes a very specific type of shitty villain to have me backing Verizon.\n\nVerizon signed up for Trump 2.0 eager to get a giant tax cut for doing nothing. And relentless attacks on organized labor. And the total evisceration of corporate oversight of whatever\u2019s left of FCC consumer protection authority. And they\u2019re keen to get their giant $20 billion merger with Frontier rubber stamped.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of potential money at stake, so I\u2019m not sure Verizon will show any backbone and file suit here. But if they don\u2019t, shareholders will certainly have the opportunity to sue. Knowing Verizon\u2019s greasy lobbying and legal practices pretty intimately, it\u2019s all a very leopards-eating-faces sort of affair.\n\nBut again, Musk stealing Verizon\u2019s FAA contract is just one of countless conflicts of interest that arise with having an unelected bureaucrat illegally declaring how government should or shouldn\u2019t function and illegally bypassing bidding processes. Not to mention the numerous privacy and national intelligence issues.\n\nThe FAA contract is certainly just the opening salvo for Musk favoritism. The U.S. government has already threatened to pull Ukraine\u2019s access to Starlink unless they sign off on a mineral deal that would be beneficial to Tesla. You probably also missed that USAID officials were investigating Starlink\u2018s use in Ukraine right before Trump and Musk engaged in a rapid unscheduled disassembly of the agency.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the Trump NTIA is also hoping to redirect some of the $42.5 billion in BEAD broadband infrastructure subsidies away from existing projects and toward Musk\u2019s Starlink whenever possible. That\u2019s not just bad due to corruption, but because it\u2019s going to wind up redirecting a lot of taxpayer money away from small local businesses and popular community-owned broadband networks.\n\nStarlink is a good option if you\u2019re stuck in the middle of nowhere with nothing else. But \u201cI didn\u2019t do the reading\u201d guys like Joe Rogan tend to think Starlink is akin to some kind of magic pixie dust you can just sprinkle around to fix everything.\n\nThey like to ignore that the platform can\u2019t really scale, customer service is largely nonexistent, and it\u2019s too expensive for the folks most in need of reliable broadband access. They like to ignore that the nature of satellite physics and capacity means slowdowns and annoying restrictions are inevitable. They also like to ignore the system is harming astronomical research and the ozone layer. You know, small details.\n\nRank corruption aside, the GOP is genuinely convinced that Musk is an engineering super-genius who can fix government with a wave of his hand. They genuinely have no idea that this persona was a press-enabled mythology providing cover for a rank opportunist who takes credit for other peoples\u2019 ideas, something the tech press only belatedly discovered during his bungled takeover of Twitter.\n\nSo they\u2019re keen on throwing all of their eggs in the Elon Musk basket, fairly oblivious to the fact they\u2019ve given absolute power to a conspiratorial oligarch who genuinely has no Earthly idea what he\u2019s actually doing. So yeah, a lot of this is just corrupt cronyism pretty typical in an authoritarian kakistocracy. But a lot of it genuinely is being driven by rank delusion into Musk\u2019s actual intellect and expertise, which is going to end extremely, extremely badly for absolutely everybody involved.\n\nMusk Leverages His Unelected Non-Existent Authority And Expertise To Steal $2 Billion FAA Contract From Verizon\n\nMore Law-Related Stories From Techdirt:\n\nMassachusetts Judge Dismisses Auto Industry Lawsuit Over State\u2019s Popular \u2018Right To Repair\u2019 Reforms\n\nSouth Dakota Lawmakers Send Unconstitutional Age-Verification Bill To The Governor\u2019s Desk\n\nNinth Circuit Says Officers Can Be Sued For Destroying A Home While Searching For A Suspect",

A decision could come as soon as Friday, though the situation remains fluid, the people said.\n\nA spokesperson for the FAA said Wednesday that the agency hadn\u2019t made any decisions about the contract, which was awarded in 2023. Verizon and SpaceX didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe crossroads comes as the FAA begins testing the use of SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite internet terminals for some of the planned upgrades. The move, first reported by Bloomberg, has raised concerns about conflicts of interest since SpaceX is regulated by the FAA and it could be seen as Musk using his influential position within the Trump administration to funnel business to his companies. At the same time, the need to modernize the FAA\u2019s systems has been a longstanding problem.\n\nBloomberg previously reported that Musk authorized a shipment of 4,000 Starlink terminals to the FAA.\n\nIn a Thursday post on X, Musk said the system Verizon was tapped to upgrade is \u201cbreaking down very rapidly\u201d and that Starlink terminals are being sent to the FAA at no cost to US taxpayers \u201con an emergency basis to restore air traffic control connectivity.\u201d\n\nFAA representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Musk\u2019s claims.\n\nThe agency previously confirmed that it is testing one Starlink terminal in Atlantic City and two terminals at non-safety critical sites in Alaska.

Learn more\n\nWhen comparing Mint Mobile to Verizon, you're comparing a smaller, value-minded carrier to a major carrier that offers premium features like faster data speeds, more hot spot data, and various other perks.\n\nMint Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) owned by T-Mobile. It uses T-Mobile's network for coverage and service and can be considered a budget version of T-Mobile. Verizon is a major carrier that owns its own network, and thanks to the premium features on its postpaid unlimited plans, it can be considerably more expensive. Verizon also has slightly cheaper prepaid plans without high-end features, but its relative \"budget\" options pale in comparison to the plan variety and cost-effectiveness of Mint Mobile, which offers some of the best cheap cell phone plans on the market.\n\nApart from pricing, the main differentiator between Mint Mobile and Verizon is network coverage. If you discover that one or the other has poor coverage in your area, that alone could settle your decision.\n\nMint Mobile (Introductory 3-Month Plans) All of Mint Mobile's three-month plans are discounted for new customers. Starting at just $15/month, you can get discounted rates on plans from 5GB up to unlimited monthly data and gain access to T-Mobile's network for unlimited calls and texts from our favorite MVNO. Check price at Mint Mobile\n\nVerizon Mobile Plans Verizon's prepaid and postpaid plans include various options for unlimited data with premium features like prioritized high-speed data, extensive mobile hot spot data, and discounts for adjacent services that may justify the cost of a major carrier. Check price at Verizon\n\nPlan offerings\n\nBoth Mint Mobile and Verizon offer a variety of data plans, including unlimited plans. However, Mint Mobile offers more plans with limited data that result in a substantially lower monthly bill, while Verizon's plans are generally more expensive across the board.\n\nMint Mobile offers prepaid plans for three, six, and 12 months. The MVNO is the better option for individuals and families (or friend groups) with multiple lines looking for a comparatively lower monthly bill, even if the carrier doesn't provide discounts for additional lines. It becomes especially affordable if you choose a limited data plan over a longer prepaid period.\n\nThe chart below compares the per-line cost of Mint Mobile's best value offering (12-month prepaid plans) to Verizon's mobile plan offerings (with the autopay and paper-free billing discount enabled), which include prepaid plans for limited or unlimited data and three different postpaid unlimited plans.\n\nPlan Mint Mobile (12 months prepaid) Verizon (prepaid for 1, 2, 3, or 4 lines) Verizon (postpaid for 1, 2, 3, or 4 lines) 5GB $15/month N/A N/A 15GB $20/month $35/month, $70/month, $105/month, $140/month N/A 20GB $25/month N/A N/A Unlimited / Welcome (VZ) $30/month $50/month, $80/month, $110/month, $140/month $65/month, $110/month, $120/month, $120/month Unlimited Plus N/A $60/month, $100/month, $140/month, $180/month $80/month, $140/month, $165/month, $180/month Unlimited Ultimate N/A N/A $90/month, $160/month, $195/month, $220/month\n\nFor those who need relatively limited data, any of Mint Mobile's plans presents better value than Verizon's 15GB prepaid plan. Read our full Mint Mobile review for a complete view of the MVNO's plan offerings.\n\nThose who want unlimited data on a budget should also ignore Verizon's prepaid plans in favor of the more cost-effective unlimited plans from Verizon's MVNO, Visible Wireless . See our full Visible Wireless review or our guide to Mint Mobile vs. Visible for a comparative breakdown of the two budget carriers.\n\nPremium features\n\nMint Mobile offers a few premium features, including mobile hot spot data, but it comes nowhere near the collection of high-end features and perks on Verizon's mainstream unlimited plans.\n\n\"Unlimited\" limits\n\nMint Mobile previously had a nominally \"unlimited\" data plan that offered 40GB of monthly data. It newly offers truly unlimited data, though unlimited customers who use more than 35GB in a month are subject to congestion-specific deprioritization behind the MVNO's lower data tiers.\n\nWhen Verizon says \"unlimited\" data, it generally means just that. Verizon has no data cap for high-speed data on its postpaid Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Ultimate plans, and its only limited \"unlimited\" plan is the postpaid Unlimited Welcome option, which has a whopping 500GB of monthly data.\n\nVerizon's prepaid Unlimited and Unlimited Plus plans offer unlimited data, but it's subject to deprioritized speeds. However, the Unlimited Plus prepaid plan guarantees 50GB of premium, prioritized monthly data.\n\nIf you don't want to experience artificially deprioritized speeds, opt for a Verizon postpaid plan. Even if you exceed 500GB of data in a month (highly unlikely), Verizon says speeds are reduced to 4Mbps, which is adequate for social media apps, music streaming, and lower-resolution video streaming at 720p.\n\nPremium data\n\nOnly Verizon's high-end Unlimited Plus and Ultimate plans feature truly unlimited premium data. Premium data remains as fast as the network allows in your coverage area, and it's prioritized against regular data for MVNO customers and those paying for less expensive plans.\n\nAll Mint Mobile plans, Verizon's prepaid plans below the Unlimited Plus tier, and Verizon's Unlimited Welcome postpaid plan offer regular data that can be deprioritized at any time, which means speeds can be artificially slowed relative to higher-paying customers in congested areas.\n\nTo be sure, even premium data can also become slower than usual during network congestion. However, in our testing, it's usually not to the extent of standard data.\n\nMobile hot spot\n\nMint Mobile offers a mobile hot spot that pulls from your regular data plan. For instance, with the 15GB data plan, you share those 15GB with your regular phone and mobile hot spot data. Oddly, Mint Mobile's unlimited plan has a 10GB limit for mobile hot spot, which is technically less than you'd get with the 20GB or 15GB plans.\n\nFor Verizon's postpaid plans, only the Unlimited Plus and Ultimate plans include 30GB and 60GB of mobile hot spot data, respectively. The Unlimited Welcome plan doesn't include mobile hot spot data. You can buy hot spot plans ranging from $20/month for 15GB to $80/month for 150GB. It's a bad deal if you often need mobile hot spot connectivity, but you can add and remove hot spot data when you want (on a monthly basis), so it's a nice option if you occasionally need it.\n\nVerizon's prepaid plans offer various mobile hot spot data tiers that are generally less cost-effective than Mint Mobile's comparable offerings. Verizon's 15GB prepaid plan pulls from your monthly data allotment, while its Unlimited plan offers only 5GB of mobile hot spot data. The Unlimited Plus Plan guarantees 25GB of prioritized, high-speed hot spot data.\n\nSmartwatch and tablet connectivity\n\nVerizon, not Mint Mobile, is the choice for those with data-connected smartwatches or tablets. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nMint Mobile doesn't offer separate plans for smartwatches or tablets that support cellular connections, like the best Apple Watch with WiFi + Cellular or the best iPad with WiFi + Cellular.\n\nIn contrast, Verizon's postpaid unlimited plans support the aforementioned cellular-connected devices with separate optional plans. Smartwatch and tablet plans start at $10/month. Note that Verizon's Unlimited Plus and Ultimate postpaid plans include a 50% discount for connected device plans.\n\nFamily or group plans\n\nMint Mobile lets you create a family plan with up to five lines but doesn't offer multi-line discounts. Rather, the family plan allows the account holder to manage the lines. You can mix various Mint Mobile plans under a family plan.\n\nVerizon lets you create a family plan with up to 10 lines, and the price per line tends to get lower with each line. For example, six to seven lines on Verizon's Unlimited Welcome plan reduce the per-line cost to $27/month (with autopay discount) compared to $30/month with four lines. In a Verizon family plan, you can also mix and match and have different plans for each line.\n\nBoth carriers feature in our guide to the best family cell phone plans.\n\nContracts\n\nWhile Mint Mobile is a prepaid carrier without contracts, it has no monthly payment option. It only offers three-, six-, or 12-month prepaid plans. You could switch to a different carrier before your plan's period runs out, but you will already have paid Mint Mobile for that plan period, and you won't get a prorated refund. With that in mind, Mint Mobile locks you in for whichever plan period you go for unless you forfeit your payment.\n\nVerizon offers prepaid plans without a contract and postpaid plans with a contract. Its mainstream unlimited plans are postpaid with a contract for month-to-month or two-year payment periods. With the month-to-month option, you can cancel your service whenever you want to without incurring an early termination fee. Surprisingly, Verizon is more flexible in this way than Mint Mobile, but there are other ways you can lock yourself in with Verizon.\n\nVerizon deals with a 36-month (three-year) commitment\n\nIf you take advantage of a Verizon phone deal \u2014 to receive a free iPhone 16, for instance \u2014 you'll be on the hook with an eligible Verizon plan and that iPhone 16 for 36 months.\n\nIf you break the phone deal's requirements before the 36-month period is up, you'll have to pay the remaining balance based on the number of months left in the period.\n\nNew Verizon customers looking at the deals for the iPhone 16 series should also note that the agreement tends to require signing up for the Unlimited Ultimate postpaid plan, the carrier's most expensive tier. Existing Verizon customers may not be beholden to that requirement.\n\nVerizon also offers a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) promotional credit. Through this credit, you commit to 36 months of Verizon service but can upgrade to a different phone bought independently of Verizon. If you break the credit terms, like changing to a non-eligible plan, you'll owe the remaining balance of the 36-month promo credit.\n\nIf you prefer the flexibility to cancel service, change plans, or upgrade phones whenever you want, we recommend avoiding any deal or promotion with a time- or plan-based requirement, like a new phone deal or BYOD discount. With that in mind, your best bet is to buy your phone separately from Verizon, as the best iPhones and best Android phones are available unlocked from various retailers, and consider the most cost-effective plan for your needs.\n\nCoverage\n\nMint Mobile's coverage map is the same as T-Mobile's, as both run on the same network. Mint Mobile\n\nMint Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) that operates on and matches T-Mobile's nationwide network coverage, while Verizon has its own network.\n\nGenerally speaking, T-Mobile (and, therefore, Mint Mobile) has excellent coverage in cities, suburbs, and highways. See our Mint Mobile vs. T-Mobile guide to compare the carriers' offerings.\n\nOn the other hand, Verizon has more widespread coverage that reaches more extensively into the rural parts of the US.\n\nYour first priority in deciding between the two carriers should be assessing Mint Mobile's and Verizon's respective coverage maps to get a general sense of how well the areas you frequent are covered.\n\nVerizon generally has better coverage in rural areas than Mint Mobile (and T-Mobile). Verizon\n\nWith so much variation in coverage across the country, it's impossible for us to say whether Mint Mobile or Verizon will work best for you in your specific location, and coverage maps alone may not be sufficient to account for real-world usability.\n\nTo that end, we'd recommend you ask family, friends, and neighbors in your area which network they use and whether they're happy with their service. If they're unhappy, you can ask which carrier they've heard works best. You can also broaden your survey by asking locals on social media platforms like Facebook or Nextdoor. It's also worth looking into coverage for out-of-town destinations you usually visit.\n\nData speeds\n\nMint Mobile offers 4G LTE and basic 5G access on T-Mobile's network with a maximum estimated speed of 357Mbps, which is more than fast enough to use data-intensive apps like social media and stream music and video. However, the MVNO is subject to deprioritized speeds at any time.\n\nAll of Verizon's plans offer access to 4G LTE and basic 5G, and each of its unlimited postpaid plans (and the Unlimited Plus prepaid plan) includes access to advanced 5G networks. These networks provide faster high- and mid-band 5G connections, also known as mmWave and C-Band 5G. Verizon calls its faster 5G networks \"5G Ultra Wideband.\"\n\nWhile Verizon Unlimited Welcome postpaid customers can connect to Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network, speeds are limited to 25Mbps. In contrast, the Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Ultimate postpaid plans can reach up to 634Mbps.\n\nAnyone can benefit from the higher speeds of the Unlimited Plus and Ultimate plans, but few arguably need them. My home's 300Mbps internet connection is more than sufficient for simultaneously streaming a 4K video, a video meeting, a Twitch stream, a smart home camera stream, scrolling through photos and videos on social media, and web browsing.\n\nStill, advanced 5G networks also have much higher capacity than basic 5G, which means they can support more network traffic with less risk of congestion and slower data speeds.\n\nPerks and discounts\n\nMint Mobile's primary discount is a new customer promotion that discounts any of its three-month plans, even the unlimited plan. Prepaid rates start at $15/month, and after three months, pricing returns to standard rates. It's more of a short-term trial offer that helps you decide whether Mint Mobile is for you.\n\nVerizon offers discounts on services that help reduce your monthly expenses, at least if you already subscribe to the services the carrier discounts. Verizon\n\nVerizon's unlimited plans have many more tempting discounts and perks. With every discount applied, including auto-pay, paper-free billing, existing Fios customer, and BYOD discounts (if you're comfortable with the BYOD 36-month commitment), Verizon's mid-tier Unlimited Plus postpaid plan with four lines can be even more affordable than Mint Mobile's unlimited prepaid plan.\n\nVerizon could actually present better overall value than Mint Mobile if you value certain perks, like discounts on the Disney Bundle, Netflix and Max, Apple One, Walmart Plus, Apple Music Family, or YouTube Premium. Even better, each line can pick a perk, so savings can pile up quickly if you have four or more lines in your account.\n\nThere are many perk and discount combinations, so you can calculate which discounts you can use, which perks make the most sense for you, and how many lines you need for the best price from Verizon.\n\nCustomer support\n\nMint Mobile's app is particularly easy to use. Eve Montie/Business Insider\n\nMint Mobile has one of the best apps in the business for managing your plans and getting related information, like how much data you've used. If you start with a lower data plan, you can quickly switch in the app anytime to a plan with more or unlimited data. Reaching a human for support is surprisingly quick and easy through the in-app chat feature or by calling Mint Mobile's dedicated support line.\n\nMy experience with Verizon customer support has been generally quite good. It's a massive company, so it's somewhat understandable that reaching a human for support can take longer than a smaller carrier like Mint Mobile. Yet, I've been able to reach customer support fairly promptly by text chat and on the phone, though how long it takes will differ on different days. Verizon also uses a call-back system that calls you when it's your turn in line to get support on the phone instead of waiting on hold.\n\nThe My Verizon app is fine, but it's more cluttered than the Mint Mobile app. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nWhile Verizon's app and website for account management generally work, they aren't as intuitive or user-friendly as Mint Mobile's. You can also encounter many Verizon ads and calls to upgrade phones, lines, and services that clutter the overall experience of using the app.\n\nWhich should you sign up for?\n\nMint Mobile and Verizon offer a variety of plans for different needs and budgets. Eve Montie, Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nWhichever carrier has the best network coverage for you should be your primary deciding factor. For example, Mint Mobile's affordable prices won't matter if T-Mobile's network doesn't provide the coverage you need. Conversely, taking advantage of Verizon's premium features and perks won't make sense if Verizon doesn't work well in your area.\n\nHowever, if both Mint Mobile and Verizon have comparable coverage in your area, consider the following:\n\nMint Mobile is the best option for budget-conscious individuals, groups, or those who know they don't need massive amounts of monthly data. It's the more cost-effective carrier across the board for those who tend to use their phones only for calls, messaging, and running basic apps.\n\nVerizon is a major carrier with prices that reflect more advanced plan offerings and features. Heavy data users might want or even need the carrier's options for extensive hot spot data, super-fast advanced 5G networks, or unlimited premium data.\n\nIf Mint Mobile's data limits or speeds seem restricting, Verizon's postpaid unlimited plans are among the best cell phone plans for larger families or friend groups with four or more lines, as plans can become significantly more affordable than one- to three-line plans. If any of Verizon's premium features are appealing or necessary, the carrier's prices are justifiable, whether you have a single-line account or 10 lines, and you can take advantage of perks and discounts to help reduce the monthly bill further on services you're already subscribed to.\n\nVerizon's Unlimited Welcome plan is the worst deal in its postpaid lineup. While comparable to Mint Mobile's unlimited plan in terms of features, with its limited data speeds relative to Verizon's mid- and top-tier plans, the Unlimited Welcome plan costs significantly more for one, two, or three lines than Mint's Unlimited plan. Only consider Verizon's Unlimited Welcome plan if you have at least four lines to add to your account.\n\nLikewise, we wouldn't recommend any of Verizon's prepaid plans against Mint Mobile's more affordable offerings for limited data or the more cost-effective unlimited plans from Verizon's MNVO, Visible Wireless.",

            "content": "The FAA has confirmed it's trying out three SpaceX Starlink broadband terminals in the United States.\n\nThis raises concerns about conflicts of interest given SpaceX is run by Elon Musk, who is closely intertwined with the US government, not just as President Trump's \u00e9minence grease but also as the overseer of DOGE, the controversial unit that's cutting federal staff and programs, and scrutinizing government contracts. Contracts like those held by the FAA.\n\nOne such contract would be a $2.4 billion 15-year deal Verizon won in 2023 to work on the FAA Enterprise Network Services (FENS) program, which involves providing \u201csecure communications, information services, and networking capabilities required to support National Airspace System (NAS) operations and agency administration functions.\u201d In short: A communications backbone for FAA systems, including air traffic control.\n\nMusk on Tuesday claimed without evidence \"the Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\u201d That's a government advisor criticizing a massive government contract, with said advisor's own company stepping in to potentially disrupt that deal.\n\nThe FAA, meanwhile, said on state media it has had problems getting weather information reliably to aviators in Alaska.\n\n\u201cThat is why the FAA has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska,\" the regulator stated, before confirming three Starlink dishes are being tested at two of its \"non-safety critical\" sites in the frigid state, with another unit being assessed at its facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nGetting internet access to remote areas like Alaska is Starlink's forte and the satellite system doesn't need the kind of infrastructure build-out needed for wired services. But Starlink isn't the only satellite provider out there and it's not clear if the agency is testing out competing technology, or is testing the service due to issues with FENS. We've asked the FAA for clarification, and Verizon for comment.\n\nAs we said, the Tesla tycoon is laying into Verizon while boosting his own company and driving the Department of Government Efficiency, aka DOGE, which seeks to overhaul the US federal government. Some might say there's a conflict of interest there, though Musk and Trump have insisted the Twitter owner will avoid any such conflicts or impropriety.\n\nDOGE last week laid off about 400 people from the FAA, or roughly one percent of its workforce. The week before that Musk and other SpaceX staffers visited the regulator to get a first-hand look at its systems, with the new Secretary of the Department of Transportation saying that inspection was just fine.\n\nMusk does have experience in wrangling US government contracts, loans, and electric vehicle subsidies. A report Wednesday by the Washington Post \u2013 owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who also owns SpaceX rival Blue Origin \u2013 claimed that in the past year alone Tesla and SpaceX took $6.8 billion in public money and over the past 20 years Musk's companies have pulled in $38 billion from the Feds. It's possible Elon's corporations bagged more money: The Post says its numbers come from publicly available documents, and military spending is often not revealed.\n\nThe newspaper also reported two sources reckon the FAA is \"close\" to scrapping that $2.4 billion Verizon contract, and may well award the FENS project to Starlink. The agency said no decisions have been made.\n\nSubsidies and such aside, Tesla, for one, has paid back at least one government loan. And the money given to, for example, SpaceX is for services rendered \u2013 rocket launches for Uncle Sam, and so forth.\n\nSome have argued that as the world's richest man, Musk doesn\u2019t need to steer government money to his pockets or companies. As Fox News host John Roberts put it: \"If you're gonna trust anybody with rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, wouldn't you want it to be a guy who really doesn't need your money?\"\n\nWe'll see. \u00ae",

The move to cancel a major contract in favor of a venture led by Musk \u2014 who is leading President Donald Trump\u2019s disruptive overhaul of the federal government through the U.S. DOGE Service \u2014 would represent a significant test of protections against conflicts of interest in government projects. It would be an especially extraordinary step for the typically cautious FAA, whose systems are vital to the safety of millions of air travelers every day.\n\nThe existing contract was awarded to Verizon in 2023, with the aim of upgrading a platform that different air traffic control facilities and FAA offices use to communicate with one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk has personally taken aim at Verizon on his social media platform X in recent days, saying on Monday: \u201cThe Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\u201d\n\nVerizon did not respond to a request for comment. Joseph Russo, a Verizon executive vice president, said at an event hosted by Barclays Bank on Tuesday that Starlink\u2019s efforts at FAA might be complementary to Verizon\u2019s. Verizon was offering the \u201creliability and performance\u201d that the FAA needed, and its system was expected to be operational soon, Russo said.\n\nThe FAA said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cno decisions have been made\u201d about the Verizon project.\n\nA team of employees from SpaceX, Starlink\u2019s parent company, has been working inside the FAA in recent days, charged by the Trump administration with helping modernize the agency\u2019s aging technology. Ted Malaska, one of them, shared a picture on X on Thursday saying he was excited to be working with the FAA, and thanking Musk and Trump for their \u201cvision and focus on safety.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI challenge anyone to question the honesty and my technical integrity on this matter,\u201d Malaska posted Wednesday. \u201cI am working without biases for the safety of people that fly.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the SpaceX employees now have FAA email addresses, according to two people who have seen the addresses, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. FAA regulates SpaceX and has alleged that the company has violated safety rules relating to its rocket launches.\n\nIn a statement Monday, the FAA said it was testing Starlink systems at facilities in New Jersey and Alaska, in hopes of providing more reliable connectivity in remote locations. Elements of the FAA\u2019s deliberations were previously reported by the Associated Press and Bloomberg News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said on Fox News this week that the government had been too slow to modernize its technology and that the new administration was ready to move quickly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at a year, year-and-a-half time frame and do massive upgrades, improve the systems, help air traffic controllers, keep our skies safer,\u201d Duffy said.\n\nBut the Starlink plan adds to Musk\u2019s existing conflicts of interest at the FAA relating to SpaceX, according to John P. Pelissero, the director of a government ethics program at Santa Clara University.\n\nPelissero said it appears that \u201cbecause of Musk\u2019s current position in DOGE and his closeness to Trump he and his company are getting an advantage and getting a contract.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s looking out for the public interest here when you get the person who\u2019s cutting budgets and personnel from the FAA, suddenly trying to benefit from still another government contract?\u201d Pelissero said.\n\nThe Transportation Department, DOGE and SpaceX did not respond to questions on how the process of changing contractors has been handled and whether potential conflicts of interest have been reviewed. Trump has said Musk will not be permitted to participate in decisions that pose a conflict of interest.\n\nVerizon was tapped in 2023 to build a system called the FAA Enterprise Network Services Program or FENS, replacing a system that dates to 2002. The contract had a 15-year lifespan, and the system is intended to connect some 4,600 sites, according to the FAA.\n\nThe agency was scheduled to make a final decision on whether to start paying Verizon for the contract next month, said one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, Musk\u2019s team determined the job should go to Starlink, the person said. But the process for unwinding a contract and awarding it to another company is lengthy and has not been followed in this case so far, the person said.\n\nSeveral senior FAA officials have refused to sign paperwork authorizing the switch, according to the person, who has been briefed on the internal deliberations and resulting fallout, so Musk\u2019s team is now seeking help from the acting administrator of the agency, Trump appointee Chris Rocheleau, and Duffy.\n\nOutside reviews of the FAA\u2019s technology have repeatedly concluded in recent years that it is woefully out of date and that the agency is too slow to make upgrades. A 2023 safety review pointed to technological problems as one factor that was creating \u201crisk\u201d in the aviation system, a problem the Verizon contract is supposed to help solve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJessica Tillipman, the associate dean for government and procurement law studies at George Washington University School of Law, said terminating a contract can be expensive, time consuming and could lead to litigation.\n\n\u201cWhen the government terminates a contract it\u2019s not like it shuts off the spigot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to wind down a contract. It\u2019s very expensive and it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nShe said negotiating a settlement can take a year.\n\nIn awarding a new contract, agencies generally must comply with rules for competitive bidding. There are exceptions, including urgency, she said.\n\n\u201cBut the question is, how is it so urgent when you already had a contractor dealing with it?,\u201d said Tillipman, adding that there are many different guardrails within the federal acquisition system to make sure things are fair, transparent and efficient.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the last few weeks she said many of these guardrails have been tested, which will likely lead to litigation,\u201d she said.\n\nWashington Post researcher Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report.",

In the Verizon deployment, Qualcomm\u2019s RAN Automation Suite DML (Data Management Layer) provides applications with RAN AI Services, including HNN (Hybrid Neural Network) and DNN (Deep Neural Network) technology, for AI-Driven RAN Management.\n\nThe other half of the announcement involves Samsung\u2019s AI-ESM, which the companies said enables the telco to maximize network energy efficiency and take on a more sustainable approach to networking without compromising performance and user experience. It does so by identifying site environments, learning traffic patterns by location and time of day and evaluating the extent of impact on network performance. Together, this helps identify the \u201coptimal threshold value,\u201d and then can automatically switch off or on cells or transmission paths within a cell site dynamically depending on network traffic, conserving power. Verizon claimed that is has achieved average energy savings gains of 15%, with a maximum of 35% per sector during low traffic periods using this technique.\n\nVerizon has been on a long journey of network virtualization and disaggregation, and has recently ramped up emphasis on Open RAN. In a press release, Verizon Senior Vice President of Network Technology, Strategy and Planning Adam Koeppe called out Open RAN benefits around competition, innovation and supplier diversification. \u201cExpanding our industry-leading success with deploying O-RAN compliant radios and distributed units throughout our network, the introduction of the [RIC] will allow for greater flexibility and control over network operations.\u201d He said the move to RIC capabilities are \u201cemerging as a key enabler of efficient, adaptive, and scalable network operations and fits within our growing portfolio of automation and orchestration capabilities on the network.\u201d",

            "content": "\u201cIn general, we\u2019re just asking way too much of individuals to get all this right. And saving during the middle years of your life to provide income throughout retirement, it really is a challenging endeavor.\u201d\n\nOne dilemma many face as they approach retirement is how much money they will need to live comfortably when they stop working. According to Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the average retiree household in the United States spends around $5,000 per month. With a median 401(k) balance of $210,724 for those aged 60 to 69, implementing the 4% withdrawal rule yields around $702 per month\u2014which, when combined with the average monthly Social Security payment of $1,976, still falls short of meeting basic needs. According to Dan Doonan, executive director of the National Institute on Retirement Security, non-wealthy workers still have insufficient retirement coverage, forcing them to save on their own:\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the 65-and-older population in the United States will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when it is expected to account for more than a quarter of the total population. The World Economic Forum further predicts that half of kids born in the United States in 2007 would survive to the age of 103. As such, wages seem to be falling behind inflation as people live longer lives. That\u2019s especially true now that businesses have moved the burden of retirement savings to employees, giving 401(k)s instead of pensions that promise a fixed income each month.\n\nAfter much suspense, the US Federal Reserve finally began cutting interest rates in late 2024, dropping the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in two cuts in September and November, with the market expecting further cuts this year. The Fed\u2019s decision came in reaction to falling US inflation and employment market statistics, which suggested that the elusive soft landing was still within reach. However, as February comes to a close, things appear to have changed. For the time being, the Federal Open Market Committee is projected to leave interest rates unchanged on March 19. That\u2019s because the labor market looks to be strong, and inflation is still over goal and slightly increasing. The FOMC\u2019s most recent meeting in January also said that \u201crespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed,\u201d implying that any reduction (if at all) will occur sometime later in 2025.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against other best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nConversely, Doonan believes that a more streamlined network of retirement schemes across the country can help private-sector companies reduce employee turnover. In addition, Congress has already taken its own steps, passing laws like the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, which alters federal retirement plan rules with the purpose of boosting access. According to Doonan, these revisions may encourage more employees to save in accounts similar to pensions.\n\nIn addition, retirees should monitor the equities market, which soared in 2023 and 2024, propelled by technology companies and optimism about AI-related advancements. According to FactSet statistics, the S&P 500 is predicted to expand by double digits this year, at a rate of 14.8%. This would outperform the trailing 10-year average of 8% profit growth. Furthermore, this strong performance may prove to be more significant than the Fed\u2019s interest rate forecast. Regarding this, Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston, said the following:\n\n\u201cWhile we anticipate 2025 is likely to be more volatile than the remarkably low volatility environment of 2024, the fundamentals remain supportive for both equities and fixed-income assets. And it\u2019s those fundamentals that matter more for the outlook than the exact number of cuts.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best retirement stocks, we used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to find large companies with low beta values, a history of reliable dividend payments, and well-established businesses. These equities were then rated using hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) the Best Retirement Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nBeta Value: 0.42\n\nDividend Yield: 6.34%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a global leader in communication, technology, and entertainment services. The company\u2019s Consumer and Business sectors provide a wide range of goods and services, including wireless and wireline solutions, and fixed wireless access (FWA) internet.\n\nBack in December, Raymond James confirmed its outlook for Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), maintaining an Outperform rating and a target price of $48. The firm noted Verizon\u2019s strong long-term fundamentals, consistent performance, and competitive dividend yields as key factors for its appeal.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) had a successful fiscal year in 2024, above expectations with a 3.1% gain in cellular service revenue and a 2.1% increase in adjusted EBITDA. In 2024, the firm earned an astounding $19.8 billion in free cash flow, allowing it to pay down debt and prepare for the planned acquisition of Frontier. In addition, the firm increased its dividend for the 18th consecutive year, with a quarterly distribution of $0.6775 per share.\n\nThird Point Management stated the following regarding Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka \u201cwireless cable\u201d) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing\u2019s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper\u2019s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.\u201d\n\nOverall, VZ ranks 7th on our list of best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "3. Can they spot clickbait?\n\nSalacious headlines and clickbait posts are designed to get attention. Teach teens to identify these tactics to distinguish meaningful content from misleading distractions.\n\nTry this:\n\nDiscuss examples of clickbait together. By building critical media literacy skills, you\u2019ll also position yourself as a resource when they inevitably encounter misinformation or deepfakes.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nDr. Rich points out that teaching teens to recognize provocative or misleading headlines can equip them to navigate online spaces more critically. This skill will prepare them to handle harmful content like misinformation or deepfakes and foster open communication about their online experiences.\n\n4. Can they put their worries to work?\n\nDoomscrolling often comes from a good place\u2014a desire to stay informed. However, it\u2019s important to help teens develop their awareness of how constantly reading stories about tragedy, war, or disaster might affect them on an emotional level. Help your teen recognize when it\u2019s time to take a break.\n\nTry this:\n\nChannel concern into action. Encourage them to volunteer, create art, or join a cause-based community to turn feelings of helplessness into meaningful engagement.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nLi explains that while it\u2019s important for kids to stay informed, constantly consuming negative news can lead to hopelessness. Channeling their energy into tangible actions\u2014like volunteering or creative expression\u2014can help them process their emotions and engage meaningfully without becoming overwhelmed. \u201c\u2026ideally, we should help them channel that engagement into real, tangible action in their community,\u201d Li says, \u201cnot just liking or resharing posts.\u201d\n\n5. Do they know why they\u2019re scrolling?\n\nMost doomscrolling happens when we grab our phones out of habit rather than with a specific purpose in mind. Practicing mindfulness can help teens use social media more purposefully and avoid spiraling.\n\nTry this:\n\nTeach them to pause before opening an app. Ask: \u201cWhy am I opening this? What do I want to feel? Am I bored? Or do I want to feel better?\u201d Set a timer for 10 minutes and check in: Did it improve their mood, or is it time to log off?\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nLi recommends teaching mindfulness as a way to counter reflexive scrolling. By setting intentions before using social media and checking in with their emotions afterward, teens can become more aware of how their habits impact their mood. Timers can help them stay on track and avoid getting lost in endless scrolling.\n\nNo matter what strategies work best for you and your family, Dr. Rich says it\u2019s important to focus on helping your child regulate their own media use rather than holding them to strict (and often unrealistic) media restrictions.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s shift our frame around interactive media from terms like \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong,\u2019 \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 \u2026 to viewing it more like an environmental health issue,\u201d Dr. Rich says. \u201cThe goal is not to just clean up the digital environment but to help our kids breathe the air that surrounds them now, in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nGet insights about your child\u2019s digital life with Verizon Family.",

Verizon declined to comment.\n\nWhile it's common for companies to recruit from their competitors, Verizon's outreach highlights how five-day office mandates have become a sticking point for some workers in recent months.\n\nAT&T told BI that its workers \"always have a choice to pick the type of company and work environment they wish to be part of.\"\n\n\"We desire individuals who wish to work in a dynamic and challenging team environment with strong relationships and collaboration fostered by in-office constructs,\" AT&T added.\n\nAT&T has had to navigate a rocky return to office this year, with some employees describing to BI a lack of desk space, parking shortages, and shifting guidance about the policy.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Verizon's job-listings website showed openings for more than 1,200 roles across the US, 10 of which were remote. Listings for several full-time positions said they required at least eight days in the office a month, as determined by a manager.\n\nThe Verizon email also referred to the company's support of DEI at a time when other large employers are backing away from DEI policies.\n\n\"If you're looking for a culture of learning that fosters diversity, equity, and inclusion with room to grow, our V Team may be the place for you,\" the email said.\n\nThe email said Verizon job perks include up to $8,000 of annual tuition assistance, up to five weeks of paid time off, paid parental leave, and medical, dental, and vision coverage.\n\nWhile AT&T traces its origins to 1885, Verizon was formed in 2000 when one of the so-called Baby Bells \u2014 spun off from AT&T in the 1980s \u2014 merged with GTE.\n\nMore recently, the two have been in a race to build out the nation's fiber optic network and extend 5G and satellite coverage.\n\nThough AT&T is now based in Dallas, its former New Jersey headquarters is a major corporate campus for Verizon \u2014 not to be confused with Bell Labs in Holmdel, which features in Apple TV's \"Severance.\"\n\nIf you are an AT&T or Verizon worker who wants to share your perspective, please contact Dominick via email or text/call/Signal at 646.768.4750.

AT&T\u2019s initial video call test occurred in June 2023.\n\n\u201cThis breakthrough marks a new era in cellular to satellite connectivity in the United States that enables seamless data transmissions \u2013 not just texts,\u201d said Hans Vestberg, chairman and CEO of Verizon. \u201cAdding this layer of ability \u2013 not only to text someone, but to be able to call, video chat, or send files - whether in the wilderness, or in a remote part of a lake community, will only enhance the reliability of our customers' connectivity and communication experience.\u201d\n\nAT&T\u2019s and Verizon\u2019s tests, completed between Midland and Dallas, Texas, both relied on AST\u2019s five BlueBird satellites launched in Sept. 2024. The company said its current constellation provides 5,600 coverage cells over the U.S., with each satellite capable of covering thousands of square miles at a time.\n\nThe successful tests come as competition intensifies between AST and its wireless partners and T-Mobile\u2019s collaboration with SpaceX on satellite-to-cell service. Earlier this month, T-Mobile and Starlink launched a public beta for text messaging, allowing users across the U.S. to test the service free of charge until July.\n\nThe FCC granted AST SpaceMobile special temporary authority in the U.S. to test these satellites with AT&T and Verizon in January 2025. This authorization permits AST to conduct non-commercial testing with unmodified smartphones using AT&T and Verizon's low-band spectrum, specifically in the 704-716 MegaHertz (MHz), 824-849 MHz, 734-746 MHz, and, 869-894 MHz frequency bands.\n\nThe special authority expires in late July 2025, as per FCC regulations limiting such authorizations to 180 days. To continue operations beyond this period, AST SpaceMobile will need to apply for an extension or seek a permanent authorization from the FCC. As of yet, SpaceX and T-Mobile\u2019s partnership was the only collaboration to receive FCC approval to provide direct-to-cell satellite services in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe know our customers want connectivity wherever they are, and they deserve a simple, seamless experience from one provider,\u201d said Jeff McElfresh, chief operating officer for AT&T. \u201cWe are striving to provide everyone, from urban centers to remote areas, with access to reliable connectivity.\u201d",

            "content": "State Farm Arena, home to the Atlanta Hawks, is taking a new IoT management solution from Verizon Business to help organise, scale, and optimise its IoT infrastructure. The US basketball team is described as the \u201cmarquee launch partner\u201d for the solution, branded Verizon Sensor Insights; other unnamed customers in food refrigeration and insurance are also on board, it said. Verizon Business was recruited as the team\u2019s \u2018wireless and technology\u2019 partner ahead of the 2024/25 season.\n\nThe solution includes approved/certified sensors and gateways, plus cellular connectivity and a central management portal. It uses Verizon\u2019s ThingSpace IoT platform. It has been installed in the technical equipment hub at State Farm Arena to monitor and manage the temperature and condition of sensitive technical equipment and to better track waste disposal and resource efficiency, and to generally enhance stadium operations.\n\nIt stated: \u201cThe Atlanta Hawks are already gaining actionable insights into the technology equipment health and IDF room environment to better predict maintenance needs and create a smarter and more efficient arena, with plans to expand into new use cases in the coming months.\u201d The new Sensor Insights offer is pitched to businesses of any size, the carrier said \u2013 \u201cincluding small and medium businesses\u201d (SMEs). It covers management of non-cellular IoT fleets, as well.\n\nA statement said: \u201cSensor Insights allows customers to activate, onboard, and manage sensors and gateways, and manage cellular and IoT connections across multiple IoT protocols including LoRaWAN [and] BLE \u2013 all from an easy-to-use central web portal. Users gain near real-time alerts and trend analysis for optimized operational decision-making.\u201d It will cover Wi-Fi connected sensors, as well, presumably \u2013 and likely devices on any other network technology, also.\n\nVerizon Business\u2019 deal with the Atlanta Hawks last year was a renewal of an existing arrangement, also; it preceded some 4G/5G radio densification in the arena \u2013 with a \u201cfocus on providing 5G using premium mmWave spectrum to the entire bowl and select VIP lounges and suites\u201d. Otherwise, Verizon Business has also installed accelerated access lanes (\u201cDelta Fly-Through Lanes\u201d) at various gates at the arena, as well as cashierless checkouts at the team store.\n\nThe access lanes, in operation since October (2024) are intended to streamline ticketing and entry. They use facial authentication technology from US firm Wicket. They have speeded-up the ticket scanning process for members, it said, so average ticket redemption times are now six seconds. So far, 2,000 fans have enrolled, and 10,000 tickets have been scanned; repeat usage is 72 percent among members, it said.\n\nThe checkouts use \u201c5G edge technology\u201d and (\u201cAI-powered\u201d) computer vision technology so fans can purchase food and beverages without waiting in lines. Verizon Business explained: \u201cCustomers simply enter the store, select their items, and exit \u2013 with purchases automatically processed through their mobile payment method.\u201d The retail solution was developed with spatial intelligence and autonomous retail solutions provider AiFi\u201d, it said.\n\nKim Rometo, chief technology and innovations officer at the Atlanta Hawks & State Farm Arena, said: \u201cState Farm Arena is constantly looking for ways to push the boundaries of innovation and improve the experience for our fans and staff. By implementing Verizon Sensor Insights, multiple stakeholders can proactively monitor and manage critical operational aspects, ensuring a more seamless and efficient experience for everyone.\u201d\n\nScott Lawrence, chief product officer at Verizon Business, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to have the Atlanta Hawks and State Farm Arena as an early adopter of Verizon Sensor Insights. This deployment is a great example of how high-performing organizations use IoT and other connected technology to improve efficiency and enhance business operations.\u201d",

The carrier said that nearly half of AT&T customers already have access to peer-to-peer messaging and emergency satellite services.\n\nAT&T did its first video call with AST in June of 2023, prior to the launch of AST\u2019s newest satellites. This time, AST SpaceMobile initiated the live NTN video call from Midland, Texas, according to AT&T, which called it \u201cone small step for man, but one giant connection for mankind.\u201d\n\nHans Vestberg, chairman and CEO of Verizon, commented on Verizon\u2019s NTN video call, saying: \u201cThis breakthrough marks a new era in cellular to satellite connectivity in the United States that enables seamless data transmissions \u2013 not just texts \u2013 in the rare instance a terrestrial cellular network is not available. Adding this layer of ability\u2014not only to text someone, but to be able to call, video chat, or send files\u2014whether in the wilderness, or in a remote part of a lake community, will only enhance the reliability of our customers\u2019 connectivity and communication experience.\u201d\n\nOther cellular network providers and device manufacturers including T-Mobile US, Vodafone, Apple and Google have been testing and prepping new NTN services in the past few months, with some options set to go commercial this year. (T-Mobile US just launched its beta NTN service with Starlink earlier this month.)\n\nIn addition to being a customer of, and investor in, AST SpaceMobile, Verizon also has a relationship with NTN connectivity provider Skylo for satellite-based, direct-to-device messaging outside of its network footprint. (Verizon and Skylo are also researching the development of satellite IoT technology and have conducted a proof-of-concept demonstrating the roaming capability of a Verizon-enabled IoT cellular device across both the mobile carrier\u2019s cellular network and Skylo\u2019s satellite network.)\n\nImage: 123RF\n\n\u201cOur team has worked tirelessly to develop a satellite to device data connection for consumers to power their lives,\u201d said Joe Russo, EVP and president of global network and technology for Verizon. \u201cWe are relentlessly focused on providing the most reliable network experience for our customers where they live, work and play, and providing this added layer of reliability is another reason our customers trust us to keep them connected wherever life takes them.\u201d\n\nAST SpaceMobile received permission from the Federal Communications Commission earlier this month to begin testing of its five new Bluebird satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), which were launched in October 2024. The satellites, whose beams are designed to support a capacity of up to 40 MHz and deliver peak data transmission speeds of up to 120 Mbps, are expected to support non-continuous cellular broadband service across parts of the U.S. and are compatible with unmodified AT&T and Verizon smartphones.\n\nAST SpaceMobile has said previously that the goal is to provide approximately 100% nationwide coverage from space with more than 5,600 coverage cells. The company is working with both Verizon and AT&T in the United States. Verizon has made a $100 million commitment to AST SpaceMobile, which comprises $65 million \u200bin\u200b commercial prepayments plus $35 million of convertible notes, plus use of the company\u2019s 850 MHz spectrum.\n\nIn related news, Vodafone\u2014another investor and customer of AST SpaceMobile\u2014last week announced a research hub dedicated to the enablement of seamless switching between LEO space-based and land mobile broadband services. The project is supported by an initial grant from the Spanish Space Agency, and the telco has tapped AST SpaceMobile and the University of M\u00e1laga (UMA) as lead partners, with other third-party technology companies and developers invited to join.\n\nThe emphasis for the hub will be on the design, testing and validation of new, open source hardware, software and processing chips that can work interchangeably in both space and terrestrial networks, Vodafone noted, adding that it will be home to space-to-land gateway, like the one the telco used for its January space direct-to-device video call, an achievement it called a world-first. Vodafone\u2019s partners, as well as other operators, will be able to use this gateway to test and validate their own services connected to AST SpaceMobile\u2019s BlueBird satellites before introducing them to the market.",

Verizon's 5G Home Internet is a great choice, not least because the carrier's excellent deal from the holiday season is still up for grabs.\n\nNot only can you get up to $300 off your home internet if you're an existing Verizon mobile customer currently, but the carrier is also throwing in one full year of Netflix and HBO Max on the house. The streaming bundle included here is worth at least $200 in value over a year so this is definitely one of the best internet deals on the market right now in terms of added value.\n\nThere are a few other great perks you can take advantage of at Verizon right now if you're looking to make the switch. For example, Verizon will waive any upfront costs for switchers specifically and the carrier also has a 5-year price guarantee.\n\nIf you're looking to lock in that price, then I'd recommend acting quickly as the T&Cs state that it's only guaranteed until Wednesday 26th. Verizon will also likely discontinue the streaming perks in favor of something else so it's definitely worth checking this one out if you're looking to not only secure speedy home internet but also save some cash on your streaming service bills.\n\nGet a year of Netflix free with Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nVerizon 5G Home Internet: get free Netflix and Max for one year\n\nVerizon's awesome promotion on its home internet (originally featured on Black Friday) is still up for grabs this week. Right now, new customers will get a full year of Netflix and HBO Max on the house - two streaming service bundles that equate to over $200 in value.

You can either trade-in an old device to potentially get the device for free thanks to a maximum rebate of up to $600 off, or you can instead just get it on an unlimited line for $5/mo. Both are pretty good but it's worth noting that Verizon is currently giving the standard iPhone 16 away for free on either a Plus or Ultimate plan. Unless you're going for a line on the basic Welcome unlimited plan, then it definitely makes sense to opt for the pricier flagship device!\n\nApple iPhone 16: free with a new line, plus free iPad and Apple Watch with an unlimited plan at Verizon\n\nAnd. here's that excellent Verizon deal on the standard iPhone 16 to compare to. As stated, the carrier is currently giving this one away with a new line on either a Plus or Ultimate plan and you can also throw in a free Apple Watch SE and a free iPad. The free accessories are fantastic here but do note that you will need to pay a little extra for some accessory cellular line, which are required for you to claim the devices free of charge.",

            "content": "What is the best internet provider in Chesapeake?\n\nCNET recommends Verizon Fios as the top internet provider in Chesapeake, offering some of the city\u2019s fastest speeds, symmetrical connections, and extensive coverage. If Verizon Fios isn\u2019t available at your address, Cox, T-Mobile and Verizon\u2019s 5G home internet are strong alternatives.\n\nLooking for savings or speed? Eligible T-Mobile and Verizon mobile customers can get home internet for $35-$45 per month. Cox leads with the fastest plan in Chesapeake, offering up to 2Gbps for $120 monthly, while other providers deliver speeds up to 1,000Mbps if Cox isn\u2019t available.\n\nOur methodology\n\nCNET considers speeds, pricing, customer service and overall value to recommend the best internet service in Chesapeake across several categories. Our evaluation includes referencing a proprietary database built over years of reviewing internet services. We validate that against provider information by spot-checking local addresses for service availability. We also do a close read of providers' terms and conditions and, when needed, will call ISPs to verify the details.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite our efforts to find the most recent and accurate information, our process has some limitations you should know about. Pricing and speed data are variable: Certain addresses may qualify for different service tiers, and monthly costs may vary, even within a city. The best way to identify your particular options is to plug your address into a provider's website.\n\nAlso, the prices, speed and other information listed above and in the provider cards below may differ from what we found in our research. The cards display the full range of a provider's pricing and speed across the US, according to our database of plan information provided directly by ISPs. At the same time, the text is specific to what's available in Chesapeake. The prices referenced within this article's text come from our research and include applicable discounts for setting up automatic payments each month -- a standard industry offering. Discounts and promotions might also be available for signing a term contract or bundling multiple services.\n\nTo learn more about how we review internet providers, visit our full methodology page.\n\nBest internet in Chesapeake\n\nVerizon Fios\n\nDespite comparable coverage from Verizon and Cox, Verizon Fios offers symmetrical download and upload speeds that can't be matched. Customers can choose from three plans: 300Mbps for $50, 500Mbps for $75 and 1 gigabit for $90. Existing Verizon customers will be able to bring down prices dramatically bundling the home internet service with their smartphone plans. You won't see a price increase after the first year with any of these plans, and unlimited data is included in the monthly cost. Verizon also includes a range of freebies with premium plans, like an year of Netflix and Max.\n\nverizon-fios-cnetbb-logo-c.jpg\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow to find internet deals and promotions in Chesapeake\n\nThe best internet deals and top promotions in Chesapeake depend on what discounts are available during that period. Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers.\n\nChesapeake internet providers, such as Cox, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Many, including Verizon and T-Mobile, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nPhoto by Ferrantraite/Getty Images\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nWhat\u2019s a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate video conferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and video conferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like video conferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Chesapeake\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike with the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answers to those questions are often layered and complex, but the providers who come closest to yes on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, but we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and the FCC. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Chesapeake FAQ\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Chesapeake?\n\nVerizon Fios is the best internet service provider in Chesapeake. This provider offers wide coverage, symmetrical speeds, unlimited data and no yearly contract. It's the best choice for most Chesapeake residents.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Chesapeake?\n\nYes. Verizon Fios is Chesapeake\u2019s largest fiber provider, but select households might be able to access Cox\u2019s fiber network.\n\nWho is the cheapest internet provider in Chesapeake?\n\nT-Mobile and Verizon offer discounts for eligible mobile customers, so you might pay less and reach faster speeds with those ISPs.\n\nWhich internet provider in Chesapeake offers the fastest plan?\n\nThe fastest speed you can get in Chesapeake is 2 gigabits, which Cox offers for $120 monthly.",

            "content": "Feb. 21, 2025 \u2013 Pennsylvania broadband advocates pressed the state\u2019s Public Utility Commission on Thursday to require state-specific consumer protections before approving Verizon\u2019s proposed acquisition of Frontier Communications.\n\nThe push for conditions on the deal comes as residents report years of poor service from Frontier, including weeks-long outages, slow DSL speeds, and aging infrastructure. These advocates argued that Verizon must commit to expanding broadband access, improving service quality, and public safety conditions, before the deal moves forward.\n\nBarrett Sheridan, an attorney with the Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate (OCA), emerged as the most vocal in calling for state-specific consumer benefits in the PUC\u2019s review of the Verizon-Frontier merger.\n\n\u201cPart of the question is, will there be public benefits?,\u201d Sheridan questioned. \u201cConsumers depend on Frontier and Verizon for critical telephone service and other communications.\u201d\n\nThe OCA, alongside the Pennsylvania Office of Small Business Advocate (OSBA), filed a formal protest against the Verizon-Frontier application. Their reasoning: the PUC must determine if the transaction delivers specific, measurable benefits to Pennsylvanians, not just general corporate assurances.\n\nEmergency communications a key concern\n\nOne of the most pressing issues raised during the hearing was 911 service reliability \u2014 or lack thereof in some Pennsylvania communities.\n\nLisa Rice, director of Tioga County 911 Services, said that Verizon must improve emergency communications, particularly in rural areas where Frontier\u2019s failures have left communities vulnerable.\n\nRice highlighted persistent problems with 911 call reliability in parts of Pennsylvania served by Frontier. Some fire departments have had to station personnel at fire halls so that residents could drive to them for help when phones were down.\n\n\"We still struggle to receive 911 calls from certain areas, particularly around Potter County,\" Rice said. \"Although we have seen some improvements, I'm hopeful that the Verizon acquisition, should that go through, will show some market improvements for the residents of the area that I serve.\u201d\n\nSteven Gray, an attorney with the OSBA, emphasized the need for specific guarantees that small businesses would not face higher costs or service disruptions. The OSBA urged the PUC to require Verizon to: expand broadband access in business districts; improve service reliability to prevent disruptions; and, ensure fair pricing for business customers post-merger.\n\nRepresenting a development of 17 dwellings in Salt Lake County, Tom Sniscak, an energy and telecommunications attorney with Hawke McKeon & Sniscak, painted a picture of broadband inequity in rural Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThere's fiber service on either side of us, but not here. We're still receiving 1993 levels of service here in 2025,\u201d Sniscak said. \u201cIt's mainly over copper and DSL. It's slow. We have buffering. We have outages. People can't work from home. [Some residents] actually run independent small businesses from their homes. So it's a problem.\u201d\n\nAn opportunity to vent frustrations\n\nFor many Pennsylvania residents, the hearing was an opportunity to voice long-standing frustrations with Frontier\u2019s service.\n\nOne resident of Wellsboro, who has relied on Frontier for years, testified that service has only worsened despite prior PUC hearings promising improvements.\n\n\"If I had a chance to move away from Frontier, I would do it in a heartbeat,\" he said. \"My landline used to be reliable, but for the past 18 months, it's been out more than it\u2019s worked.\"\n\nA former professor, living in Middlebury Center, Pa., described extreme measures he had to take to work remotely during the pandemic due to Frontier\u2019s unreliable service.\n\n\"I had to drive miles up a mountain to teach a class from my truck because my internet was down,\" he said. \"Frontier is still stealing from the customer because they advertise certain internet speeds, knowing full well they can\u2019t provide them.\"\n\nAnd, a property manager for senior citizens residing in Genes raised public safety concerns about landline outages leaving elderly residents unable to call for help.\n\n\"When my phone goes out, there\u2019s no way for people to call 911 for help,\" she testified. \"I have no cell service for a 30-minute drive through rural Pennsylvania. That\u2019s unacceptable.\"\n\nVerizon defended the deal\n\nVerizon, represented by attorney Susan Paiva, defended the deal. \"Our position is that because Verizon is a financially stronger company that has great experience in operating networks \u2013 including operating in many other parts of Pennsylvania \u2013 we would be good stewards of Frontier territories, and would help them operate stronger and better.\u201d\n\nStill, some residents remained doubtful, noting that Verizon previously sold these same assets to Frontier. \u201cVerizon used to own these areas, then got rid of them. Why buy them back now?,\u201d one participant questioned.\n\nNext, the Pennsylvania PUC will review public input before deciding to approve the merger, reject it outright, or impose merger conditions. These conditions could include binding commitments to improve 911 reliability, mandates for service expansion in rural areas, or accountability measures if Verizon fails to meet certain benchmarks.\n\nThe public input process will be ongoing, with additional hearings scheduled in March in Pittsburgh, the Poconos, and Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Verizon and Frontier must still secure approval from the FCC and other state regulators before the deal can proceed. The Pennsylvania PUC\u2019s final decision was expected by September 2025.",

Instead of rigid bundles, Verizon allows users to select the perks that fit their needs, whether that\u2019s premium content, additional data, or international coverage. By prioritizing choice and transparency, Verizon is eliminating unnecessary costs and making its offerings more valuable. As subscription fatigue grows, companies that empower consumers with flexibility will build deeper trust and long-term loyalty.\n\n[06:11] Content Is a Competitive Edge \u2014 Consumers have endless entertainment options, but managing multiple streaming subscriptions is overwhelming. Verizon is cutting through the clutter by bundling top-tier services like Netflix, Max, Disney+, and YouTube Premium at an exclusive discount\u2014allowing customers to consolidate their subscriptions and save on the content they actually want. This approach not only provides value for consumers but also strengthens Verizon\u2019s role as a key distribution partner for streaming platforms.\n\n[10:16] AI Is Reshaping the Customer Experience \u2014 Verizon is integrating AI to anticipate customer needs, automate support, and enhance real-time interactions. AI-powered tools are already helping frontline reps deliver faster resolutions, while predictive analytics improve troubleshooting before issues escalate. Even beyond service, AI is enabling new experiences, like editing photos with a single tap on AI-driven devices. The companies that win in this space won\u2019t just use AI for automation\u2014they\u2019ll use it to create more intuitive, seamless experiences that make life easier.\n\n[14:36] The Broadband Landscape Is Changing \u2014 Traditional broadband providers have relied on fixed infrastructure, but Verizon is expanding access with fixed wireless home internet, making high-speed broadband available without the need for costly fiber installations. This is particularly game-changing in urban buildings with restricted service options and rural areas with limited connectivity. With an increasing number of customers opting for wireless over wired broadband, Verizon is redefining how consumers think about home internet\u2014prioritizing flexibility, accessibility, and contract-free options.",

            "content": "Back in December, a piece of news gained quite the buzz about a U.S. Army soldier being indicted and arrested. He was said to be guilty of collecting and selling phone records of both AT&T and Verizon customers illegally. While telecommunication service providers had to deal with the leaked data of users, which put them at risk of exploitation, it was not until now that Cameron John Wagenius pleaded guilty and admitted to being involved in stealing massive amounts of phone records.\n\nU.S. Army soldier pleaded guilty to hacking AT&T and Verizon and stealing major user records\n\nThe U.S. soldier, Cameron John Wagenius, was charged in December for posting online call logs of high-profile individuals such as President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Wagenius operated under the alias \"Kiberphant0m\" and even threatened to expose classified U.S. government call records if demands were not fulfilled. He was also linked to the major Snowflake data breach in 2024 that compromised about 1500 user accounts. AT&T and Verizon were the two major companies that were exposed to this illegal access, and a substantial amount of their users' data was stolen.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, Cameron John Wagenius admitted to charges of illegally sharing call record information online and of being involved in hacking AT&T and Verizon phone records. The two charges against him potentially add up to $250,000 in fines and up to 10 years in prison. Wagenius is also allegedly associated with another cybercriminal, Connor Riley Moucka, who was arrested in October. However, since Wagenius carried out the selling of the data that was hacked, he was not directly held accountable for the breaching of Snowflake or AT&T.\n\nAs per the report last month, U.S. Attorney Tessa Gorman explained to the court how the hacking incident related to AT&T and Verizon was not alone and, in fact, part of a broader plan. This is because both breaches were linked to the same unauthorized computer access and extortion attempts. She also pointed out how the legal cases against Wagenius had the same evidence and legal processes, confirming that all these cyber crimes fall under a broader hacking operation.\n\nWhile cyberattacks are on the rise, authorities are increasingly focused on holding the hacking parties seriously accountable for such crimes by levying heavy fines and ordering longer sentences. Companies should also stay vigilant about any possible vulnerabilities in their systems to avoid having their systems compromised.",

            "content": "VIROQUA - The Viroqua Public Works and Parks and Recreation Committees held a joint meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 12 to consider a request from Verizon to begin research pursuant to placing a cell phone antenna on the water tower in Eckhardt Park.\n\nPublic Works Committee members Jeff Gohlke, Mike Koppa, Steve Bekkedal, John Thompson and Gregory Splinter; and Parks and Recreation Committee members Terry Noble, Mike Koppa, John Thompson, Cyndy Hubbard, and Sondra Naxi, voted unanimously to deny the request.\n\nThe motion was made by Mike Koppa, and seconded by Cyndy Hubbard to \u201cdeny the request by Verizon to use the water tower in Eckhardt Park for cell antennas and equipment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the first joint meeting of the two committees ever held, the committee voted to deny Verizon their request to conduct land surveys for their proposed site plan,\u201d Viroqua City Engineer Sarah Grainger said. \u201cIn their request, Verizon cited state and federal laws giving them the right to site cell phone antennas. The request stops with the committee and will not require further action by the Viroqua City Council.\u201d\n\nOver a dozen local residents shared their concern for the health and safety of those of us who live near by or use the park for recreation and relaxation.\n\nViroqua resident and Verizon customer Dave Breitbach expressed concern about the proximity of the proposed antenna to residences, and Sarah Caldwell stated that she is \u201clight sensitive,\u201d and felt siting the antenna in the park would \u201caffect her health.\u201d Toby Gratz was concerned about electromagnetic waves that could cause corrosion of the water towner. Dallas Seevers also expressed concern about potential damage to the water tower, and in addition feared that siting the antenna in the park could cause a decline in nearby property values. Zachary Mathes stated that \u201cI do not want children playing under a cell phone antenna.\u201d Ximena Puig stated that \u201cif the antenna is sited in the park, I will have to move because the health of my children matters.\u201d Paula Grenier stated support for keeping the nature of the park and preserving the value of the forest. Tom Westhoff was opposed to siting the tower in the park, stating, \u201cthe antenna will pose potential health risks, and there are already 22 cell towers and 58 antennas within four miles of Viroqua.\u201d\n\nAccording to Grainger, the committees discussed work by attorney Anita Galucci for the Wisconsin League of Municipalities, to create a sample ordinance for municipalities to use to craft their own ordinances to protect all of the powers remaining to them. The purpose of the sample ordinance will be to proactively best position municipalities in a situation where they may experience a legal challenge to a decision they may make.\n\nIn the public input section of the City of Viroqua\u2019s consideration of Verizon\u2019s request, local resident Claire DeCoster weighed in.\n\n\u201cI am excited about the possibility of Governor Tony Evers administration exploring making changes to state laws that limit municipality\u2019s ability to regulate where cell phone towers are located.\u201d\n\n2018 FCC Order\n\nIn a Memorandum regarding the FCC 2018 Small Cell Order and Model Ordinance for Siting of Wireless Facilities in Local Rights-of-Way, available on the Wisconsin League of Municipalities web site, Attorney Galucci gives an overview of state and federal legal limitations on the ability of municipalities to regulate cell phone facility siting:\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC\u2019s) 2018 Small Cell Order, which largely took effect January 14, 2019, contains new and significant limitations on a municipality\u2019s ability to regulate wireless facilities in local rights-of-way (ROW).\n\nThe 2018 order affects municipal regulation of all wireless telecommunications facilities in the ROW, but the order is directed at small wireless facilities (SWF) used to provide personal wireless services to the public (eg. cell phone service). Small cell systems, as well as distributed antenna systems, are deployed to serve areas of high demand and to enhance broadband capacity.\n\nThese systems typically use relatively small antennas and equipment cabinets installed on utility poles, street light poles, traffic signal poles, or stand-alone poles. Small cell and distributed antenna system components in the ROW can include: poles, antennas, base stations or equipment cabinets, power sources or meters, canisters or boxes attached to a pole for housing antennas or equipment, and fiber lines.\n\nThe purpose of the 2018 Small Cell Orderis to remove perceived barriers to the deployment of wireless broadband services by ensuring that wireless broadband providers have low-cost and easy access to municipal property located in local ROW. The 2018 order attempts to achieve this purpose by limiting municipal authority to regulate the placement of SWF in local ROW and on municipally owned structures in the ROW, including light poles, traffic light poles, and utility poles.\n\nThe FCC looks to Sections 253 and 332 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \u201cAct\u201d) as the basis for its legal authority. First Section 253(a) of the Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7253(a), provides that \u201c[n]o State or local statute or regulation, or other State or local legal requirement, may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service. In addition, Section 253(c) preserves state and local authority to regulate the ROW and \u201cto require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers,\u201d provided that such regulations are \u201ccompetitively neutral\u201d and \u201cnondiscriminatory.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the FCC declared that an effective prohibition occurs where a municipal legal requirement \u201cmaterially limits or inhibits any competitor\u2019s or potential competitor\u2019s ability to compete in a fair and balanced legal and regulatory environment.\u201d Thus the test is now applied not only when a provider is trying to fill a gap in coverage, but also when the provider proposes to densify its existing wireless network, introduce new services, or otherwise improve service capabilities.\n\nBy its terms, Section 253 applies both to wireline and wireless telecommunications facilities located in the ROW. Section 332(c)(7) had previously only been applied to wireless facilities outside the ROW. The 2018 Order clarifies that Section 332(c)(7) also applies to wireless facilities inside the ROW and that both 253(a) and 332(c)(7) apply to \u201cwireless telecommunications services as well as to commingled services and facilities.\n\nHome Rule limited\n\nAlthough municipalities have the right to regulate wireless telecommunications facilities sited in local ROW pursuant to their statutory home rule powers, Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7196.58(1r), and 182.017(1r), there are significant limitations imposed on municipal regulatory authority by both state and federal laws and regulations.\n\nUnder Wisconsin law, a municipality has the authority to regulate utility facilities in the ROW, subject to the requirement that those regulations be \u201creasonable\u201d and defensible on public health, safety, and welfare grounds. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSC) has been authorized to hear complaints by utility companies challenging a particular municipal regulation as unreasonable. If the PSC finds the regulation to be unreasonable, then the regulation is legally void.\n\nSpecific ways that state law inhibits communities from limiting companies from installing new or expanding existing cell phone facilities are as follows:\n\n\u00b7 prohibition of express moratoriums enacted by municipalities which are outright prohibitions\n\n\u00b7 prohibition of de facto moratoriums which are \u201clocal actions that are not express moratoriums, but that effectively halt or suspend the acceptance, processing, or approval of applications or permits\n\n\u00b7 strict regulation of the time limits for review and action on applications to place wireless telecommunications facilities in local ROW. These time limits are referred to as \u201cshot clocks\u201d and can vary based on the type of application submitted. The State of Wisconsin also has shot clocks.\n\n\u00b7 Requirement that fees be \u201creasonable,\u201d according to strictly defined standards.\n\n\u00b7 Requirement that aesthetic requirements be reasonable and no more burdensome than for other types of infrastructure deployment, objective, and published in advance.\n\nLegal challenges\n\nCommunities across the country and several municipal organizations have filed petitions challenging the 2018 Order, according to Galucci. The cases raise substantial questions regarding the validity of the order, and among other things, challenge the FCCs new effective prohibitions test.\n\nAttorney Galucci states in the Memorandum regarding a sample ordinance being developed for the Wisconsin League of Municipalities that, given the possibility that the order may be overturned, they have tried to avoid incorporating the FCCs standards themselves into the Model Ordinance. Otherwise, there is a risk that the ordinance may require the municipality to continue to comply with those standards even after they have been overturned.\n\n<!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-fareast-font-family:\" \";} .MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-size:10.0pt; mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:\" \";} @page WordSection1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;} /* List Definitions */ @list l0 {mso-list-id:2088795577; mso-list-type:hybrid; mso-list-template-ids:-683356038 -188430886 67698691 67698693 67698689 67698691 67698693 67698689 67698691 67698693;} @list l0:level1 {mso-level-start-at:2018; mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:.25in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family:\" \"; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;} @list l0:level2 {mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:o; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:.75in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:\"Courier New\";} @list l0:level3 {mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:1.25in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:Wingdings;} @list l0:level4 {mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:1.75in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:Symbol;} @list l0:level5 {mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:o; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:2.25in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:\"Courier New\";} @list l0:level6 {mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:2.75in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:Wingdings;} @list l0:level7 {mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:3.25in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:Symbol;} @list l0:level8 {mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:o; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:3.75in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:\"Courier New\";} @list l0:level9 {mso-level-number-format:bullet; mso-level-text:; mso-level-tab-stop:none; mso-level-number-position:left; margin-left:4.25in; text-indent:-.25in; font-family:Wingdings;} --> To find a complete copy of attorney Galucci\u2019s sample ordinance, go to http://www.lwm-info.org/1538/Telecommunications-Including-Small-Cell",

Maple Flats is a 326-MWdc/250-MWac project.\n\nTwo other projects included in the deal are Cadence Solar, a 240-MW solar farm in Ohio set to begin operating in 2026, and the 350-MW Chalk Bluff installation in Arkansas, expected to come online in 2027. Chalk Bluff also is contracted to provide power for technology company Meta as part of a deal announced late last year. Invenergy has agreements for more than 1 GW of power with Meta, and also has power deals with Tesla and Honda, including for power from the 300-MW Delilah Solar Energy Center in Lamar, Texas, that entered commercial operation earlier this month.\n\nVerizon will pay for electricity and receive clean energy credits through the PPAs announced Wednesday. Invenergy has said the solar projects tied to PPAs represent an investment of more than $4 billion.\n\nChris Orzel, a senior vice president with Invenergy, in a statement said the projects \u201cdeliver jobs and economic benefits to local communities and add more American energy to the grid.\u201d\n\nInvenergy in late January said it had successfully closed a $1.1-billion debt financing facility for the Cadence project, along with two other utility-scale solar projects in Indiana and Tennessee. The company said the financing package includes a construction/bridge loan facility and a letter of credit facility.\n\nThe money supports development of the Cadence project, along with the 200-MW Trade Post Solar Energy Center in Indiana, and the 150-MW Yum Yum Solar Energy Center in Tennessee.

The sale includes accessories for both iPhone and Android smartphones.\n\nIs Verizon a good carrier for phone deals?\n\nYes \u2014 in fact, Verizon ranks as No. 2 right now in our best phone carriers guide. This position comes down to a couple of key factors but mostly, it's due to its speed and coverage.\n\nWhen we've done tests on the LTE speeds, Verizon has been the highest performer. Its 5G reaches more than 70 cities and we've seen it easily offer 1Gbps download speeds.\n\nCombine Verizon's expanding 5G service with its extensive LTE network, and that's pretty comprehensive coverage. Verizon's overall 5G speeds don't quite match those of its rivals \u2014 the carrier's nationwide network isn't nearly as fast as Ultra Wideband \u2014 but performance is strong on the carrier.\n\nHowever, Verizon is by no means an affordable carrier and is frequently one of the most expensive options. You will likely find cheaper prices from T-Mobile or maybe even AT&T but its high performance makes up for this cost.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nWhat kind of promotions does Verizon offer?\n\nTrade-in: Verizon has a number of great offers when it comes to phone deals but the main one is its trade-in promo. Verizon can offer you up to $1,000 off when you trade in on a large number of its phones.\n\nHowever, this is a maximum amount, reserved for high value (that is, newer and more expensive) devices. But even if you're trading in a budget handset, you should see a pretty significant reduction in price on your new device.\n\nVerizon recently extended its trade-in scheme to also cover old or or damaged phones (as long as they are free of battery damage). This obviously won't get you as much but its nice to know if you have a damaged phone.\n\n\n\nUpgrades: If you're an existing Verizon customer, you will have the option to upgrade. This is going to give you a number of pretty big discounts across a load of handsets when you log in. This is limited to unlimited plans and Verizon doesn't always offer this kind of discount so it is worth checking when you upgrade.\n\nFree plans: On a number of cheaper devices like the iPhone SE or Moto G Stylus, you can often get the phone for free. You do have to take out an unlimited plan, and the \"free\" part of the deal comes in the form of monthly bill credits, but this is a great promotion for those who know they'll be investing in a budget handset.",

            "content": "Cameron John Wagenius, a former US Army soldier, pleaded guilty to his role in a hack that affected AT&T and Verizon and resulted in the theft of data from well over 100 million customers of the companies, according to TechCrunch. Wagenius, a 20-year-old stationed in Texas, copped to two counts of \u201cunlawful transfer of confidential phone records information\u201d and will face a fine of up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison for each of the charges.\n\nWagenius was taken into custody last year after being indicted for his alleged role in a hack of the two major wireless carriers. AT&T reported that the breach allowed the hacker to access \u201cnearly all\u201d of its customers\u2019 phone records, including histories of calls and texts made by its users, over a six-month period in 2022. More than 110 million were notified of the breach because their data was impacted. Verizon similarly reported that it had a significant collection of customer call logs stolen.\n\nBoth of the hacks that involved Wagenius are believed to be related to Snowflake, a cloud services and data analytics provider. It\u2019s believed that Wagenius and his alleged accomplices were able to access data from AT&T, Verizon, and more than 160 other companies including Ticketmaster and LendingTree through unprotected accounts that had access to Snowflake customer accounts. Prosecutors allege that the hackers were able to access everything from social security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers to passport details and banking information.\n\nTwo other people have also been indicted about the Snowflake hack: Connor Moucka and John Binns. According to the Justice Department, the two were able to steal \u201cbillions of sensitive customer records,\u201d and successfully used that access to extort three victims, who ultimately paid at least 36 bitcoin (valued at $2.5 million at the time of payment) to the hackers. Their extortion campaign ran from November 2023 to October 2024, shortly before they were ultimately charged and arrested.\n\nMoucka, who lives in Canada, didn\u2019t exactly shy away from discussing his role in the hack. He was in communication with 404 Media leading up to his arrest and told the publication believed law enforcement was after him. Binns, an American who was living in Turkey, also didn\u2019t shy away from media. He took direct credit for the breach of AT&T in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWagenius, by comparison, was a little more press-shy\u2014but apparently didn\u2019t have the strongest OPSEC, as investigators like Brian Krebs were able to pinpoint his identity based on forum posts and online activity.",

Well, T-Mobile has got you covered, according to a new report by Ookla 5G and its super good speeds are something many have been enjoying for a few years now. However, it didn't start exactly glamorous for Americans living in rural areas. The big three major carriers have been working on expanding their coverage all over the US and a new report from Ookla highlights who's got more when it comes to their 5G network in rural markets.As you may know, the strategies for expansion in rural areas depend on what parts of the 5G spectrum each carrier holds: and more importantly, how much mid-band spectrum they have. Guess who the winner is?According to the report,is currently rocking the largest percentage of 5G users spending the majority of their time on its 5G network in both urban and rural markets.Ookla's 5G Availability metric was used for the report, which basically shows how likely a user, on average, is to have 5G service available.Availability is influenced by 5G network coverage, but also network policies of each carrier. For example, some providers may prioritize 4G-LTE for tasks that require smaller data transfer. The data from the research measures the percentage of 5G active users connected to 5G a majority of the time, and that's based on when the 5G icon is shown on your phone.has been hitting the gas on its rural expansion, and the Magenta carrier had a goal of reaching a 20% share of households in small markets by the end of 2025. By 2026,wants to provide coverage to 90% of America's rural population. Big goals, indeed, but the carrier doesn't seem to be holding its horses.'s growth and lead in the number of 5G users on 5G in both urban and rural markets is determined by an analysis from 2019 to 2024. AT&T came in second, and Verizon came in last.'s lead isn't particularly surprising, as by the second half of last year, the carrier recorded its highest 5G Availability score in the US: 89.4% of its users on its 5G network the majority of the time.The carrier has been strategically planning, it seems. It first deployed 5G in 2019 in its low-band 600MHz spectrum, which it now calls its Extended Range 5G. By 2023, Extended Range 5G covered 323 million people, and nowadays, it's grown to 98% of the US.Of course, T-Mobile also acquired Sprint in 2020 and thus was able to deploy 5G in the 2.5GHz spectrum. One condition for getting approved for this deal by the FCC (Federal Trade Commission) was forto deploy 5G service to 97% of the US population in three years, and to 99% in six.Nowadays,'s mid-band spectrum is called the Ultra Capacity 5G, and covers a staggering amount of more than 300 million people in the US with it.Andisn't stopping here either. Later this year, we're expectingto close a deal to acquire around 30% of USCellular's spectrum holdings and all of its 4.5 million customers and retail stores for $4.4 billion.Of course,coming first doesn't meanorhaven't been growing. Let's see what the research shows on the other two big players on the US carrier scene.FirstNet is's nationwide public safety network for first responders. It uses band 14, which uses a 10 MHz spectrum allocation in the 758\u2013768 MHz and 788\u2013798 MHz ranges. Congress wantedto ensure first responders even in remote areas could have access to the network and requiredto expand FirstNet into rural areas where there was little to no wireless coverage.In October 2024,said that the FirstNet network supports more than 6.4 million connections and 29,000 public safety agencies.initially struggled with 5G deployment as it didn't have a lot of low-band spectrum. Instead, the carrier used a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) which allows it to run 5G on the same spectrum bands as LTE (also uses DSS in some of its low-band spectrum).However, this approach turned out to be bad news as it didn't give a boost to customers' download speeds as much.Meanwhile,also launched 5G on its C-band spectrum, which it bought for $52 billion during an auction in 2021.But it's not that easy for rural areas. There,focused on gaining access to spectrum through acquisitions and purchased many of its roaming partners: Bluegrass Cellular in 2020 (in Kentucky), Blue Mobility (New York and Pennsylvania), Triangle Mobile (Montana), and Chariton Valley Communications Corp in 2021 (Missouri). Unfortunately forthough, these purchases helped it expand its 4G, not its 5G.So,is forced to rely on its C-band spectrum for rural coverage.is also likely to spend around $1 billion to acquire more spectrum (850 MHz, AWS and PCS) from USCellular: we don't know where these licenses are located yet, but it may be focused on suburban and rural areas.Ookla's report also found that Wyoming is the only state to have the lowest 5G Availability for all three carriers. This is probably due to its low population density though. Being the 10th largest state in the US, expanded across 97.813 square miles, it's huge but its population is centered in just a few cities: Cheyenne, Casper, Laramie and Gillette. However,has beaten the other two here as well.There are two lucky states two: Nevada and Illinois. Obviously, Las Vegas is in Nevada, and there's quite a lot of stuff going on there, so it makes sense carriers would want to show off the latest in wireless connectivity.Meanwhile, Chicago is also a huge market with its Magnificent Mile and United Center events venue.Luckily, that's not where the story ends. The FCC now has a 5G Fund for Rural America which would let it invest up to $9 billion to carriers to get 5G service to more people. So, we can safely expect coverage to grow even more in the near future. Awesome, if you ask me!",

While Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile remain the top players in the U.S., offering good coverage and expanding premium features becomes difficult in far-flung areas. T-Mobile has, however, left the other two big players behind when it comes to its 5G networks in rural areas, and it has achieved this through a number of strategic strategies.\n\nIf you live in a rural area of the U.S., you have nothing to worry about, as T-Mobile has you covered\n\nPeople in remote locations often struggle with limited carrier options and poor signals, but this is about to change. As per a new report by Ookla, T-Mobile seems to be leading when it comes to mobile coverage across the U.S., especially in rural areas. The report highlights how T-Mobile is able to extend reliable coverage to these far-flung areas when networks or services are often compromised through the widespread 5G network it has established.\n\nWhile 5G served to be a game-changer for people in urban areas, rural areas have not been able to reap the benefits of the service. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile were all set to bring better coverage to these areas, but T-Mobile has taken everyone by surprise with its aggressive approach, which has led to the company reaching in a better way and performing greatly in comparison to the competition.\n\nThis has been made possible due to the company's extensive deployment of low-band and mid-band 5G networks offering better coverage and reliability than the rest. Due to this strategic direction, the company has the largest percentage of users on 5G networks in both urban and rural markets. T-Mobile's 5G strategy can be termed methodical, as it leverages the 600MHz low-band spectrum for Extended Range 5G and is able to offer broader coverage as a result.\n\nIt was mainly the Sprint acquisition in 2020 that served as a game-changer, allowing the company to get into the 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum and offer even better speed and service. Due to T-Mobile's Ultra Capacity 5G, the company now covers around 300 million people across the U.S. The telecommunication service provider is not going to stop here as it has an upcoming $4.4 billion acquisition of US cellular spectrum and customers, which would help extend its services to more areas with access to 4.5 million customers and retail stores.\n\nWhile other big players are also determined to escalate their rural efforts, it seems that T-Mobile has a tight grip on 5G dominance with its strategy and ability to manage both speed and range.",

Her solution involves small, solar-powered robots that use wire meshes to collect harmful algae blooms, release oxygen through air stones to combat oxygen depletion, and utilise zeolite biofilters to absorb excess nutrients, thereby preventing further eutrophication.\n\nThe key selling point is its self-sustaining business model. The collected algae will be sold to businesses that convert them into biofuels and other sustainable products, creating a revenue stream to fund more robots. This approach not only restores aquatic ecosystems but also fosters sustainability and generates economic value.\n\nAleksandra\u0092s solution also aligns with the UN SDG 14: Life Below Water, promoting ecological restoration and sustainability.\n\nLuisanny Martinez - Skomby by Tex\n\nSkomby by Tex is a solution to modern challenges in fashion and sustainability that offers a sustainable, biodegradable material made from kombucha fermentation by-products. The eco-friendly alternative to traditional leather and textiles is crafted from bacterial cellulose, offering a lightweight, durable, and unique texture.\n\nThe material is 100% biodegradable and compostable, and can even be reused as planting capsules. To further enhance the sustainable model of the business, the team uses natural dyes like turmeric, spirulina, and saffron, ensuring no toxic chemicals are involved.\n\nSkomby by Tex collaborates with local kombucha producers in order to reduce waste and emissions. Luisanny\u0092s long-term vision is to scale production while maintaining low-impact manufacturing practices, such as sun drying and ambient-temperature fermentation.\n\nMarta Bernardino - Trovador\n\nThe precision reforestation market is projected to reach $9.77 billion by 2033, growing at a 5.74% CAGR, with high demand from the private sector. Recognising a billion-dollar opportunity, Marta developed Trovador, a reforestation robotics company that combats climate change by planting trees in hard-to-reach areas. Unlike drones, which have a low survival rate for seeds, Trovador\u0092s hexapod robots plant saplings with a 90% survival rate. These AI-driven robots navigate challenging terrains like cliffs and slopes, ensuring effective reforestation.\n\nTrovador\u0092s unique hexapod design preserves essential soil conditions for sapling survival and operates autonomously, overcoming obstacles in real-time. This innovative approach supports sustainability by providing rural communities with a safe, efficient reforestation solution, aligning with several UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe service is quite simple and self-explanatory: clients select the planting site, the robot is deployed, and reforestation is monitored remotely. With just \u00a32.5 (\u00803) per tree, Trovador is 30% more affordable than traditional methods, while excelling in speed, safety, and sustainability.\n\nSebastiaan Schalkwijk - Solar Sub\n\nSolar Sub\u0092s floating solar solution revolutionises renewable energy by placing solar panels on water bodies, maximising land use and harnessing natural cooling. This approach enhances system efficiency, increasing energy yield by up to 27% compared to traditional solar systems.\n\nSolar Sub\u0092s advanced cooling technology and optimal panel positioning improve efficiency and durability, reducing operational costs and extending the lifespan of solar installations. This innovation sets Solar Sub apart from competitors facing issues with panel overheating and degradation.\n\nSebastiaan adopts a licensing business model which allows rapid scaling without significant capital investment. This reduces upfront costs and risks, enabling us to focus on strategic partnerships. His model has gained traction with support from key industry players, confirming market interest and feasibility.\n\nZain Sumdani - Exoheal\n\nExoheal addresses the global shortage of physiotherapists and the inaccessibility of effective therapy with a robotic glove and a machine-learning-powered app. This solution delivers personalised, real-time therapy, enabling stroke recovery from home. Early trials show a 50% improvement in recovery time compared to traditional methods.\n\nExoheal app connects patients with hospitals and clinics, allowing remote monitoring and real-time feedback. Its modular design and scalable production ensure affordability and the ability to meet global demand.\n\nBy 2028, Zain and his team aim to transform 100,000 lives, saving governments $178 million in healthcare costs and enabling $16 million in inpatient earnings.\n\nFor more information on the Young Entrepreneurs Challenge visit: youngentrepereneurschallenge.com\n\nAbout Unloc\n\nUnloc was founded in 2013 by award-winning young leaders and advocates Hayden Taylor and Ben Dowling.

Before, when we used only physical SIM, the phone had to specifically have trays focused on that, and not many did. However, eSIM entered the scene - a new tech allowing you to have a digital SIM instead of a physical one. And we also got, as a consequence, the convenience of Dual eSIM.Many modern phones support it. Apple started offering dual eSIM with the iPhone 13 , while the Galaxy S24 introduced it to Galaxy phones (before, you could use eSIM + physical SIM). It's becoming more widespread and now, thanks to this cool feature, you don't need to carry two physical phones or have two physical SIM cards: one for work and the other for your personal contacts.Well, some users have been dealing with struggles when it comes to this convenient option with Verizon , and unfortunately, it appears the carrier isn't exactly pressed to help. User s0uthernlights on Reddit shares their nightmarish story about trying to use dual eSIM on their new (unlocked) iPhone 15 Pro . Dual SIM apparently worked perfectly on their iPhone 12 Pro with one physical SIM and one eSIM, but things haven't gone as planned since they upgraded.The user's done all sensible troubleshooting, from resetting network settings and the phone, to calling both Apple andlooking for ways to solve the issue. The problem they're facing: well, dual eSIM doesn't really work as it should. They cannot switch between calls: for incoming calls, if they're talking on one line, the other line's call goes straight to voicemail.The user also indicates that the issue has been outrageously unresolved for around five months. Other users have chimed in, sharing they were facing similar issues, with one person receiving a dreaded answer to exchange the phone at a store after a long 4-hour chat with alive agent.The user who started the thread is facing an annoying and disruptive problem to such a degree that they seem to even be considering switching their carrier to. It seems both their eSIMs were on, and they are now even thinking of changing one (or maybe both?) toIn the meantime, Apple's support article on using Dual SIM indicates the following:Hopefully, the issue will be resolved soon, as it looks like it has taken way too long for the affected users, with some being forced to time-travel back to, what, the year 2000, and carry two physical phones everywhere they go.",

            "content": "Verizon Business, the enterprise division of the $134 billion US telecom giant Verizon Communications, has been operational in the Indian market for over two decades. The company views India as a key market in global and Asia-Pacific arenas, particularly with the country's significant digital transformation over the past 4-5 years, marked by increased adoption of cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and enterprise 5G. However, as digital transformation accelerates, cybersecurity threats, particularly AI-driven attacks, are becoming more sophisticated. In an interview with TechCircle during his visit to India this week, Rob Le Busque, Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific, explains India's role in Verizon's growth strategy, the future of cybersecurity as well as the company's efforts to secure enterprises\u2019 cloud migration in the APAC region. Edited excerpts:\n\nAs a long-time Verizon veteran, how have you seen the company evolve over the past decade, particularly in the last 4-5 years since you took on a new role?\n\nThe tech sector in Asia Pacific has seen significant changes, especially in cybersecurity, with a rise in targeted phishing and ransomware attacks at both individual and organisational levels, partly due to Covid-19. We've also noted an increase in data exfiltration and exposure attacks, as cybercriminals and their tools have become more advanced, with these trends intensifying annually. Another major shift is the evolution of network architecture to support distributed workforces and workloads. Covid-19 accelerated remote work, cloud adoption, and application migration, which impacts security, network, and customer experience architectures. Recently, enterprise customers have increasingly adopted distributed network architectures, prompting new technologies, security considerations, work practices, and funding models for CIOs and CTOs.\n\nHow do you view the intersection of security and cloud adoption? What kind of workloads are companies migrating to the cloud?\n\nThese trends are evident globally and in the Asia Pacific region, with a consistent pattern across the technology ecosystem. Cybersecurity threats are global, enabling cybercriminals to target individuals and companies in India, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. Both globally and locally, cloud and application migrations are being pursued. However, in Asia Pacific, CIOs and CTOs adopt a more security-conscious approach to cloud migration. In the past two to three years, CIOs have consistently asked us two key questions: How can I securely move my applications to a hyperscale cloud environment? And how can I ensure that my network connectivity maintains a high-quality user experience?\n\nHow does India fit into Verizon's broader APAC growth strategy and at the global level?\n\nHaving operated in India for over 20 years, Verizon considers it a strategically important market, ranking as the second or third largest by revenue in Asia Pacific. Our commitment involves delivering services like distributed network architecture, cybersecurity capabilities, and our new AI Connect feature to customers worldwide. India presents significant investment opportunities in technology, infrastructure, and architecture. A positive development is the Indian government's recent budget allocation of over $250 million for cybersecurity initiatives, a notable increase from previous years. Additionally, India's economy is projected to grow by 6.6% in 2025, making it a trusted partner for American and European firms in technology investments. These factors position India as a crucial growth market for us in 2025 and beyond. Currently, we employ over 7,000 employees in India, highlighting its importance for core technology and business integration. We continue to invest in engineering and emerging technology resources, led by our Global AI Center of Excellence (CoE), which focuses on developing repeatable AI patterns and responsible generative AI deployment models for Verizon globally.\n\nHow does Verizon use GenAI to mitigate various risks and streamline operations?\n\nWe have established a central GenAI CoE and platform team that supports our global product teams in adopting GenAI responsibly. This initiative brings together cross-functional experts from IT, engineering, risk, legal, and finance to assist internal teams in building GenAI solutions. Our platform offers standard tools for creating reusable components and workflow recommendations, streamlining the process of generating value. A key feature of our CoE is the AI financial operations (FinOps) capability, which helps leaders and employees understand cost and value models for GenAI, facilitating better business decisions. We aim to ensure that technology adds value rather than detracts from it. Early indicators of success include reducing the production time for marketing materials from 15 days to five days and demonstrating significant improvements in agility and responsiveness to customer needs.\n\nWhich business segments are driving maximum growth and revenue in India and the APAC region?\n\nIn the Asia Pacific region, cybersecurity services have driven revenue growth, as the frequency of cyber-attacks continues to rise. Companies increasingly recognise the need for a global cybersecurity provider due to the global nature of these threats. Additionally, the demand for network capacity and computational power is surging, driven by generative AI's requirements for large data loads and rapid information movement. Technologies like 5G and edge computing are expanding the attack surface for cybersecurity, as more devices connect to networks, increasing vulnerability. Our AI Connect offering incorporates edge computing, emphasising security across all network aspects, not just cloud applications or mobile devices.\n\nWhat are Verizon's current plans involving its partnership ecosystem?\n\nWe are continuously expanding our partner ecosystem, collaborating with companies like HCL Tech and others globally. Our focus remains on identifying value-creating partnerships within the vendor and software community. In terms of competitor analysis, we are concentrating on growth areas that our customers are eager to explore. While generative AI is a key focus, we also consider the surrounding ecosystem, including new connectivity devices and applications. We aim to understand our customers' needs and craft tailored solutions that enable their growth.",

            "content": "Verizon is leveraging Ribbon\u2019s portfolio of Voice Products, including the vC20 Call Controller, G5 Line Access Gateway, G6 Universal Media Gateway, virtual and Cloud-native Session Border Controllers, and others. This allows for the consolidation and replacement of equipment with software-centric platforms while maintaining full feature functionality.\n\n\u201cThe Verizon Voice Network Modernization Project is a significant part of this major recovery,\u201d McClelland said. \u201cSales to this key customer accounted for 17% of overall company revenue in the fourth quarter and grew 80% in the second half of the year. The program's initial phase continues to ramp, and we're migrating approximately one voice switch every week and expect to scale further as the year progresses.\u201d\n\nNetwork modernization ramps\n\nWhile Ribbon will continue to ramp up its engagement with Verizon, the vendor is seeing network modernization sales increase with several other U.S. service providers.\n\nRibbon reported that overall network modernization sales grew 21% quarter-over-quarter for the quarter.\n\nRibbon\u2019s other network transformation deals included an IMS Mobile Core win and a cloud migration project with a European Tier 1 service provider, which McLelland said \u201chighlights the technology leadership we have in leveraging a cloud-native operational and software delivery model.\u201d\n\nHowever, the momentum is not just about Tier 1 service providers.\n\nAs more states receive funding allocations from the BEAD program, Ribbon sees an opportunity to provide network equipment, particularly to support rural providers deploying fiber-to-the-home (FTTH). Sales have risen 5% year over year.\n\nThis has driven Ribbon to enhance its rural-focused capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe're increasing our focus and investment in this area, adding additional resources to the sales organization and presales specialists,\u201d McClelland said. \u201cIt's also critical to establish strong relationships with the engineering firms that specialize in this area, and we've continued to expand our efforts here as well.\u201d\n\nAnother potential growth area for Ribbon will be with the over 200 Metaswitch customers. Microsoft sold the Metaswitch assets last fall to Alianza, which has positioned itself as a cloud communications platform for service providers.\n\nMcClelland said that the company\u2019s voice services capabilities could fit these customers well.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft's decision to sell that business to a small cloud platform provider does not give service providers much comfort that the future of their regulated on-premise lifeline voice platform is secure, and this is our sweet spot,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal opportunities abound\n\nWhile Ribbon has long been a supplier to the service provider community, the vendor is seeing continual growth in both the enterprise and the public sector segments.\n\nEnterprise currently accounts for 41% of Ribbon\u2019s revenue. During the quarter, Ribbon secured new deals with key financial services companies, such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, and others.\n\nMcClelland said it is looking to make it easier for enterprises to work with Ribbon.\n\n\u201cWe continue to transition customers to a flexible enterprise license agreement framework that simplifies their use of our software products and technical support services and provides better revenue predictability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect the fourth quarter to continue to be the strongest in the year as we renew these enterprise term license agreements and recognize significant revenue.\u201d\n\nBesides traditional enterprises, Ribbon continues to gain traction with public sector agencies, particularly U.S. Defense agencies.\n\nFederal government agency customer wins included expansion orders on a large voice network modernization project. The vendor also secured a customer win for a portable network-in-a-box communication platform that can be quickly deployed in a forward command and control environment.\n\n\u201cAs anticipated, we had a robust quarter with several new U.S. Defense agency awards,\u201d McClelland said. \u201cFor the full year, our business with U.S. federal agencies increased almost 150% year-over-year.\u201d\n\nCloud and Edge dominate results\n\nRibbon\u2019s Cloud & Edge business was a key star in its portfolio during the fourth quarter.\n\nDriven by strong sales to service providers, enterprises, and government agencies, the company reported that Cloud & Edge sales grew 35% yearly to $165 million. Full-year revenues were $505 million, which reflects a $28 million or 6% increase from 2023.\n\n\u201cThis was an excellent quarter for our Cloud & Edge business, with all aspects of the operation performing well,\u201d McClelland said. \u201cThe business is solidly diversified with approximately two-thirds of our sales to service providers and one-third to enterprise, federal, and defense customers.\u201d\n\nAlso, Ribbon\u2019s Services and Support business rose 5% to $294 million or 58% of revenues.\n\nAlternatively, Ribbon\u2019s IP Optical Networks business revenues declined 17% yearly to $87 million and 6% for the entire year to $329 million.",

Through a partnership between T-Mobile, SpaceX, and Starlink, a new satellite-to-cell service allows users to send and receive text messages even in areas without traditional network coverage.\n\nIn December 2024, T-Mobile launched a beta program for this satellite-powered messaging service, offering US customers early access at no extra cost. The program is still open for those who want to apply, making it easier than ever to stay connected-no cell towers required.\n\nRead more: T-Mobile Opens Its Starlink Beta, Including to People With AT&T and Verizon\n\nHowever, access is limited during the T-Mobile Starlink beta. If you're a T-Mobile customer living in the US, you must have an optimized phone, like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip 6, iPhone 16 or Google Pixel 9. During the Super Bowl, T-Mobile announced that AT&T, Verizon and other phone carrier customers can also try out T-Mobile Starlink satellite service for free, for a limited time.\n\nIf you're interested in trying out the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service and don't know where to start, here's everything you need to know.\n\nWatch this: Starlink Satellites Are Bringing Internet to Millions. We'll Explain the Pros and Cons 02:38\n\nWhat exactly is the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service and how does it work?\n\nIn August 2022, during a live event, T-Mobile and SpaceX announced Coverage Above and Beyond, a plan for bringing cellphone connectivity everywhere in the US, even in the most remote regions. T-Mobile's wireless network would leverage Starlink's direct-to-cell satellites -- more than 300 of them -- to provide \"near complete coverage\" to all 500,000 square miles in the US that are not covered by cell towers, essentially eliminating dead zones.\n\nIf you're in an area without cell service, like Yosemite National Park or the Grand Canyon, your phone will automatically connect to the nearest T-Mobile Starlink satellite, acting like a floating cellphone tower, to give you service, as long as there's nothing obstructing the connection between your phone and the sky.\n\nThis partnership has been years in the making. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nWhat can you do with the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service?\n\nYou can use the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service to send and receive text messages on your supported phone -- for free. That includes text messages to 911 in case of an emergency. Plans are in place to add support for picture messaging, voice calls, and data soon -- but for most users, it will come at a cost.\n\nEventually, you'll be able to surf the web with Starlink. James Martin/CNET\n\nWho can use the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service?\n\nRight now, you need to meet the following requirements if you want to use the Starlink satellite service on your phone:\n\nYou must be a T-Mobile customer (open to other customers now, too) . On T-Mobile's website, it says. \"Anyone -- on any carrier -- can register to participate in the beta.

T-Mobile/Screenshot by CNET\n\nCapacity is limited, so not everyone will get to join during the beta launch, but if you have an \"optimized\" phone, meaning a newer phone, you have a better chance of getting accepted. You should receive a notification via email or text when you're accepted into the program. As the program leaves the beta stage, which is expected to happen in July, more people will be able to join.\n\nHere's what else you should know about T-Mobile's Starlink satellite service\n\nSince the satellite-to-cell service is still in beta and invitations are rolling out gradually, here are answers to some common questions you might have:\n\nWhen will the free beta end? T-Mobile plans to end the free beta in July.\n\nT-Mobile plans to end the free beta in July. What will the price of the T-Mobile Starlink service be after the beta is finished? The service will continue to be free for users on the Go5G Next plan, but for every other T-Mobile customer, it will be $15 per month per line. If you signed up for the beta, you'll get an early adopter discount of $10 per month until February of next year.\n\nThe service will continue to be free for users on the Go5G Next plan, but for every other T-Mobile customer, it will be $15 per month per line.

(NYSE:VZ) stands against other low PE high dividend stocks to buy now.\n\nA low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio indicates that a stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings, presenting a potential buying opportunity for investors looking to acquire shares at a reasonable price. Stocks that combine low P/E ratios with high dividend yields tend to attract those seeking both value and steady income.\n\nOne of the reasons these investment strategies remain effective is their long history of delivering strong returns. Approaches centered on identifying undervalued stocks or prioritizing dividend-paying companies have consistently produced favorable results over time. Heartland Advisors referenced a study analyzing US stock returns from 1802 to 2002, which found that dividends and their growth contributed 5.8% to the total annualized return of 7.9% over the 200-year period. Similarly, research from the London Business School examined global returns from 1900 to 2005. The study found that across 17 countries, the average real return was approximately 5%, with an average dividend yield of 4.5% during that timeframe. These findings reinforce the appeal of long-term investment strategies focused on value and income generation.\n\nThe Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been largely driven by a small group of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies account for over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, in recent months, market leadership has shifted, with value-oriented stocks gaining momentum. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index climbed 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% gain of the Russell Growth Index, as reported by BlackRock.\n\nThe report further mentioned that several factors may have influenced this shift toward value stocks. Strong job growth, declining inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to begin cutting interest rates have boosted investor confidence, allowing the rally to extend beyond the largest mega-cap stocks. In addition, value-driven sectors that are sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014tend to benefit from a lower rate environment.\n\nThough value outperformed growth in the third quarter of 2024, recent market trends have overwhelmingly favored growth and technology stocks, leading to a decline in the representation of value stocks within US large-cap indexes. As of September 30, 2024, growth stocks comprised 32% of the Russell index, whereas value stocks accounted for only 8%, resulting in a notable 24% gap. This stands in contrast to the past 25 years, during which the average difference in market weight between growth and value stocks within the index was 7.4%.\n\nThis shift has inadvertently left many portfolios lacking diversification and underexposed to value stocks, potentially causing investors to miss out on gains as value stocks recover. To address this imbalance, investors may benefit from deliberately increasing their allocation to value stocks by complementing core US equity index funds with a dedicated value-focused investment strategy.\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed recently, largely due to the market\u2019s strong focus on AI-related stocks. As a result, their valuations have declined in recent months. When it comes to dividend investing, high yields often create uncertainty among investors, making it challenging to determine whether these stocks are worthwhile investments. Investors often gravitate toward stocks with high dividend yields, assuming that a higher yield automatically translates to better returns. However, a study by Wellington Management challenged this assumption, revealing that while stocks with the highest dividend payouts and yields performed well over time, they did not necessarily outperform those with moderately high, yet not extreme, dividend yields. This finding suggests that excessively high yields do not always lead to the best results, emphasizing the need for a more balanced approach rather than focusing solely on yield size. Analysts generally consider dividend yields in the range of 3% to 6% to be healthy.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile this list, we filtered for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio below 15 and dividend yields exceeding 5% as of February 16. From that group, we chose companies with a proven track record of consistently paying dividends to their shareholders. The ranking of these stocks is based on their forward P/E ratios, arranged from the highest to the lowest.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 8.77\n\nDividend Yield as of February 16: 6.61%\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company that provides a wide range of communication services to its consumers. The company\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings came in strong, with revenues amounting to $35.7 billion, up 1.6% from the same period last year. This growth was driven by a rise in customer additions across both mobile wireless and internet services. In the mobile wireless segment, the company added 568,000 net postpaid phone subscribers, an increase from 449,000 in the same quarter the previous year. Revenue from this segment grew 3.1% year-over-year to $20 billion, marking its 18th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has grabbed investors\u2019 attention due to its strong cash flow and commitment to innovation. In fiscal year 2024, it reported $37 billion in operating cash flow, while free cash flow rose to $19.8 billion from $18.7 billion the previous year. Analysts remain optimistic about its prospects, especially after partnering with NVIDIA to develop an AI-powered enterprise solution that enhances AI applications on its secure 5G private networks using private Mobile Edge Computing. Moreover, the company is pursuing other AI-driven initiatives, including network slicing and satellite connectivity, to expand revenue streams and strengthen its market position.\n\nDue to its strong cash generation, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was able to raise its payouts for 18 consecutive years, which places it on our list of the best dividend stocks. The company\u2019s quarterly dividend comes in at $0.6775 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.61%, as of February 16.\n\nOverall, VZ ranks 3rd on our list of low PE high dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Such options include AT&T and Frontier, both of which provide their customers with fast fiber connections, and Optimum and Spectrum, which offer reliable cable service.\n\nDallas customers have a range of budget-friendly internet plans to choose from. Astound Broadband stands out with its $20 monthly plan offering impressive 300 Mbps download speeds. However, be aware that the price will rise after the initial promotional period.\n\nBest internet in Dallas, Texas\n\nThere's a lot to love about Dallas, Texas -- the people, the sights, and, on a more personal level, my grandmother's mouthwatering barbecue, which we'd devour whenever my family would visit. But I'm here to talk about broadband, not smoked meat. Thankfully, Dallas has quite a few home internet options, too.\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available internet providers in Dallas\n\nMany other broadband choices exist in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area beyond our top three picks. Some are outside the Dallas city limits but can be found well within the immediate suburbs. Others may only be in small pockets farther away from the city center. In most cases, each provider offers something enticing, even with some glaring issues.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nAstound Broadband : This cable internet provider, known locally as Grande Communications but now part of parent company Astound Broadband, features some of DFW's most compelling and competitive promo rates. The starting price of $20 per month for a 300Mbps plan is a very affordable 6 cents per Mbps. In contrast, AT&T Fiber's 300Mbps plan clocks in at $55 per month. The same holds with Astound's fastest plan, a 1,500Mbps tier with a monthly promo price of $55. That's a stellar 3 cents per Mbps. Astound also features some of the steepest price increases in the industry. The Astound Broadband Texas rate card reveals that your 300Mbps plan could rise to $90 per month after your promo period. That's stark.\n\nThis cable internet provider, known locally as Grande Communications but now part of parent company Astound Broadband, features some of DFW's most compelling and competitive promo rates.

That's stark. Frontier Communications : Frontier features some solid serviceability in the northern portion of the Dallas metro area. You won't find any coverage in the city center. You can get its DSL and fiber-optic service in the northwest outskirts near Irving. Garland, which is just northeast of Dallas, you'll find coverage for 65% of households. If Frontier Fiber is available -- it features symmetrical plans of 200Mbps, 500Mbps, gigabit, 2Gbps or 5Gbps speeds ranging from $40 to $140 per month -- it's a very appealing choice. If Frontier DSL is your only option, you might want to keep looking.\n\nFrontier features some solid serviceability in the northern portion of the Dallas metro area.

If Frontier DSL is your only option, you might want to keep looking. Optimum : Let me be clear -- Suddenlink is the provider you're probably familiar with in Dallas. Its parent company, Altice USA, renamed it to Optimum. In any case, Optimum cable internet service can be mostly found east of Dallas in the Mesquite area, covering Balch Springs, Forney, Rockwall and Terrell. Optimum also supplies broadband service to some areas north of DFW, including Little Elm, Fairview and Prosper.\n\nLet me be clear -- Suddenlink is the provider you're probably familiar with in Dallas.

Satellite internet : Typically, if you live in a big metro area like Dallas, I wouldn't even broach the topic of satellite internet. You're bound to find more reliable connections, faster speeds and cheaper prices than are awaiting you with a satellite internet connection. DFW is a large area, and some on the rural periphery may not have the same options. While Hughesnet and Viasat are steady choices, both feature data restrictions. Starlink, Elon Musk's newer satellite provider on the block, is more intriguing as it features faster speeds and no contracts -- and the Starlink availability map shows availability for the Dallas-Fort Worth area (which wasn't the case in 2023).\n\nTypically, if you live in a big metro area like Dallas, I wouldn't even broach the topic of satellite internet.

Verizon 5G Home Internet: Verizon has been just as ambitious with its 5G home internet product as T-Mobile, although perhaps not quite as aggressive in pursuing rural communities. As such, Verizon fell short of our top list because it might not serve communities on the outskirts of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area as well as T-Mobile can. If you are serviceable for Verizon 5G Home Internet, you'll find faster speeds than T-Mobile (average of 300Mbps to T-Mobile's 72 to 245Mbps) and a similar, straightforward approach for $50-$70 per month, including no data caps, no contracts and no equipment fees. Also, customers can shave $15 to $25 off their monthly bill if they have a qualifying Verizon mobile plan.\n\nValerie Macon/Getty Images\n\nCheap internet options in Dallas\n\nThe average starting price for internet service in Dallas is approximately $46 per month, but a few providers offer plans cheaper than that. The absolute lowest starting price you can find currently belongs to Astound Broadband. It features a 300Mbps plan with a promo price of $20 per month.\n\nResidents in downtown Dallas won't be able to get Astound's cheap internet, but serviceability reaches out to Flower Mound, Frisco, Fairview, Little Elm and McKinney.\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet plan in Dallas?\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow to find internet deals and promotions in Dallas\n\nThe best internet deals and top promotions in Dallas depend on what discounts are available during that time. Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers.\n\nDallas internet providers, such as Astound Broadband and Optimum, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Others, including AT&T, Frontier and Verizon, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nHow fast is Dallas broadband?\n\nDallas disappoints when you compare its home internet speeds to some of the other top cities in the US. The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan area boasts the country's fourth-largest population, but according to Ookla's most recent reporting, Dallas managed only a 98th-place finish among the 100 most populated cities in the US. That puts it right behind Seattle and just above Detroit and Atlanta. This may seem competitive, but it's well behind other Texas towns such as Austin, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Fort Worth and San Antonio -- all of which made the top 15. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nFastest internet plans in Dallas\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Dallas\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We use the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answers to those questions are often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our page on how we test ISPs.\n\nWhat's the final word on internet providers in Dallas?\n\nAs we like to say in our CNET home internet reviews, fiber internet trumps cable broadband almost every time. So if you have access to any of the AT&T Fiber plans -- or, if you're in the suburbs, Frontier Fiber -- that will be your best bet. Cable providers like Spectrum, Astound, and Optimum offer reliable connections and plenty of fast plans to suit just about any household. Be sure to avoid data caps, and if you're serviceable for providers like AT&T or Frontier, ensure you can get their fiber plans and don't have to settle for a slower, spottier DSL connection.\n\nDallas internet provider FAQs\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Dallas? If you're looking for the cheapest service in Dallas, Astound Broadband's option of 300Mbps for $20 per month is the absolute lowest you can pay monthly. Just beware of a steep price jump after the promo period ends. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet service available in Dallas? Yes. Several internet providers offer fiber connections within the greater Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metro area. AT&T and Frontier have the fastest plans, each with 5Gbps and 7 Gbps tiers, respectively, and symmetrical speeds. One thing to note is that each of those ISPs also has DSL plans, so do your homework to ensure you're getting their fiber offering and not DSL. Show more",

            "content": "The S&P 500 is near its all-time high. The deadline for funding the U.S. government is rapidly approaching with no budget deal finalized yet. Inflation rose more than expected in January. Many economists predict that President Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to increase even more.\n\nAm I selling stocks hand over fist in light of all the uncertainty? Nope. Here's why I've backed the truck and loaded up on these three high-yield dividend stocks.\n\n1. Honda Motor\n\nIf I were focused only on the near term, I might not touch shares of Honda Motor (HMC 2.05%) with a 10-foot pole. The auto stock is down 20% over the last 12 months. Honda's planned acquisition of Nissan fell through. Tariffs could negatively impact the company, too.\n\nHowever, I think Honda's long-term prospects remain strong. The 2024 Axios Harris Poll 100 ranked Honda as the most reputable vehicle brand in the U.S. market. Honda's brand came in seventh place overall in the survey. Like its vehicles and power equipment, Honda is built to last.\n\nThere are reasons to like Honda in the short term, too. Its forward dividend yield of 5.15% is a big plus for the stock. The company is also committed to stock buybacks, recently repurchasing nearly 121.5 million shares.\n\nI also suspect that tariffs won't hurt Honda as much as some expect. President Trump paused his planned 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico. If this delay becomes permanent (which I think is likely), Honda's shares could rebound since around 80% of the company's vehicles made in Mexico are sold in the U.S.\n\n2. Prudential Financial\n\nI also recently got a bigger piece of the rock and added to my position in Prudential Financial (PRU 3.28%). It gives me comfort knowing the financial services company has been in business for over 145 years and is still going strong.\n\nThis longevity isn't the main reason I invested more in Prudential, though. I like the stock's valuation with shares trading below 7.6 times forward earnings. That's much lower than the average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.4 for the S&P 500 financial sector.\n\nI'd be lying if I said Prudential's juicy forward dividend yield of 4.87% wasn't enticing. So is the company's track record of 17 consecutive years of dividend increases. Prudential's stock buybacks (almost $3 billion last year) add to the attraction.\n\nCould President Trump's focus on deregulation help Prudential? The chances look pretty good to me. The first Trump administration lifted Prudential from extensive government oversight as a systemically important financial institution. I wouldn't be surprised if the company benefits from further relaxation of regulations in Trump's second term.\n\n3. Verizon Communications\n\nI'll readily admit that I bought more shares of Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%) largely because of its dividend program. The telecommunications giant has increased its dividend for 18 consecutive years. Verizon's forward dividend yield stands at 6.7%, which gives it a big head start in delivering double-digit percentage total returns.\n\nValuation was another key consideration. Verizon's shares trade at below 8.7 times forward earnings, which is significantly cheaper than the multiple of top rival AT&T.\n\nImportantly, Verizon's business is strong. Total broadband connections jumped 15% year over year during Q4. Wireless service revenue rose 3.1% year over year in Q4, marking 18 consecutive quarters of sequential growth.\n\nI also think artificial intelligence (AI) is important to Verizon's growth strategy. The company is using AI to increase its operational efficiency and boost profitability. It's offering AI tools to personalize customer experiences. Edge AI apps running close to the edge of networks could also provide a major tailwind for Verizon. CEO Hans Vestberg said in the Q4 earnings call that edge AI \"has already created an opportunity for us as we had revenue and EBITDA impact in the fourth quarter.\"",

            "content": "Smartwatches for kids have become hugely popular among families who want to stay in touch with their children remotely and help little ones stay safer while keeping screen time to a minimum. An easy tool that travels wristwatch-style with a child, it helps you stay connected with kids ages 3 \u2013 11 without providing them a smartphone.\n\nBut as a futurist, parent and author of \u201cParenting High-Tech Kids,\u201d I often remind families that the best smartwatch for kids not only brings families closer together and gives kids more room to roam, but also offers other features in addition to calling and GPS trackers. Adding a line to your Verizon plan for your child's first connected device, like a smartwatch or the Gizmo Watch 3, is more than just a technical upgrade\u2014it's a big step toward their independence.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll review kids watches with smart capabilities, the ways the underlying technologies work and why a great smartwatch for kids can be an essential training tool for your children.\n\nWhat do kids smartwatches do?\n\nFeatures vary from product to product, but generally, a smartwatch for kids makes calls and sends texts to a pre-approved list of contacts. Verizon\u2019s Gizmo Watch 3 also uses GPS so parents can check the app on their phone to find out if their kid made it on that first walk to a friend\u2019s house or to a nearby playground.\n\nAside from being simple to set up and use, the best smartwatch for kids should boast added features such as games, fitness trackers, alarms and reminders. It should also feature a touch screen and an emergency contact option. Some kids\u2019 smartwatches may also offer video-calling or videoconferencing capabilities.\n\nHere\u2019s what many of today\u2019s kids smartwatches can do at a glance:\n\nWireless audio and/or video calling\n\nTexts and voice notes\n\nParental controls (aka safety controls)\n\nGPS location tracking\n\nGeo-fencing (boundary setting) with real-time alerts\n\nApps and games\n\nAlarms\n\nReminders\n\nStep counters\n\nTo-do or task lists\n\nWhy a smartwatch for kids may be the best smartphone alternative for a first device\n\nIf your child is too young or not ready for a cellphone, a smartwatch can be a great smartphone alternative. That\u2019s because smartwatches can serve as training wheels of sorts when it comes to connected technology for kids. Parental controls limit whom the child can text, call or send photos to, along with other helpful features like easy-to-review messaging and call history. This can provide a great way to introduce children to the world of technology while limiting their web exposure.\n\nFour things to seek in a smartwatch for kids\n\nEvery family has different needs, but for ages 3 \u2013 11 (the general age range for a kid-friendly smartwatch), there are four key features parents should seek:\n\n1. GPS tracking\n\nAmong the most important capabilities that many units offer are GPS trackers for kids that provide real-time location options so that parents can stay aware of their children\u2019s movements. With these watches, you can also set up geo-fencing to establish GPS boundaries\u2014such as a school or a friend\u2019s house in your neighborhood\u2014and alert parents or caregivers when the child crosses those boundaries. For many parents, the ability to locate their child when they\u2019re on the move is a priority. Plus, if your kid loses track of the device from time to time, GPS makes it easy to find it, much like the Find My Phone feature on your smartphone.\n\n2. Safety features\n\nAs with any device created for young children, check the device\u2019s parental controls for the ability to limit access to the internet and whom they can message, and make sure the device is protected with a strong PIN or password. Likewise, you\u2019ll want to configure any privacy settings, usually found in device settings menus or individual apps, to minimize the amount of information that you\u2019re sharing with smartwatch makers and third-party application creators.\n\nThe best smartwatch for kids will likely offer two-way communications capabilities, so you\u2019ll also want to teach children when and where it\u2019s appropriate to use such a device, how to communicate respectfully and with whom it\u2019s okay to speak. It may also offer SOS or \u201cpanic mode\u201d features, complete with alarms, GPS alerts, and automatic audio or video recording. You\u2019ll want to teach kids how to use these features responsibly.\n\nFor safety\u2019s sake, you may wish to choose a kids watch model that limits connectivity to websites, social media networks and the internet at large.\n\n3. Durability\n\nConsider how durable or waterproof a device is, noting that it will travel with kids as they play and go about their day. Kids may forget to charge their devices at regular intervals, making it important to pick a model with long battery life and a sturdy charger. An intuitive user interface is also important, as an easy-to-use unit will make it simpler for kids to use and stay in touch. Screen size is worth keeping in mind as well, as it makes reminders and notifications more obvious, on screen alerts and buttons easier to select, and information easier to read.",

Free Samsung Galaxy S25 with new line\n\nFree Google Pixel 9 with new line\n\nGet up to $830 off iPhone 16 Pro with trade-in\n\n$540 trade-in bonus or free smartwatch\n\nVerizon Home Internet plans get free year of Netflix and Max\n\nAccessory bundle with new Samsung S25 for $100\n\nSave $100 on Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro Check them all out here.\n\nIt would be worth it for customers who only have four devices if they all qualify for the $9 rate plus taxes with Xfinity, for example.\n\nThat comes out to what would likely be around $40, a savings of $28 in comparison to the new increased price from Verizon for four to 20 devices with the Mobile Protect Multi-Device plan.\n\nStill, add devices or keep the same amount of devices at the $19 rate, and customers might pay more than Verizon.\n\nEither way, this is the second price hike from Verizon in about two months.\n\nPAY UP\n\nIn December, the company implemented a 20-cent increase, with users paying $3.50 per voice line and $1.60 per data line, according to what Verizon spokesperson George Koroneos confirmed to The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Starting December 18, the monthly Verizon wireless Administrative and Teleco Recovery Charge will increase by $0.20 per line for mobile voice (basic phones, Second Number, smartphones, etc.) and data-only (hotspots, tablets, etc.) products,\" Koroneos said.\n\n\"Verizon Home Internet services are not affected.\"\n\nAmid the increase, customers were furious in a thread on Reddit.\n\n\"The Greed is insane,\" someone commented.\n\n\"They'll see when everybody moves to another carrier that they're not that great,\" another raged.\n\nVerizon also caught backlash after a different price uptick in October.\n\nSome customers also got a check from the company after a $100 million settlement.",

From March 27, 2025 going forward, the Verizon Mobile Protect Multi-Device price will jump from $60 to $68 per month on accounts with 4-20 lines.\n\nImportant: The monthly charge for Verizon Mobile Protect Multi-Device (4-20 lines) is increasing to $68/month on 3/27/25. There is no change in the monthly charge for Verizon Mobile Protect Multi-Device 2 and 3.\n\nSo, those on Verizon\u2019s most important plans (myPlan) with 5 lines or more and who might pay $60 extra per month to protect those, will be hammered with two price increases within the first three months of the year.\n\nQuite the start to 2025 here for Verizon.\n\n// Verizon [PDF]",

            "content": "If you initially brushed aside the Palm Pre Plus or the Palm Pixi Plus for another phone, you might want to reconsider your choice after you hear this latest bit of news from Verizon Wireless.\n\nThursday, Verizon dropped the price of its Mobile Hotspot monthly charge to $0. Yes, that TMs right. This gives you a 3G broadband modem on the Pre Plus or Pixi Plus for up to five devices for $60 less than you TMd pay for a MiFi or $50 less than any other tether-capable Verizon handset.\n\nIt TMs widely known that Verizon has been having trouble selling Palm phones. Palm TMs stock has plummeted 60 percent this year. With today TMs announcement, the stock actually has risen five percent.\n\nTo sweeten the deal, Verizon is selling the Palm Pre Plus for $49.99. The Pixi Plus is now $29.99.\n\nWhile it seemed that Apple and Droid appeared to be waiting for Palm to fold, this might actually be the spark that the Verizon needs to get sales of the Pre Plus moving forward.\n\nThis review highlights the Palm Pre Plus, but I TMll mention the Pixi Plus throughout, as well.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Pre Plus is actually a very nice phone. It has an outstanding display, a rugged build, call quality is top notch and its touch screen is very responsive.\n\nThe three biggest changes from the original Palm Pre are a new touch screen button to replace the tactile front button, the matted inductive-charging-capable back plate and the improved keyboard.\n\nThe new touch screen button on the front gives the Pre Plus a flat, sleek design. It was a no-brainer, as far as design is concerned.\n\nThe inductive backing comes standard on the Pre Plus and allows you to charge the phone wirelessly, if you choose. The charger will cost you about $50.\n\nThe keyboard feels less mushy on the Pre Plus. While it TMs small and took awhile to get used to, it was relatively easy to type on the Pre Plus.\n\nThe camera and flash are on the back. On top, you'll find the power button, silent ringer switch and a 3.5mm headphone jack. A Micro-USB port is on the right side.\n\nI wasn TMt crazy about the location or the friendliness of the on/off switch. It TMs tough to reach because it TMs so small. Also, I think I TMd like the device better if it had a visual keyboard to compliment the tactile one.\n\nMobile Hotspot application\n\nThis feature allows you to turn the Pre Plus or Pixi Plus into a mobile Wi-Fi router that can provide a mobile broadband connection on up to five devices.\n\nThe app is easy to use. Start the app, set a password and turn on tethering. Any Wi-Fi device (laptops, phones) can connect to it as you would any other hotspot.\n\nI was surprised by the fast speeds when I was testing this feature. I thought that it would surely slow to a crawl by adding multiple devices. But, it didn't. I had an iPhone, an iPod Touch and my MacBook Pro running on it and it performed quite well. I felt that it was faster using the Pre Plus as a wifi device instead of launching the phone's browser and surfing that way. Call me crazy, but that's how it felt.\n\nPreviously, I was bummed by the $40 price tag for this feature. But, as mentioned before, Verizon is waiving the charge altogether.\n\nOther tidbits of information\n\nBattery: The Palm Pre Plus's battery is user-replaceable. If you TMll be using the device extensively, you might want to have an extra battery on hand. If you run the mobile hot spot app, be sure to have your charger or another battery.\n\nLong boot time: Multitasking with the Pre Plus and switching between apps is pleasantly fast. If you have eight or nine apps open at once, the Pre Plus doesn TMt even hiccup. The Pixi Plus does struggle at that point, probably because of a lack of RAM. The Linux-based OS does take approximately two minutes to boot. This was particularly frustrating because I haven TMt seen a phone take this long to boot in some time. But, if you keep it charged and on all the time, you'll rarely have to reboot the phone.\n\nFlash support: At the time of this review, Flash was not supported on the Palm OS. And, while the Palm OS app store doesn TMt have as many apps as Droid or iPhone, it has enough to be productive.\n\nMusic: Amazon, not Rhapsody or iTunes (Apple blocks this).\n\nSpeaker: While call quality was superb, the speakerphone seemed a little weak.\n\nOther specs: 3.5 mm headphone jack, 3 megapixel camera with flash, users can import contact and calendar information from Google or an Exchange Server; iCal or Address Book on the Mac; or Palm Desktop or Outlook in Windows.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI TMve always liked Palm, ever since the days of the first Palm Pilot devices. I owned two of them. Their new OS (based on Linux) is user friendly and it works well with Macs or PCs.\n\nWhile it won TMt replace my iPhone, the new incentive of having a wireless hotspot at my disposal while on the road makes me stand up and take notice. My wife has been having some issues with her current Verizon phone and this might be a great solution for a replacement. Saving $50-60 to ditch the laptop TMs air card sounds like a great idea to me. If nothing else, give it a second look while shopping for your next smart phone.",

Through a partnership between T-Mobile, SpaceX, and Starlink, a new satellite-to-cell service allows users to send and receive text messages even in areas without traditional network coverage.\n\nIn December 2024, T-Mobile launched a beta program for this satellite-powered messaging service, offering US customers early access at no extra cost. The program is still open for those who want to apply, making it easier than ever to stay connected-no cell towers required.\n\nRead more: T-Mobile Opens Its Starlink Beta, Including to People With AT&T and Verizon\n\nHowever, access is limited during the T-Mobile Starlink beta. If you're a T-Mobile customer living in the US, you must have an optimized phone, like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip 6, iPhone 16 or Google Pixel 9. During the Super Bowl, T-Mobile announced that AT&T, Verizon and other phone carrier customers can also try out T-Mobile Starlink satellite service for free, for a limited time.\n\nIf you're interested in trying out the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service and don't know where to start, here's everything you need to know.\n\nWatch this: Starlink Satellites Are Bringing Internet to Millions. We'll Explain the Pros and Cons 02:38\n\nWhat exactly is the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service and how does it work?\n\nIn August 2022, during a live event, T-Mobile and SpaceX announced Coverage Above and Beyond, a plan for bringing cellphone connectivity everywhere in the US, even in the most remote regions. T-Mobile's wireless network would leverage Starlink's direct-to-cell satellites -- more than 300 of them -- to provide \"near complete coverage\" to all 500,000 square miles in the US that are not covered by cell towers, essentially eliminating dead zones.\n\nIf you're in an area without cell service, like Yosemite National Park or the Grand Canyon, your phone will automatically connect to the nearest T-Mobile Starlink satellite, acting like a floating cellphone tower, to give you service, as long as there's nothing obstructing the connection between your phone and the sky.\n\nThis partnership has been years in the making. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nWhat can you do with the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service?\n\nYou can use the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service to send and receive text messages on your supported phone -- for free. That includes text messages to 911 in case of an emergency. Plans are in place to add support for picture messaging, voice calls, and data soon -- but for most users, it will come at a cost.\n\nEventually, you'll be able to surf the web with Starlink. James Martin/CNET\n\nWho can use the T-Mobile Starlink satellite service?\n\nRight now, you need to meet the following requirements if you want to use the Starlink satellite service on your phone:\n\nYou must be a T-Mobile customer (open to other customers now, too) .

Davis and his brother used to build robots from kits as young kids. \u201cI was just so curious about, \u2018how does it move, how does it work?\u2019\u201d Davis says. \u201cHow does it know which way is left and right?\u201d\n\nBut Davis\u2019s enthusiasm for computer science truly blossomed after he attended Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers at Howard University in 2018 and University of the District of Columbia (UDC) in 2019, when he was a middle school student. Right away, Davis says, he was hooked by the program\u2019s curriculum \u2014 and his first chance to wear a virtual reality (VR) headset. \u201cI saw robots, I saw VR goggles, and I saw everyone having fun, everyone learning,\u201d he says.\n\nDavis had hands-on experience with emerging technologies combined with the opportunity to apply them in solving real-world problems. From developing medical wearables that transmit vital health information in emergencies, to creating practical solutions for addressing climate change, the students collaborated to tackle urgent global challenges\u2014an experience that profoundly shaped Davis\u2019s vision for his future. \u201cI had never really thought about solving real-world problems,\u201d Davis reflects. \u201cI was focused on building robots or creating machines, but I didn\u2019t fully grasp the bigger picture until I joined this program.\u201d\n\nThe Howard University program, run by Dr. Kofi LeNiles, combines the tech-based, hands-on learning of the Verizon Innovative Learning program with university-specific values, with an aim of not just teaching tech, but also creating bonds between the students. \u201cWhat makes this program at Howard unique is that we not only focus on the excellent STEM curriculum that Verizon provides, but we also focus on community,\u201d LeNiles explains.\n\nBy transforming competition into teamwork, the program teaches valuable lessons. \u201cMy biggest takeaway from the Verizon Innovative Learning program was how teamwork can solve issues,\u201d Davis explains. \u201cWe really got together and put our ideas together and\u2026 wrote it down and started brainstorming; we came up with some really good ideas.\u201d\n\nAs a graduating high school senior, Davis is already focused on potential possibilities for his future. \u201cMy interest in STEM got me thinking about solving problems\u2026 and I feel like it really contributed to my future interest, because everything I do is about solving a problem or fulfilling a need,\u201d he says. Davis has plenty to keep him busy: he is already an entrepreneur with his own clothing line and plans to go to college and pursue electrical contracting as a trade.\n\nVerizon Innovative Learning is a key part of the company\u2019s responsible business plan to help move the world forward for all. As part of the plan, Verizon has an ambitious goal of providing 10 million youth with digital skills training by 2030. Educators can access free lessons, professional development, and immersive learning experiences to help bring new ways of learning into the classroom by visiting Verizon Innovative Learning HQ.\n\nMy interest in STEM got me thinking about solving problems\u2026 and I feel like it really contributed to my future interest, because everything I do is about solving a problem or fulfilling a need...

            "content": "Brightspeed is teaming up with Verizon to launch fixed wireless access (FWA) for its copper customers\n\nVerizon will supply data services, however users won\u2019t be tied to a single carrier for voice capabilities\n\nMaintaining copper is expensive and fiber may not reach everyone\n\nIf you know anything about Brightspeed, it\u2019s been all about building fiber broadband. However, the operator must still contend with the sizable ILEC copper footprint it acquired from Lumen and figure out how to connect the customers who might have to wait years to get fiber \u2013 if at all.\n\nTo that end, Brightspeed is working toward the launch of a new fixed wireless access (FWA) service, which it announced in January in partnership with Verizon. Plans to use wireless as a copper replacement have been in the works since September, though at the time there was no mention of using Verizon for fixed wireless deployments.\n\nBrightspeed CEO Tom Maguire, who\u2019s notably a Verizon vet, told Fierce there are three different types of copper customers. Those who have fiber available in their area, in which case transitioning them off copper is \u201ca no brainer.\u201d There are copper customers who will have access to fiber in the future, but there's also the \u201cfiber maybe\u201d crowd. That\u2019s who he is concerned about. And that's where wireless technology comes into play.\n\nMaguire said Verizon years ago created a device called Voice Link, which used a wireless signal to emulate a dial tone. Voice Link came with a battery backup, so customers could use it when the copper network was down. The device supported copper-based Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), but did not offer internet data.\n\nOf course, that just won\u2019t fly in this day and age.\n\nSo, Brightspeed set out to find an alternative. Specifically, it wanted to create a copper replacement with both voice and data capabilities, not unlike AT&T\u2019s Phone Advanced, which is basically a wireless-based landline phone replacement.\n\nThere was just one problem: Brightspeed doesn\u2019t have its own mobile network. Enter Verizon.\n\nRelated Brightspeed can replace copper with unique wireless technology\n\nSimply put, the new FWA product is a 4G device with global eSIM capabilities, Brightspeed CTO Brian Bond told Fierce. Verizon will supply the internet data, but users won\u2019t be tied to a single carrier for phone and voice capabilities.\n\nWhen a customer boots up the device, it may default to one provider\u2019s network, say AT&T\u2019s. But depending on the area, \u201cit might say AT&T doesn\u2019t really have a great signal, it will try other carrier network[s] and then it\u2019ll lock on the best one,\u201d said Bond.\n\nBrightspeed also created an analog telephone adapter (ATA), which allows Brightspeed to \u201ccreate that dial-tone like experience\u201d for customers who want that. If a customer has a power outage, voice services will still work even if internet data is unavailable.\n\nThe FWA service is still in its pilot phase, but Brightspeed is aiming for general availability in the next couple of months. Thus far, Brightspeed is just offering voice services to a limited number of customers, but it is undertaking network upgrades so it can pair data with voice sometime in Q2 2025.\n\nCopper retirement is on the front burner\n\nBrightspeed\u2019s foray into fixed wireless comes as the new presidential administration is poised to tone down the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program\u2019s fiber preference. Amid the BEAD uncertainty, operators must grapple with their legacy copper networks.\n\nNew NTIA leadership is bound to make changes to the program to allow more room for alternative technologies. That means BEAD isn\u2019t a sure thing right now, Maguire said. And pending changes aside, providers are just not guaranteed to win all their BEAD applications. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to work that way,\u201d he said.\n\nMike Wendy, communications director at WISPA, is all for the type of copper replacement Brightspeed is offering.\n\n\u201cBrightspeed may even find their fiber plans aren\u2019t needed after they see what they can do with FWA and hear how happy their existing and new customers are with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I think this is the most likely outcome when the switch is made.\u201d\n\nAs for other non-wireless providers who are exploring FWA, Wendy mentioned Midco is \u201ca big proponent\u201d of the technology despite having an extensive cable footprint. \u201cI think they either use FWA to extend their cable plant footprint or to quickly compete in new areas adjacent to their cable plant,\u201d he said.\n\nBrightspeed seems to be charting a course like AT&T\u2019s to shed its copper network, said Wave7 Research principal Jeff Moore. Not only does AT&T have its Internet Air FWA product to connect customers not served by fiber, it\u2019s also been doubling down on its copper retirement strategy (despite some speedbumps).\n\nThe difference here is Brightspeed \u201cneeds to partner with Verizon to make this happen,\u201d Moore said. Interestingly, much of Brightspeed\u2019s service area falls under Sprint\u2019s legacy footprint, he added.\n\nFor Brightspeed\u2019s part, Maguire said he is \u201cpretty passionate\u201d about copper retirement. And for good reason, given Brightspeed and other telcos are plagued with the cost of copper maintenance, cable theft and regulations on when it can and can\u2019t switch off its copper network.\n\nBut the regulatory front is poised to shift, especially with Brendan Carr now at the helm of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a much different world\u2026just with the attitudes of people in terms of accepting alternative technologies,\u201d said Maguire.\n\nCarr has been a proponent of using satellite and other technologies over fiber for the BEAD program, though he\u2019s not directly involved with BEAD. He does have influence over copper retirement regs for carriers, as New Street Research has noted. But thus far, he hasn\u2019t indicated any policy changes in that area.\n\nMaguire remains optimistic that Brightspeed can cut down the cost to maintain copper for a \u201cdwindling\u201d number of customers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really on the cusp of being able to do something that\u2019s going to significantly change the infrastructure in telecom \u2013 and in the entire country \u2013 for the better,\u201d he concluded.",

His prior convictions include vehicular assault (2021), reckless driving (2019), and multiple theft and assault charges dating back to 1999.\n\n\u201cAn important note \u2013 only a fraction of his cases came to King County prosecutors, and every felony case that has been referred to King County prosecutors was charged,\u201d KCPAO told South King Media.\n\nDue to Warter\u2019s extensive criminal history and multiple pending cases \u2013 including a separate burglary case filed in December 2024 \u2013 King County prosecutors have requested bail be set at $50,000. They also requested that he have no contact with Verizon Wireless, AT&T Wireless, Dish Wireless, or the cell tower property.\n\nAs of Feb. 11, Warter remained in custody at the King County Correctional Facility.\n\nHis next court appearance is scheduled for later this month.\n\nShare this:\n\nPost\n\n",

            "content": "So many of the wireless reports we see in recent years suggest that T-Mobile is close to lapping Verizon and AT&T when it comes to 5G networks. But there is one report we can rely on to always tell somewhat of a different, sometimes-confusing story that typically puts AT&T on top of it all with Verizon there as the 5G reliability king, and T-Mobile pushing speeds to new heights. It\u2019s a report that allows everyone the opportunity to say, \u201cWe\u2019re the best!\u201d at something.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about the latest \u201cState of the Mobile Union Report\u201d from RootMetrics, after they crunched all of the numbers and data from the second half of 2024. Their key takeaways are that AT&T is the leader in national and state testing across several network categories, while Verizon has the \u201cbest\u201d overall 5G experience and is tops in most cities, and T-Mobile remains king of median download speeds and 5G availability.\n\nThe image above provides the cleanest look at what RootMetrics found through its extensive testing. It shows AT&T (from an overall network standpoint) mostly cleaning up in several categories, with Verizon winning others and coming in 2nd place in as many. T-Mobile, if you look at this image, appears to be far behind the others. Well, except for median download speeds, which T-Mobile is doubling the competition in.\n\nSo T-Mobile has more than doubled the median speed of AT&T and Verizon, yet ranks third in the speed category? Make it make sense, data folks.\n\nAnyways, here are the other takeaways:\n\nNational Scores : AT&T wins in overall performance\n\n: AT&T wins in overall performance State Scores : AT&T also wins in overall state performance; Verizon a close 2nd\n\n: AT&T also wins in overall state performance; Verizon a close 2nd City Scores: Verizon dominates in Metro Area scores\n\nThose are overall network scores and awards, but since the world only cares about 5G, here are the findings for 5G:\n\nBest 5G Experience : Verizon\n\n: Verizon Fastest 5G : Verizon\n\n: Verizon Most Reliable 5G : Verizon\n\n: Verizon Highest 5G Availability: T-Mobile\n\nThe takeaway? I just told you that AT&T won the overall network award, yet they didn\u2019t win a single 5G-related award, which is arguably the most important. T-Mobile, who doubled median speeds across the country, somehow also didn\u2019t win the 5G speed award, yet did win in 5G availability. Verizon took 3 of the awards, including the \u201cBest\u201d award where they apparently stood out by offering 5G in rural areas.\n\nTo recap, everyone is good.\n\n// RootMetrics",

So we wouldn't blame long term Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 30% over a half decade.\n\nSince shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Verizon Communications\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nLooking back five years, both Verizon Communications' share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 2.2% per year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 7% per year, over the period. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days. The low P/E ratio of 9.74 further reflects this reticence.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:VZ Earnings Per Share Growth February 12th 2025\n\nWe know that Verizon Communications has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Verizon Communications will grow revenue in the future.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Verizon Communications, it has a TSR of -7.2% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nVerizon Communications provided a TSR of 7.7% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. But at least that's still a gain! Over five years the TSR has been a reduction of 1.4% per year, over five years. It could well be that the business is stabilizing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Verizon Communications .",

On the camera front, you get 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom) rear lenses and a 12MP front camera\n\nAccessories\n\nCases sale: 25% off accessories @ Verizon\n\nVerizon is taking 25% off select accessories from Kate Spade, Coach, Beats, and more. The sale includes accessories for both iPhone and Android smartphones.\n\nIs Verizon a good carrier for phone deals?\n\nYes \u2014 in fact, Verizon ranks as No. 2 right now in our best phone carriers guide. This position comes down to a couple of key factors but mostly, it's due to its speed and coverage.\n\nWhen we've done tests on the LTE speeds, Verizon has been the highest performer. Its 5G reaches more than 70 cities and we've seen it easily offer 1Gbps download speeds.\n\nCombine Verizon's expanding 5G service with its extensive LTE network, and that's pretty comprehensive coverage. Verizon's overall 5G speeds don't quite match those of its rivals \u2014 the carrier's nationwide network isn't nearly as fast as Ultra Wideband \u2014 but performance is strong on the carrier.\n\nHowever, Verizon is by no means an affordable carrier and is frequently one of the most expensive options. You will likely find cheaper prices from T-Mobile or maybe even AT&T but its high performance makes up for this cost.\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nWhat kind of promotions does Verizon offer?\n\nTrade-in: Verizon has a number of great offers when it comes to phone deals but the main one is its trade-in promo. Verizon can offer you up to $1,000 off when you trade in on a large number of its phones.\n\nHowever, this is a maximum amount, reserved for high value (that is, newer and more expensive) devices. But even if you're trading in a budget handset, you should see a pretty significant reduction in price on your new device.\n\nVerizon recently extended its trade-in scheme to also cover old or or damaged phones (as long as they are free of battery damage). This obviously won't get you as much but its nice to know if you have a damaged phone.\n\n\n\nUpgrades: If you're an existing Verizon customer, you will have the option to upgrade. This is going to give you a number of pretty big discounts across a load of handsets when you log in. This is limited to unlimited plans and Verizon doesn't always offer this kind of discount so it is worth checking when you upgrade.\n\nFree plans: On a number of cheaper devices like the iPhone SE or Moto G Stylus, you can often get the phone for free. You do have to take out an unlimited plan, and the \"free\" part of the deal comes in the form of monthly bill credits, but this is a great promotion for those who know they'll be investing in a budget handset.",

Verizon is just about everywhere when it comes to advertising and coverage. Although it\u2019s often more expensive than its rivals, Verizon remains the most popular carrier in the US. Let\u2019s look at the best Verizon plans and how they compare against the competition.\n\nQUICK PICKS We'd recommend the Unlimited Welcome plan as the best option for all-purpose use unless you insist on the fastest connectivity at all times.

In mid-May of last year, Verizon introduced its new MyPlan strategy, replacing its existing postpaid options with two simplified Unlimited choices: Unlimited Welcome and Unlimited Plus. Since then, a third option has been added, but that\u2019s still much less confusing than AT&T and T-Mobile\u2019s plans.\n\nAs for Verizon\u2019s old plans? There\u2019s no way to sign up for them anymore, but you can keep the plan grandfathered in, just be aware Verizon has announced it raising prices for its older plans.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down: Unlimited Welcome is all about the basics. The Unlimited Welcome gives you access to Verizon\u2019s LTE and 5G network, though only its low-band nationwide network and not its faster ultrawide option. You get unlimited data but no premium data, meaning your line may experience deprioritization during times of congestion. In fact, you\u2019ll get the same priority level as most prepaid services. No perks are included here either, but you can add various perks for $10 a month, including Apple One, 100GB mobile hotspot access, a Disney Plus Bundle, a three-day travel pass, and more.\n\nThe Unlimited Welcome gives you access to Verizon\u2019s LTE and 5G network, though only its low-band nationwide network and not its faster ultrawide option.

No perks are included here either, but you can add various perks for $10 a month, including Apple One, 100GB mobile hotspot access, a Disney Plus Bundle, a three-day travel pass, and more. Unlimited Plus is the best for most. Unlimited Plus offers the same as the base plan but gives you 30GB of premium data and access to the 5G Ultra Wide network. This means you\u2019ll get better network priority. You also get 30GB of premium hotspot data. Again, you don\u2019t get any extra perks in the base pricing, but you can add additional perks for just $10 each. It\u2019s also worth noting you\u2019ll get better network prioritization over the Welcome tier.\n\nUnlimited Plus offers the same as the base plan but gives you 30GB of premium data and access to the 5G Ultra Wide network.

It\u2019s also worth noting you\u2019ll get better network prioritization over the Welcome tier. Unlimited Ultimate is better for travelers and those who want the latest phones. The Ultimate plan gives you 60GB of hotspot data, perfect if you travel a lot domestically. There\u2019s also 10GB of international high-speed data. Verizon says it doesn\u2019t throttle speeds internationally, either. As you can see, Verizon keeps its plans simpler than ever. Ironically, T-Mobile just made its plans a bit more complicated, so it\u2019s nice to see Verizon going in the other direction. Not interested in either of these choices? Verizon prepaid plans require no credit check or obligation, and there are quite a few more options depending on your usage needs.\n\nHere\u2019s what Verizon Prepaid has to offer at a glance: Talk & Text is perfect for senior citizens and those with basic needs. You\u2019ll pay just $30 with autopay, but you don\u2019t get data at all. If you really need Verizon\u2019s network and don\u2019t plan to get a smartphone or are happy sticking to Wi-Fi, this plan works, but other prepaid options from alternative networks will be much cheaper.\n\nYou\u2019ll pay just $30 with autopay, but you don\u2019t get data at all. If you really need Verizon\u2019s network and don\u2019t plan to get a smartphone or are happy sticking to Wi-Fi, this plan works, but other prepaid options from alternative networks will be much cheaper. 15GB plan is the best for those who don\u2019t need an unlimited plan. You\u2019ll only be able to use 15GB of data, and you might still suffer from prioritization during peaks, but this is a good plan for those who have limited data needs. You\u2019ll pay $35 a month, but after nine months, that price goes down to just $25 a month via loyalty discounts.\n\nYou\u2019ll only be able to use 15GB of data, and you might still suffer from prioritization during peaks, but this is a good plan for those who have limited data needs. You\u2019ll pay $35 a month, but after nine months, that price goes down to just $25 a month via loyalty discounts. Unlimited plan is best for single users who don\u2019t care about perks. At just $50 a line, this is a relatively cheap way to get unlimited data, and it gets even more affordable at nine months, thanks to a $10 monthly discount. You will get unlimited data but will be deprioritized during peaks.\n\nAt just $50 a line, this is a relatively cheap way to get unlimited data, and it gets even more affordable at nine months, thanks to a $10 monthly discount. You will get unlimited data but will be deprioritized during peaks. Unlimited Plus plan is best for single users who don\u2019t care about perks but want unlimited talk, text, data and yet also are looking to avoid deprioritization when possible. You\u2019ll pay $60 a line, but after nine months, that goes down to just $50 a month. You\u2019ll get 50GB of priority data and 5GB of hotspot data.\n\nVerizon Prepaid vs Postpaid: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nAt a glance, it can be pretty hard to tell the difference between Verizon postpaid and prepaid options. So what\u2019s the major difference? Let\u2019s take a closer look at the pros and cons of prepaid service:\n\nPros: Typically cheaper pricing and less commitment\n\nEasier to switch plans or carriers Cons: You\u2019ll get quality network service but much weaker customer service\n\nYou\u2019ll be more likely to face deprioritization than those who are on a post-paid plan\n\nYou won\u2019t typically get the extra perks you\u2019d get with post-paid, like streaming services, phone financing, etc\n\nRoaming agreements don\u2019t typically apply to prepaid, so there may be a few more areas where service isn\u2019t available\n\nTL;DR: the biggest differences are customer service, extras, and roaming. If you don\u2019t care bout these things, prepaid can be a great way to save money. And best of all, you don\u2019t need a credit check to qualify.\n\nShould I consider adding a Verizon Second Line plan? Want a secondary line but only need one device? Verizon gives you this option for just $10 a month, perfect for side gigs and other situations where you want more privacy and don\u2019t want to give away your main number.\n\nVerizon MyPlan perks: what are they, and how do they work? As we mentioned above, the new MyPlan offerings do things a bit differently. Instead of giving you free perks, they give you the option to add any perk you want for just $10 a month. You can control your perks through the Verizon app and can easily add and remove options as you need them. Only need a hotspot access for a month? You can add that easily. Same with Travel Pass and others.\n\nThe total list of optional perks at launch is as follows: Disney Bundle (Hulu, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus)\n\n2TB Cloud Storage\n\n100GB Mobile hotspot\n\nWalmart Plus Membership\n\nApple One\n\nApple Music Family\n\nSmartwatch Data\n\nThree TravelPass Days Verizon says more perks will be introduced in the future, and we\u2019ll update the list as new options are added.\n\nVerizon made a big change to its plan structure earlier this year, removing several plans and streamlining everything into just two plans: myPlan Unlimited Welcome and myPlan Unlimited Plus. Have one of the old Play/Do/Get More plans? You might want to hold off on upgrading, depending on your situation. You might save money if you don\u2019t need perks at all. For big families (especially those that use perks), you might end up paying more.\n\nWhich of Verizon\u2019s plans do we recommend?\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nWe\u2019ve already highlighted who each plan is for in the section above, but which ones do we actually recommend? For those interested in postpaid, we\u2019d say Unlimited Welcome is the best choice if you don\u2019t mind some deprioritization during peaks and don\u2019t plan to use hotspots regularly. You can always add hotspot access as a perk when you do need it.\n\nUnlimited Plus matters if you want 5G Wideband and high priority speeds, it\u2019s also the entry-level plan for hotspot access. For what it is worth, my daughter has a Verizon plan that does deprioritize during congestion and while it is noticeably slower than our lines, it usually still is completely usable outside of highly congested areas like major downtown areas. Need more data? We\u2019d suggest the Unlimited Ultimate plan instead.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to save money and really want to stick to Verizon directly, we\u2019d say most budget shoppers should get the Unlimited Prepaid plan. It\u2019s at least $15 cheaper than Verizon\u2019s least expensive postpaid plan and even includes hotspot access. Of course, you\u2019ll get lower priority than any of Verizon\u2019s postpaid plans outside of Welcome Unlimited. You\u2019ll also get less extensive roaming and lower-quality customer service, though not by a wide margin.\n\nIf you really want ultrawide 5G, you\u2019ll need to pay $10 more and get Plus Unlimited. If you don\u2019t care about improved 5G, it\u2019s probably not worth the extra cost. Just remember prepaid plans don\u2019t have discounts for multiple lines, making them a better option for a single user.\n\nDon\u2019t use a lot of data? The 15GB Prepaid plan is actually decently priced and is also worth consideration.\n\nWe take a closer look at our favorite plans below and dive into what makes them stand out:\n\nWelcome Unlimited: The best Verizon plan for basic users Verizon Welcome Unlimited is the most affordable way to get Verizon\u2019s service. It starts at $65 a line but scales down to as cheap as $27 a line for five lines. As the least expensive Verizon plan, it does cut a few features, but it still covers the basic Verizon experience.\n\nYou still get unlimited access to 4G LTE with 5G Nationwide access on compatible devices. It also packs unlimited talk and text, including in international locations like Mexico and Canada. Welcome Unlimited offers 480p streaming, which is in line with Verizon\u2019s 5G Start plan, but it drops a lot of extras like hotspot access and there is no priority data included.\n\nVerizon recently axed free perks, instead giving you the power to add perks for a discounted rate. Each perk costs $10 a month and can easily be switched. Some of the perks included a Disney Plus bundle, a Walmart Plus membership, Apple Music Family, and more. All of these rates are cheaper than they\u2019d cost outside of Verizon.\n\nBe aware that this plan is prioritized below Verizon\u2019s other postpaid plans, and in fact shares the same priority as many prepaid carriers. There are even a few prepaid providers that offer better priority for a similar price, such as Visible.\n\nPros: It\u2019s pretty affordable, especially for big families\n\nYou get access to Verizon\u2019s extensive 5g/LTE network\n\nInternational calling to locations such as Mexico and Canada\n\nYou can customize the perks you want and need Cons: It limits video streaming to standard definition (480p)\n\nThere\u2019s no hotspot data or priority access\n\nPlus Unlimited: For those who want the fastest experience possible Verizon Plus Unlimited takes everything from the Welcome plan but adds extras like 5G ultra wideband access and 30GB highspeed premium hotspot data with 600Kbps speeds after you use up your cap. You\u2019ll also be prioritized over the Welcome tier during times of congestion.\n\nThose are really the only major differences. It still packs unlimited talk and text, including in international locations like Mexico and Canada. You still get 480p streaming, so there are no full HD options, unfortunately.\n\nVerizon recently axed free perks, instead giving you the power to add perks for a discounted rate.

All of these rates are cheaper than they\u2019d cost outside of Verizon.\n\nPros: You get plenty of hotspot access\n\nYou get access to Verizon\u2019s extensive 5g/LTE network, including ultra-wideband 5G\n\nInternational calling to locations such as Mexico and Canada\n\nYou can customize the perks you want and need Cons: There\u2019s little extra for the $15 more you\u2019ll pay over Welcome unless you really need hotspot access\n\nIt limits video streaming to standard definition (480p)\n\nUltimate Unlimited: For those who travel regularly Verizon Ultimate Unlimited takes everything from the Plus plan but adds double the hotspot data at 60GB. There\u2019s also 10GB of high-speed international data included. That\u2019s honestly about it. Everything else remains the same.\n\nPros: 60GB of hotspot data is perfect for regular travelers\n\nYou also get 10GB of high-speed international data Cons: It\u2019s very expensive if you don\u2019t use these traveling perks.\n\n15GB pre-paid: Great for those who don\u2019t need a lot of data At just $35 a month with autopay, you get 15GB of data to use how you wish. Your hotspot feeds from your total data cap, but it should still be plenty. You\u2019ll also get unlimited talk and text, plus calls to Canada and Mexico are included at no extra cost.\n\nOne of the best things is the loyalty perk, which can bring your cost down to just $25 a month after nine months. This is actually pretty competitive, considering it\u2019s service directly from a major carrier.\n\nPros: Great value if you don\u2019t need a lot of data\n\nUse up to 15GB for hotspot\n\nLoyalty discounts Cons: Not tons of data, but you get what you pay for\n\nUnlimited prepaid: A good value for prepaid service The last Verizon plan on the menu gives you a taste of unlimited data at a prepaid rate. At just $50 with autopay and as little as $40 a month after 9 months of service, this is actually a really decent value. The unlimited prepaid plan might also be your best option for North American travel, as talk, text, and data in Canada and Mexico are included at no extra charge.\n\nUnlike the Welcome tier for postpaid customers, you do get 6GB of hotspot access. After you blow through your cap, you can still use it but you\u2019ll be limited to 600Kbps \u2014 basically just enough to check emails and such.\n\nPros: Great value if you don\u2019t need a lot of data\n\nUse up to 15GB for hotspot\n\nLoyalty discounts Cons: Not tons of data, but you get what you pay for\n\nNeed more hotspot access, or want wideband 5G? Sign up for Unlimited Plus instead, which starts at $60 with autopsy.\n\nIs Verizon's Unlimited Cloud data good? Yes, Verizon\u2019s Unlimited Cloud service is absolutely one of the best cloud storage platforms around. The only catch is you have to be a Verizon customer. Verizon offers a few different plans, but the Unlimited ones are the most intriguing. You\u2019ll pay just $14 a month individually or $20 for up to five total users. This is a great deal as Verizon gives you truly unlimited space, though it has a few restrictions on file sizes and how much you can upload in one month. Really if you use a lot of cloud storage space, this is without a doubt one of the most affordable plans available.\n\nVerizon vs the competition\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to switch carriers, it might help to check out a head-to-head-to-head showdown. We\u2019ve stacked Verizon against the top options from both AT&T and T-Mobile to help you choose.

Prices are also pretty comparable now.\n\nObviously, there are many more plans from each carrier. If you\u2019re looking to dive deeper, we recommend looking at our guides to the best T-Mobile plans and best AT&T plans.\n\nWant Verizon service on a budget?\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Verizon\u2019s service is some of the most expensive around. As one of the largest and fastest networks in the US, you could argue that\u2019s justified. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to send your money right to Big Red to use its service, as several MVNOs rely on Verizon.\n\nCheck out the table below for more information:\n\nUS Mobile Red Pocket PagePlus Total Wireless Visible Cost\n\nUS Mobile Build your own with talk, text, and data for as little as $5 per month\n\nUnlimited from $40 per month\n\nRed Pocket Limited plans as low as $10 per month\n\nUnlimited plans for $60 per month\n\nPagePlus Limited plans as low as $12 per month\n\nUnlimited plans for $55 per month\n\nTotal Wireless 1 line starts at $23.70 for 1GB 4G LTE data\n\n1 line up to $47.50 for 25GB 4G LTE data\n\nVisible $40 per month\n\nAs low as $25 with Party Pay\n\nTalk & Text\n\nUS Mobile Starts at 75 minutes for $2\n\nStarts at 50 texts for $1.50\n\nRed Pocket $10 plan includes 500 texts and 500 minutes\n\nPlans above $15 include unlimited talk and text\n\nPagePlus 500 minutes talk and 500 texts for $12\n\nUnlimited for all other plans\n\nTotal Wireless Unlimited\n\nVisible Unlimited\n\nData\n\nUS Mobile Starts at 50MB for $1.50\n\nRed Pocket Starts at 500MB for $10\n\nUnlimited data for $60\n\nPagePlus 100MB for $12\n\n3GB 4G LTE for $30\n\n8GB 4G LTE for $40\n\nUnlimited for $55\n\nTotal Wireless up to 25GB high-speed data\n\nVisible Unlimited\n\nHotspot\n\nUS Mobile Add 10GB to the Unlimited All plan for $5\n\nRed Pocket Hotspot available\n\nPagePlus Not available\n\nTotal Wireless Up to 10GB on plans above $50\n\nVisible Unlimited\n\nInternational\n\nUS Mobile Up to 10GB for Unlimited plans\n\nRed Pocket Free calls to 80 countries\n\nPagePlus Plans above $12 include $10 international calling card\n\nTotal Wireless $10 global calling card available\n\nVisible Not available\n\nExtras\n\nUS Mobile Pick your subscription perks with 2, 3, and 4 line plans\n\n5G access available\n\nRed Pocket Free SIM card\n\nPagePlus Video streams at DVD quality\n\nTotal Wireless Earn rewards points that can be used to pay for service\n\nVisible Save with Party Pay\n\n\n\nUS Mobile US Mobile is a unique Verizon MVNO in that you can build your plan just how you like it. In fact, everyone in your entire family can customize a plan. You pick your talk, text, and data, and US Mobile gives you a price. There\u2019s even a brand-new unlimited plan that costs just $40 per month. The unlimited plan offers your choice of subscription services for free with two, three, and four-line plans.\n\nRed Pocket You may not be as familiar with Red Pocket, but it\u2019s an effective way to save money, thanks to its variety of plans. There are plenty of limited service options to choose from, all the way up to unlimited access. Red Pocket actually runs on all of the Big Three networks, but you\u2019ll lock into a carrier when you sign up.\n\nPagePlus PagePlus is similar to Red Pocket, with limited and unlimited service tiers. The pricing structure is about the same, but PagePlus warns on its website about using more than 60GB of data per month. You can also opt for pay-as-you-go minutes, data add-on cards, and international add-on cards.\n\nTotal Wireless Total Wireless has several single-line and family plans, and each includes unlimited talk and text. The data is unlimited as well, though you have to pay more for unlimited high-speed access. Total\u2019s basic unlimited plans offer just 1GB of high-speed data before you fall back down to 2G speeds.\n\nVisible Visible serves as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon, but it offers one plan at one price. You can save with Party Pay, and unlimited talk, text, and data are included. There\u2019s no international access, but we\u2019ve had good personal experiences with Visible.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWho owns Verizon? At one point, Bell and Vodafone were among Verizon\u2019s owners. These days, Verizon is owned by Verizon Communications and is a fully US-based company.\n\nHow do you get Disney Plus with Verizon? Disney Plus can be added to any postpaid plan for just $10.\n\nHow do you unlock a Verizon phone? The great thing about Verizon is you might not have to unlock your phone! Unless it\u2019s a prepaid device or an ancient iPhone 3G World device, Verizon phones are already unlocked for use on other supported carriers. However, we have a complete guide to walk prepaid and 3G World phone users through the unlock process.\n\nDoes Verizon have 5G, and does it cost extra? Yes, Verizon has one of the strongest 5G networks in the US, with at least partial mmWave support in over 35 cities. 5G is included with most of Verizon\u2019s plans at no extra cost, though only select plans have wideband access.\n\nDoes Verizon have plans that are not unlimited? Verizon postpaid service only offers unlimited plans but it is possible to get limited Verizon service from Verizon Prepaid or a Verizon-based MVNO.\n\nWhat is the best Verizon plan for two lines? Verizon Prepaid isn\u2019t a great choice for multiple lines in terms of savings. Beyond that, any Verizon Unlimited plan is going to work great for families so the \u2018best\u2019 really will depend on your needs more than anything.\n\nYou might like",

            "content": "On Friday, a federal judge in Pennsylvania dismissed a proposed class action lawsuit against Verizon Communications Inc., ruling that the plaintiff, former utility pole worker Mark Tiger, lacked standing to sue in federal court. The lawsuit alleged that Verizon\u2019s failure to properly dispose of lead-sheathed telecommunications cables endangered utility pole workers who were regularly exposed to them. View the court\u2019s opinion.\n\nYesterday, Verizon filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority in Bostard v. Verizon, arguing that the dismissal in Tiger v. Verizon should apply to the New Jersey case as well. Verizon\u2019s attorneys highlighted the identical legal deficiencies in both cases, noting that the plaintiffs in Bostard also failed to allege elevated lead levels in their bodies and their claims of economic injury from medical testing do not meet enforceable standards, stating that the risk of future exposure is speculative and insufficient to establish standing.\n\nAs reported by Wireless Estimator in September 2023, Greg Bostard, a former Comcast worker, sued Verizon over lead exposure from telecommunications cables. His complaint, which was filed by the same legal team representing Tiger, mirrors the allegations in the Pennsylvania case.\n\nIn the February 7, 2025 decision, Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania found that Tiger had not sufficiently demonstrated a concrete and imminent injury, a requirement for Article III standing under the U.S. Constitution. The judge dismissed all claims without prejudice, allowing for the possibility that Tiger could refile his case in state court.\n\nBackground of the case\n\nTiger, who worked as a utility pole worker from 2019 to 2024, claimed that he regularly came into contact with Verizon\u2019s lead-sheathed cables while employed by Figure 8 Communications and Duda Cable Construction.\n\nHe alleged that he ingested and inhaled lead particles from these cables, leading to symptoms such as headaches, nausea, fatigue, irritability, and muscle and joint pain. However, since Tiger never sought medical attention, he lacked medical documentation to confirm lead-related illness.\n\nIn his 2023 lawsuit, Tiger sought to represent all utility pole workers in Pennsylvania who were exposed to Verizon\u2019s cables. The complaint asserted claims for negligence, negligence per se, and public nuisance and requested class certification, a court-supervised medical monitoring program, and removal of Verizon\u2019s lead-sheathed cables.\n\nVerizon filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Tiger lacked standing, failed to demonstrate actual harm, and that his claims were untimely. The company also noted that since Tiger had left his job as a utility pole worker, his request for injunctive relief was moot.\n\nCourt\u2019s rationale for dismissal\n\nJudge Ranjan\u2019s decision focused on whether Tiger had suffered an actual or imminent injury. The court concluded:\n\nExposure to lead alone does not constitute an injury: Tiger failed to provide medical evidence showing that he had elevated lead levels in his body or had developed a lead-related illness.\n\nCommon symptoms are not sufficient for standing: Tiger\u2019s symptoms, such as fatigue and headaches, could be linked to numerous other causes and were not necessarily indicative of lead poisoning.\n\nMedical monitoring does not establish standing: The judge ruled that a need for future medical testing does not qualify as a present economic injury under Article III.\n\nThe ruling said future lead exposure is speculative since Tiger had left his job and there was no imminent threat of continued exposure to lead.",

As fans gathered to watch the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, Verizon customers used 93.5 TB of data. No matter where they were celebrating, fans benefited from the massive network upgrades made across the city and were able to watch game highlights, keep tabs on players\u2019 stats, and livestream with friends to share their experience.\n\nThe fans in attendance at Caesars Superdome used 38.1 TB of data in and around the stadium, with approximately 53% of the 65,719 attendees using Verizon\u2019s network.\n\nVerizon customers benefited from super-fast speeds1 in the stadium, with 2.4x faster median download speeds and 4.8x faster median upload speeds than the competition!\n\nPeak: Download speed 4,161 Mbps, Upload speed 1,067 Mbps\n\nDownload speed 4,161 Mbps, Upload speed 1,067 Mbps Median: Download speed 1,775 Mbps, Upload speed 159 Mbps\n\nCommitted to New Orleans for the future\n\nFor the past three years, Verizon has been focused on providing the most reliable network experience in New Orleans for our customers, and has been making significant investments that nearly triple New Orleans\u2019 network capacity and ready it for the more than 18 million tourists and business travelers who come to the city each year. Verizon laid out more than 560 miles of fiber in the Greater New Orleans area, which is enough fiber to wrap around the outside of the Caesars Superdome 869 times.\n\nVerizon added unmatched large capacity connections across the city and at the most congested areas in New Orleans, including Bourbon Street, the New Orleans Convention Center, Louis Armstrong International Airport, Smoothie King Arena, Woldenberg Park, and Jackson Square.

However, the judge said the plaintiff may have standing to bring his claims in state court instead of federal court.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in September 2023, about two months after a Wall Street Journal report said that at least 2,000 lead-covered telephone cables installed decades ago by multiple phone companies had not been removed.\n\nPlaintiff Mark Tiger, who previously worked for Figure 8 Communications and Duda Cable Construction, the latter of which is a Comcast contractor, \"regularly worked around and came into direct contact with Verizon's lead-sheathed cables,\" US District Judge Nicholas Ranjan wrote in an opinion issued Friday. \"His clothes and body regularly rubbed against the cables as he climbed up the utility poles, and he had to grab onto the cables while he worked. And then when he touched his face with his hands or used his hands to eat, he ingested and inhaled the lead. He was routinely sick while he worked with the cables and experienced mood changes, headaches, nausea, fatigue, irritability, muscle and joint pain, and constipation, which are symptoms associated with lead exposure. Because he did not have insurance, he did not see a doctor.\"\n\nJudge: Mere exposure to lead not enough\n\nA November 2024 filing said that Tiger recently \"left his job because of his concerns regarding the effect of continued exposure to Verizon's lead cables on his health.\" Tiger alleges that Verizon was negligent and sought class certification for all utility pole workers who were occupationally exposed to Verizon's lead-sheathed cables in Pennsylvania. He said Verizon should dispose of the cables and pay for medical monitoring because lead can be stored in the body for years or decades and symptoms may not occur immediately.",

            "content": "As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\n\nT-Mobile and SpaceX\u2019s Starlink are working together to eliminate mobile dead zones by bringing satellite connectivity directly to smartphones \u2013 without requiring any extra hardware.\n\nThe service is powered by specially-configured satellites orbiting over 200 miles above Earth at speeds exceeding 17,000 miles per hour, delivering cellular signals to areas where traditional tower coverage fails.\n\nAt launch, the T-Mobile Starlink network will support text messaging, group texts, and reactions. The two companies plan to expand the service to include picture messaging, voice calls, and mobile data. When a phone moves out of range of a cell tower, it will automatically connect to Starlink\u2019s satellites, so communication continues without any manual user intervention; messages will continue to be sent and received as they would on a cell network.\n\nAccording to T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert, the collaboration between the two companies is a breakthrough in wireless connectivity. \u201cT-Mobile Starlink is the first and only space-based mobile network in the US that automatically connects to your phone, so you can stay connected even where no cellular network reaches,\u201d Sievert said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early days, but we\u2019re officially putting \u2018no bars\u2019 on notice.\u2019 Dead zones, your days are numbered.\u201d\n\nConnectivity \u2013 anywhere with a clear view of the sky\n\nThe T-Mobile Starlink service is designed to work on most smartphones released in the last four years, so there is no need for special equipment or hardware upgrade. T-Mobile will release a list of supported devices which will include models with the minimum spec of the iPhone 14, Samsung Galaxy S21, and some Google Pixel devices. More model will be added over time.\n\nBeyond standard messaging, the network will also support Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs), so users in remote locations or disaster-stricken areas can receive important notifications from a T-Mobile Starlink satellite outside traditional cellular coverage zones.\n\nBeta testing begins \u2013 free access until July\n\nT-Mobile is beginning to enrol users in a beta programme ahead of the official launch in July. Initially, the corporation invited a few T-Mobile with newer devices to test the service. However, the beta is now open to everyone with any wireless carrier, including AT&T and Verizon customers. Beta programme participants will be enrolled gradually as T-Mobile fine-tunes the service before full rollout.\n\nOnce the service officially launches, pricing will be as follows:\n\nT-Mobile Go5G Next and Go5G Business Next customers: Included at no additional cost\n\nT-Mobile customers on other plans: $15 per month per line\n\nAT&T and Verizon customers: $20 per month per line\n\nFor early adopters, T-Mobile is offering a discount throughout February, charging $10 per month per line \u2013 a 33% reduction.\n\nAT&T and Verizon customers can join the beta\n\nAT&T and Verizon customers also get the chance to join the beta programme on their existing smartphones, and will be able to send satellite texts for free. After the full launch in July, they will have the option to continue their subscription at $20 per month per line rate. The service does not require any additional hardware \u2013 only a compatible, unlocked smartphone that supports eSIMs.\n\nBuilding a global satellite network\n\nT-Mobile and Starlink\u2019s offering is initially for US customers, but global wireless providers are invited to join the satellite-to-mobile alliance. Several international carriers have already partnered, including KDDI (Japan), Telstra (Australia), Optus (Australia), One NZ (New Zealand), Rogers (Canada), Salt (Switzerland), Entel (Chile & Peru), and Kyivstar (Ukraine).\n\nExpanding the future of space-based connectivity\n\nAt present, T-Mobile Starlink connectivity is limited to SMS messaging, but future upgrades will introduce voice calling and mobile data, effectively turning every subscriber\u2019s compatible smartphone into a satellite-enabled device.\n\nThe beta programme is now open.\n\n(Photo by Unsplash)\n\nSee also: AST SpaceMobile stock soars following Verizon partnership announcement\n\nLooking to revamp your digital transformation strategy?

            "content": "T-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile is expanding its Starlink satellite service to mobile phone users on rival carriers. On Sunday, the Uncarrier announced that the current beta testing is now available to AT&T and Verizon customers, who will also be able to subscribe to the service once it officially launches. T-Mobile also used a Super Bowl ad to tout its Starlink coverage to a vast audience.\n\nThe beta will run until July\n\nKicking off free beta testing to iOS and Android users in January, T-Mobile's Starlink uses a network of low-Earth orbit satellites to grant people high-speed internet access in dead zones where traditional cellular or Wi-Fi access is unavailable. The current lineup of Starlink's 300 direct-to-cell satellites provides coverage for the 500,000 square miles of land in the US not covered by cell towers.\n\nAlso: I turned my Starlink Mini into a near-perfect off-grid internet solution. Here's how\n\nT-Mobile's Starlink also broadcasts Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) across the US to anyone with a compatible phone in range of the signal. With WEAs, you can receive critical messages that alert you to dangerous weather conditions or natural disasters.\n\nThe beta phase will run until July, giving you a good six months to test the coverage and provide feedback. After the beta ends, you can decide if you want to continue the service.\n\nThe cost\n\nFor T-Mobile customers, the cost will vary based on your current plan. Starlink will be included for free on the top-tier Go5G Next plan, as well as variations like Go5G Next 55+ for people 55 and older and the Go5G Business Next plan for business users. The service will also be included at no extra cost for Go5G First Responder subscriptions and other premium-rate plans.\n\nT-Mobile users on other plans will pay $15 a month for Starlink. But if you sign up for the beta testing before the end of February, you'll get an Early Adopter discount, paying just $10 a month. Finally, AT&T and Verizon customers will pay $20 a month for the service.\n\nWhat can you do with Starlink?\n\nT-Mobile answered that question with a small footnote in its Super Bowl ad. The public beta testing allows only plain text messaging. Voice calls, video and photo sharing, and mobile data will follow at some point.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Mike Katz, T-Mobile's president of marketing, strategy, and products, said the carrier expects its Starlink service to handle multimedia texts with photos and videos by the end of the beta phase. Apps that don't require fast data connections, such as WhatsApp and certain mapping and trail programs, may also be supported.\n\nAlso: United's free in-flight Starlink Wi-Fi is now launching even earlier than we expected\n\nLooking to the future, Katz cited T-Mobile's vision as one in which Starlink would allow for heavier data use. That could mean FaceTime video calls and even movie streaming. But those capabilities would require additional satellites in orbit.\n\nUsing the Starlink service is a seamless process. If you lose cellular coverage, your phone will automatically connect to a Starlink satellite to provide internet access. This ease of use contrasts with Apple's satellite-based iPhone emergency service, which requires you to manually activate it.\n\nWhat you need to use the service\n\nTo take advantage of the service, you'll need any iPhone or Android phone from the last four years. T-Mobile specifically lists the following phones on its Starlink web page:\n\nApple iPhone 14 and later (including Plus, Pro, and Pro Max)\n\nGoogle Pixel 9 (including Pro, Pro Fold, and Pro XL)\n\nMotorola 2024 and later (including Razr, Razr+, Edge, and G series)\n\nSamsung Galaxy A14, A15, A16, A35, A53, and A54\n\nSamsung Galaxy S21 and later (including Plus, Ultra, and Fan Edition)\n\nSamsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 and later\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and later\n\nREVVL 7 (including Pro)\n\niPhone users will also have to update their device to at least iOS 18.3, which Apple released in late January. Android users will want to make sure they're running version 15.\n\nHow to join beta\n\nTo sign up for the beta, fill out the form on T-Mobile's Starlink page. You'll then have to wait to see if and when you get access.\n\nAlso: Comcast's new low-latency internet is literally game-changing, and these cities will get it first\n\nThe carrier says that beta testers are being admitted on a rolling, first-come, first-served basis, so you'll want to sign up ASAP if you hope to join in.",

Walking up to the protest, I could see scattered groups of demonstrators lined up along about two blocks, spanning from the Tesla store to a nearby intersection and Sprouts location. One protestor said he had counted about 230 people at around 1:00 p.m. MT.\n\nThe protest felt generally peaceful, with cars driving by and honking, and demonstrators leaving a large space between the front of the Tesla store and the sidewalk, easily allowing workers and customers to go in and out.\n\nYou can see a few videos and photos from the site below, along with some of the responses I got from protestors and a prospective customer.\n\nWalking up to the protest, I could see scattered groups of demonstrators lined up along about two blocks, spanning from the Tesla store to a nearby intersection and Sprouts location.\n\nOne protestor said he had counted about 230 people at around 1:00 p.m. MT. pic.twitter.com/gbZIuWWej7 \u2014 TESLARATI (@Teslarati) March 15, 2025\n\nProtests in front of the Tesla store in Loveland, Colorado pic.twitter.com/qLRM9TY0ng\n\n\u2014 TESLARATI (@Teslarati) March 15, 2025\n\nREAD MORE ON TESLA PROTESTS AND VANDALISM:\n\nI spoke to about a dozen protestors about what they were protesting against. Most said they were there to condemn Musk\u2019s recent federal worker and program cuts with the Trump administration, his performance of what some said resembled a Nazi salute at Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony in January, or the administration\u2019s recent attacks against transgender and queer individuals.\n\nOne protestor, Elsa, identified as a former Republican and said she was \u201chighly concerned that our Constitution is being ignored,\u201d especially with regards to the three branches of government and the system of checks and balances.\n\n\u201cIt surprises me that, even if you voted for Trump, or you believe in capitalism, which, I didn\u2019t vote for Trump, but I do believe in capitalism \u2014 I\u2019m a former Republican, I was a Republican for most of my life \u2014 but it\u2019s dangerous to have power rest in a handful of ultra-wealthy people,\u201d Elsa said.\n\n\u201cAnd our whole country needs to realize that,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis to me is not even Republican or Democrat at this point.\u201d\n\nInstead, she says it now comes down to whether people want to give billionaires huge tax breaks, or to use that money to support a range of groups in the U.S., including those who have social security benefits, are veterans, or are 9/11 survivors seeking cancer treatments, as a few examples.\n\nAnother protestor, Mary, said she was taking part in the demonstration \u201cbecause she loves this country and democracy,\u201d adding that she wanted to help preserve democracy for her grandchildren.\n\nStill another protestor, Bryan, said that they were protesting because of the Trump administration and Musk\u2019s attempts to erase transgender, non-binary, and queer people from history, drawing comparisons to the rise of fascism in Nazi Germany, where early human rights violations were lodged against gay and queer communities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I have to be,\u201d Brian said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of the future.\u201d\n\nYet another person and his family were holding Ukraine flags, saying that they were protesting for a wide range of reasons, but especially for Trump\u2019s recent meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Musk\u2019s claims that the top Ukrainian executive was to blame for what he has called a \u201cforever war.\u201d\n\nWhile most protestors appeared to be generally friendly, especially with each other, I did hear a few exchanges between demonstrators and those with other opinions. While I heard more cars honking throughout the experience, seemingly in support of the protests, I also noticed a few from which passengers yelled things like \u201cGo Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cDirect action, we need to stop these fascists with direct action,\u201d one protestor yelled in response.\n\nAdditionally, I also talked to a prospective customer, Kristy, who was there for a test drive and said she had a negative experience with the protestors.\n\n\u201cI was test driving a Tesla, and as we pulled in and parked right here, this black one, these people right here in the middle yelled at me, \u2018Hope you\u2019re turning in your f*cking Nazi car,\u2019 and I said \u2018F*ck you,\u2019\u201d Kristy explained.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re like \u2018F*ck you too, you\u2019re a Nazi, f*cking Nazi lovers.\u2019 And so, they\u2019re just yelling racial slurs at me, and I\u2019m far from a Nazi.\u201d\n\nTesla store advisers declined to comment on the protests, and so did Loveland police.\n\nOther Saturday protest footage from Tesla stores in Santa Rosa, California, and Austin, Texas\n\nThe Loveland Tesla store has also been the site of repeated attacks in recent weeks, with authorities on Friday making a second arrest following multiple incidents. You can see the Department\u2019s press release for the arrest below.\n\nAnother arrest has been made by the Loveland Police Department.\ud83d\ude94 The arrest was related to an incident earlier this month, which involved an incendiary device being ignited and thrown at a Tesla location. https://t.co/s1pZjAacD3\u2014 TESLARATI (@Teslarati) March 14, 2025\n\nThe protest was also part of widespread demonstrations on Saturday, and it\u2019s just the latest in actions targeting Musk\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) company, some of which have included acts of vandalism, graffiti, arson, and even the use of weapons on Tesla storefronts.\n\nMultiple other protests were also captured in footage on Saturday, including one in Santa Rosa, California, as shared by the San Francisco Chronicle, and another attended by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in Austin, Texas.

            "content": "Late last year, T-Mobile said it was getting ready to start beta testing SpaceX's Starlink service. It appears the program is ready for takeoff, with the carrier expected to announce during the Super Bowl that it's begun letting users access satellite service.\n\nAs part of the beta, people in the program will be able to send SMS text messages when they're outdoors, even in areas where they don't normally get T-Mobile's terrestrial coverage. The beta service will be free and open to all T-Mobile postpaid users until July, with the carrier also making it available for free during this time to AT&T and Verizon customers.\n\nIn July, the carrier plans to begin charging for the service. It'll be included as part of T-Mobile's priciest Go5G Next plan and available as an add-on to its other plans for $15 per month, per line. T-Mobile users signing up for the service this month will be able to lock in a discounted rate of $10 per month, per line as part of an \"early adopter\" deal.\n\nAT&T and Verizon users will be able to continue using the service for $20 per month, per line. Those users won't need to switch to T-Mobile to add Starlink service but will need an unlocked compatible device that supports eSIMs.\n\nT-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon users interested in signing up for the beta can do so at T-Mobile's website, with the carrier planning to add users to the new service on a first come, first served rolling basis. As it goes through the list, it'll reach back out with instructions when users who sign up for the beta are able to join.\n\nThe carrier wasn't planning on offering satellite coverage to AT&T and Verizon users but says it was moved to do so after seeing Verizon's latest ad that features astronaut Buzz Aldrin touting satellite texting on its network. The ad has already racked up over 8 million views on YouTube.\n\nClint Patterson, senior vice president of marketing at T-Mobile, tells CNET that when it came to supporting rival carriers \"candidly, this was not part of our original plan for the Super Bowl.\"\n\n\"When we saw Verizon's latest ad, advertising something that you can't do on Verizon's network, we felt like we needed to act.\"\n\nT-Mobile says that it and Starlink have more than 450 satellites currently in orbit that \"provide coverage to 500,000 square miles of terrain inaccessible by terrestrial networks.\"\n\nPatterson said T-Mobile has already added \"tens of thousands\" of users into the beta.\n\nThe carrier notes it's been working with SpaceX and device manufacturers on optimizing smartphones to be able to connect to the new service, with the goal being that as long as you have a view of the sky, you should be able to stay connected.\n\nT-Mobile says it's been working with manufacturers to \"ensure the vast majority of T-Mobile phones released in the last four years will work with T-Mobile Starlink,\" including the iPhone 14 and Galaxy S21.\n\nCoverage in emergencies\n\nT-Mobile and SpaceX first announced their partnership back in 2022 and have more recently used the technology to keep people informed and connected during natural disasters. The two companies previously turned on the service in response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene last year and this month enabled it for people dealing with the Los Angeles fires.\n\nIn emergency situations, the company may make the service available to all, regardless of plan, according to Mike Katz, president of marketing, strategy and products at T-Mobile. \"In times of emergency, you kind of have to put down your competitive guards and realize that there's things more important ... and that people that are affected by these tragedies need help,\" he said. \"So that will always be our guiding principle on those things.\"\n\nAs part of its deployment in response to the Los Angeles fires, the carrier only opened up the Starlink support to users with most Android phones and older iPhone models prior to the iPhone 14 series. Those with an iPhone 14 or newer phone were instead pushed to use Apple's satellite service, which the iPhone maker offers with Globalstar.\n\nWith the beta and full launch, T-Mobile will support more-recent devices across both Android and iOS. The carrier isn't providing a list of compatible devices, but Katz notes that the phones available for the beta \"will be the fewest number of eligible devices, and literally, like probably weekly, it will expand.\"\n\n\"All newer devices at some point are going to be included in it,\" Katz said, adding that the carrier will be notifying customers when their phone is compatible for the beta.\n\nT-Mobile said that as part of the opening of this new beta service, it'll also be able to use the Starlink constellation to be able to broadcast Wireless Emergency Alerts from government and local officials nationwide to anyone, regardless of whether they have T-Mobile or a different provider.\n\nStarting with texting, data coming this year\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nThough T-Mobile and SpaceX's initial Starlink service will focus on texting, the plan is to add support for voice and data, something that could help the carrier's offering stand out from what's bundled in from device makers.\n\nPatterson said that though the carrier is starting with SMS texting in the beta, it plans to offer data services over satellite \"later this year\" and voice services, like calling, in the future.\n\nApple's satellite solution allows for sending messages to emergency services and, with iOS 18, regular iMessages over satellite. Google recently introduced an emergency satellite messaging option in partnership with provider Skylo for its Pixel 9 series of phones; it's just for emergency messages.\n\nApple and Google currently don't charge for their satellite messaging services, though both have hinted they may add a fee for the feature down the line.\n\nKatz said that as T-Mobile works through the beta and toward a commercial launch, phones will know how to handle conflicts between differing satellite services, with the first option being the carrier's service rather than one from a manufacturer. \"The phones are all designed to search for the carrier network first and then go to the other one,\" he said. \"And this is an extension of the carrier network.\"",

            "content": "BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Minutes ago, during the country\u2019s largest annual sporting event, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) introduced the next big thing in wireless \u2014 T-Mobile Starlink \u2014 to tens of millions of football fans. Now in public beta, this breakthrough service, developed in partnership with Starlink, uses straight-out-of-a-sci-fi-movie satellite and mobile communications technology to help keep people connected \u2014 even you, Verizon and AT&T customers \u2014 in the more than 500,000 square miles of the country unreached by any carrier\u2019s earth-bound cell towers. That\u2019s nearly the size of two Texases!\n\nT-Mobile Starlink uses specially configured satellites with Direct-to-Cell capabilities orbiting the Earth 200+ miles up in space and traveling at over 17,000 miles per hour to deliver cell phone signals \u2014 text messages for now with picture messages, data and voice calls coming later \u2014 to and from locations traditional cell towers can\u2019t reach (aka mobile dead zones).\n\n\u201cT-Mobile Starlink is the first and only space-based mobile network in the US that automatically connects to your phone so you can be connected even where no cellular network reaches. It\u2019s a massive technical achievement and an absolute game changer for ALL wireless users,\u201d said Mike Sievert, President and CEO, T-Mobile. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early days \u2014 I don\u2019t want to overhype the experience during a beta test \u2014 but we\u2019re officially putting \u2018no bars\u2019 on notice. Dead zones, your days are numbered at the Un-carrier.\u201d\n\nIf you can see the sky, you\u2019re connected\n\nThe beauty of the service is its simplicity: users don\u2019t need to do anything out of the ordinary. When a user\u2019s cell phone gets out of range of a cell tower, the phone automatically connects to the T-Mobile Starlink network. No need to manually connect. Messages are sent and received just as they are today on a traditional network, even group texts and reactions. And it works on most smartphones from the last four years. It\u2019s not limited to a few smartphones or operating systems.\n\nAnd to double down on keeping all people connected, T-Mobile Starlink also broadcasts Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) nationwide to anyone in range of the signal and with a compatible device.\n\nSatellite-based WEA service helps ensure everyone \u2014 even outside of terrestrial coverage, as long as they are in range of a T-Mobile Starlink satellite \u2014 can receive critical, potentially life-saving messages directly to their phone. Whether in remote areas like hiking trails or in areas impacted by severe weather or by natural disasters, more people now have access to the WEA broadcast when they need it most.\n\nThe beta is free until July at which point T-Mobile Starlink will be included at no extra cost on Go5G Next (including variations like Go5G Next 55+), T-Mobile\u2019s best plan. Business customers will also get T-Mobile Starlink at no extra cost on Go5G Business Next, first responder agencies on T-Priority plans and other select premium rate plans. T-Mobile customers on any other plan can add the service for $15/month per line.\n\nThrough February, T-Mobile customers who have registered for the beta can secure a $10/month per line Early Adopter Discount, 33% off the full price.\n\nAT&T and Verizon customers hate dead zones, too\n\nWhen your service is amazing and different, you want as many people to try it as possible. T-Mobile is giving AT&T and Verizon customers the opportunity to try out T-Mobile Starlink satellite service on their existing phones. With T-Mobile Starlink, every compatible smartphone can turn into a satellite phone \u2014 no fancy equipment needed. During the beta period, Verizon and AT&T customers can experience T-Mobile Starlink text messaging for free, and once the service launches in July, it will be available for $20/month per line.\n\nT-Mobile Starlink Beta Registration\n\nThe beta phase gives T-Mobile the means to test the service gradually before launching in July to the hundreds of millions of wireless users who can benefit from our vision of nearly ubiquitous coverage.\n\nEveryone on any carrier \u2014 including businesses and first responders \u2014 can sign up for the beta. Users will be enrolled on an ongoing basis to help test the system and provide feedback before launching in July.\n\nMore details and consumer registration can be found here.\n\nBusinesses and first responder agencies can register here.\n\nA Vision for Universal Coverage\n\nAs T-Mobile and Starlink continue to work towards eliminating mobile deadzones, the companies welcome wireless providers from around the world to join their growing alliance, which aims to provide reciprocal roaming for all participating carriers. So far, KDDI (Japan), Telstra (Australia), Optus (Australia), One NZ (New Zealand), Salt (Switzerland), Entel (Chile & Peru), Rogers (Canada) and Kyivstar (Ukraine) are among the providers that have signed on to join the cause and launch satellite-to-mobile technology.

That network is particularly important because the coaching staffs of both the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles rely on a Verizon 5G network for their communications and, of course, tens of thousands of fans in the stadium will rely on it for their connectivity. Russo discussed the week\u2019s efforts and the future of 5G as a tool for broadcast production with SVG.\n\nWhat does Super Bowl Week mean for Verizon, given your role working with the NFL and also supporting the wireless needs of fans?\n\nWe leverage this event to showcase all our latest and greatest technology. It\u2019s not only for the venue itself, the back office of the NFL, or the city around it. We\u2019re trying to put all the technology we\u2019ve been developing into the Super Bowl Weekend so that we can demonstrate all the new stuff. Several years ago, we started deploying 5G millimeter wave, and we just keep building on that.\n\nWe have the coach-to-coach communication for the second year. We have a private network for the broadcasters to communicate. And we turned on standalone 5G throughout New Orleans, which allows us to do 5G advanced features this year: slicing for first responders or creators, [for example,] can guarantee certain capabilities that they need for what they\u2019re trying to do on our networks.\n\nTwo things have happened since then. First, we are doing it for all their international games via our private 5G portable network that we take with us, and they keep expanding the international games, which makes it challenging for us as we have to work with local carriers. The other thing is, we\u2019re now working with the NFL on expanding the private network used for coach-to-coach to other things that they want to do, like back-office support or sideline communications. The referees now have watches that are connected to the private network. We have proved how a private network can give them end-to-end communication in a venue.\n\nObviously, broadcasters have shown they believe in bonded-cellular technologies from companies like LiveU or TVU Networks. They are hugely important for broadcasters everywhere. [We talked about] slicing. One of the dreams for broadcasters is the ability to roll out their broadcast cameras for an event and tap into a 5G wireless network.\n\nWhere are we on the roadmap to making that a reality? We\u2019re in the early innings, and there are three things that have to come together. The first is, you have to have the 5G core to support it. We launched that nationwide last year, so the core now has all the capabilities necessary to support 5G advanced features.\n\nThe second thing is, you have to have the radio access network to support the 5G advanced features. We\u2019ve taken a bit of a different approach than some of our competitors in that. Our view is, if we\u2019re going to offer these 5G advanced features, we need to do them on our mid-band or high-band spectrum because, if it\u2019s on the low-band spectrum, you might as well use 4G LTE. Our view was, let\u2019s build out the mid-band spectrum across the nation, get as much of the population covered as we can, and turn that spectrum on with standalone services. That\u2019s kind of our strategy: make our standalone network a true differentiated experience that I could support with the great mid-band spectrum. We have the C-band spectrum or millimeter wave for certain applications, such as venues.\n\nAnd then there is the third layer: the devices that support it. Today, I think, Samsung S21 and Apple 14 or newer cellphones have SA capability. But what we have to work on with the ecosystems of backpacks that may have a 5G chip is to get them to support standalone networks. I think that is where the industry is probably the furthest behind: having devices that support standalone networks.\n\nWhat can be done to speed that along?\n\nThere are things we can do, like RedCap (or reduced-capacity) 5G, which means the core doesn\u2019t need to support the kind of complex functions on a smartphone. We could reduce the form factor and reduce the cost. Our core now supports RedCap, and we\u2019re working with all the device manufacturers to bring the price and form factors down for those 5G SA-capable devices so they can be put into backpacks and other things.\n\nAnd the challenge there is that someone needs to manufacture devices with those capabilities but won\u2019t do it unless there is a solid potential customer base who can support the manufacture of those devices.\n\nExactly. Look at the tablets that are used on the sidelines by the coaches and players at NFL games as an example. It\u2019s a Microsoft tablet today, but it doesn\u2019t support 5G millimeter wave. We and the NFL need to work with Microsoft to get those devices to support these new capabilities if we want to put them on the private network. That\u2019s just one example of what has to happen.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss Sunday, when there will be around 83,000 people in the stadium and there will be a lot of outbound and inbound traffic. How are you setting up the network?\n\nPart of what we do in the lead-up to a Super Bowl is to have lots of dry runs as we build out the platform and to watch how it is used during an NFL game or when the Sugar Bowl was here. The real test of what you\u2019re talking about was when Taylor Swift [performed] here: you literally had 80,000 people live-streaming the whole concert. I don\u2019t know who they\u2019re streaming it to exactly, but it was the first time in my career \u2014 and I\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years \u2014 when the uplink during the event was larger than the downlink. Our view is, the future of 5G and beyond is the uplink and we need to continue to figure out how to make that more and more robust because more and more people will be streaming these events. We\u2019ll be sharing these things.\n\nI\u2019ve been using Meta glasses, and I absolutely envision that, in the next couple of years, this will be my personal assistant and, as a result, will be streaming what I\u2019m seeing all the time so that it can help me see what I see and what I\u2019m working through.\n\nSo how are you \u201cload balancing\u201d for upload vs download this Sunday?\n\nFor the Super Bowl, when we deploy our millimeter wave, we normally set up in an 80-20 ratio: 80% downlink spectrum usage, 20% uplink. We\u2019ve changed those parameters and will be tuning it until game day, seeing how that works best for the environment. We have two layers of millimeter-wave spectrum: the 28 GHz layer will be 50-50, and the 39 GHz layer will be 80-20.",

Previously, you needed the high-end plan to be eligible for a device so Verizon has opened this one up to a much wider audience.\n\nOn top of that, you can still throw in a free iPad and Apple Watch SE as bonus gifts \u2013 a promotion that the carrier has dabbled with regularly over the past few months.

Right now, no trades are needed at all to get this device for free alongside a new line on either a Plus or Ultimate plan. The carrier offered this deal before but that was tied to the super-pricey Ultimate plan only and not the mid-tier Plus plan. Subsequently, this promo is now more obtainable for those on a budget and you can still throw in a free Apple Watch and iPad as bonus gifts. Note: you need to pay extra per month for accessory cellular lines if you claim these freebies.\n\nIf for whatever reason this Verizon deal on the iPhone 16 isn't doing it for you, note that you can get an almost-identical promotion on the Galaxy S25 too.\n\nRight now, this brand new Android flagship is available for free under the same terms alongside a Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE. You're getting about the same value in terms of extras here so it's a great option if you'd like to try something a little different.\n\nMore great Verizon deals to check out today\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25: free with a trade-in and unlimited plan, plus free tablet and watch at Verizon\n\nVerizon's deal on the new Galaxy S25 is easily one of the strongest carrier options on the market right now. The setup of this deal is essentially the same as the one on the iPhone 16 above. All you need is a new line on either a Plus or Ultimate unlimited plan and you can claim a free device without needing to trade in.

            "content": "Dividends are a strategy that requires patience, with rewards unfolding over time. For instance, if you had invested a dollar in the broader market in 1927 and didn\u2019t reinvest any dividends, it would now be worth $243. However, if dividends had been reinvested, that same dollar would have grown to $3,737. The good news is that you don't need to wait a century to see the growth potential of dividend stocks, as the near-term outlook is positive. A report from AGF Investments notes that global monetary easing in the latter half of 2024 has driven bond yields lower, making them less appealing compared to dividend-paying stocks. Moreover, companies that distribute higher dividends tend to have more financial leverage, and with lower bond yields, they can better manage their interest expenses, enhancing their financial performance and supporting continued dividend growth.\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks lagged behind as the AI boom and growing interest in tech stocks shifted investor focus elsewhere. The Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, underperformed relative to the broader market. However, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term potential of dividend stocks. This confidence is driven by the substantial cash reserves many US companies hold, which provide a strong foundation for sustaining or increasing dividend payouts. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute reports that large-cap US companies collectively hold over $2.4 trillion in cash, creating significant opportunities to start or enhance dividends.\n\nAlmost all of the companies in the index distribute dividends to their shareholders, with some having stronger dividend records than others. While there is a lot of focus on AI-driven capital gains, it's important to keep in mind that dividends have consistently been a key component of total returns. Over the long term, their importance grows. From 1987 to the end of 2023, about 55% of market returns have been generated from reinvested dividends.\n\nThe Dow is a highly recognized and influential stock market index that tracks the performance of 30 publicly traded companies listed on US stock exchanges, representing a wide range of industries. In the past 12 months, the index has surged by nearly 16%, and it has delivered a return of over 5% since the start of 2025.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChris Senyek, Chief Investment Strategist at Wolfe Research, offers an alternative approach to investing in dividend stocks. While most investors focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek recommends also considering companies that are starting to pay dividends or those that have recently cut their payouts. A new dividend often signals that management is confident in its ability to sustain earnings and cash flow, while also appealing to a broader group of investors.\n\nSenyek also pointed out that stocks of companies that reduce their dividends typically underperform before the cut, align with the broader market afterward, and then start to outperform about six months later. The strategy is to identify companies that might be at risk of cutting their dividends and reassess those that have already made cuts in recent months. To predict potential dividend cuts, Senyek looks for companies with high dividend yields, significant debt, and high payout ratios. For companies that might begin paying dividends, he focuses on those with strong free cash flow yields, active share buybacks, and manageable debt levels. With this in mind, we will now take a look at some of the best Dow dividend stocks according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we examined the companies within the Dow Jones index and identified companies that pay dividends to shareholders. From that group, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of February 6. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(VZ) the Best Dividend Stock on Robinhood?\n\nA smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nUpside Potential as of February 6: 16.23%\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company that provides a wide range of communication services to its consumers. The company continued to benefit from strong wireless growth as seen in its recent quarterly earnings. Its wireless segment remains its primary revenue driver, posting a 3.1% year-over-year increase to $20 billion. Notably, this marked the 18th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. The company reported 568,000 total postpaid net additions during the quarter, including 426,000 net additions for wireless retail postpaid phones. Verizon also highlighted that Q4 saw its highest postpaid phone gross additions in five years.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) also demonstrated a solid cash position in FY24. The company generated $37 billion in operating cash flow during the year and reported a free cash flow of $19.8 billion, an increase from $18.7 billion the previous year. Analysts remain positive about its growth prospects, especially after its collaboration with NVIDIA to create an AI-powered enterprise solution aimed at optimizing AI applications on its secure 5G private networks with private Mobile Edge Computing. In addition, the company is advancing other AI-driven initiatives, including network slicing and satellite connectivity, to expand revenue opportunities and strengthen its market position.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), one of the best dividend stocks on our list, currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 18 years. As of February 6, the stock has a dividend yield of 6.80%.\n\nWith a collective stake value of over $3.2 billion, 57 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held positions in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) at the end of Q3 2024. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall VZ ranks 5th on our list of the best Dow Jones dividend stocks to invest in according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

It has its roots in the original Bell system and is one of only 3 \u201cbaby Bells\u201d to exist today. The company was spun off from the original Bell network as Bell Atlantic when it was split into 7 companies in 1984. The original home range was from New Jersey to Virginia but, ironically, shortly after the split the baby bells, including Bell Atlantic, began to merge together in order to expand their territories.\n\nBell Atlantic acquired NYNEX, another baby Bell, in a move that expanded operations into New York and New England. MCI was also added, expanding the long-distance services, then the company acquired until-then independent operator GTE and became a national carrier. The company changed its name to Verizon following the GTE merger and it is a blend of the Latin word veritas which means Truth and Horizon.\n\nOver the years, Verizon has expanded its territory and its offerings to include mobile, internet and entertainment. Among the more notable were the purchase and merging of AOL and Yahoo! which were later spun off in a sale to Apollo Global Management. Among the more important changes the company has made was to sell off its land-based wirelines. Verizon began selling off its land-based wirelines in 2005 in order to focus more fully on mobile and Internet technology.\n\nToday, Verizon offers communications, information technology, and entertainment products to consumers globally. The company operates in 2 key segments that include Consumer and Business. The Consumer segment provides wireless connectivity, internet access for mobile devices, and wireless and mobile devices including those for the IoT. As of the end of the year 2021, the company laid claim to more than 143 million retail subscribers and was the largest mobile provider by almost 30%.\n\nThe Business segment provides connectivity at the enterprise level that includes mobile, networking, Internet access, VOIP and video, security and IoT. As of 2021, this segment had more than 27 million wireless and 477,000 broadband connections. Both the Consumer and Business segments are being upgraded to the 5G protocol. At the end of 2022 more than 175 million users were covered by the service.\n\nVerizon is the US's 24th largest company by revenue and a member of both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company has paid a dividend every quarter since it went public in 2000 and had increased the payment for 18 consecutive years as of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Guillermo Salinas, Verizon\u2019s senior director of network performance, told RCR Wireless News that planning for this deployment began roughly three and half years ago and that it has also invested heavily in network densification across the entire city.\n\nSpecifically, he explained that Verizon has installed tons of small cells in Woldenberg Park \u2014 which is where the French Quarter Festival takes place \u2014 as well as all across Bourbon Street, and throughout the French quarter. In addition, the telco has deployed more than 560 miles of fiber in the greater New Orleans area. \u201cThis is enough fiber to wrap around the Caesar super dome like 869 times \u2014 one of my guys counted,\u201d Salinas said. \u201cThe city gets about 18 million tourists every year. These systems across the city will help not just for the Super Bowl, but also for events like Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest. These investments are here to stay. They are not just for one event; they\u2019re for the community.\u201d\n\nBack inside the Superdome, which can accommodate more than 70,000 people, Verizon mounted 42 MatSing ball antennas to the stadium\u2019s catwalk rings on the ceiling and installed a 750-watt backup generator in case of a power failure. More 4G LTE, 5G, mmWave and C-band spectrum has also been added.\n\n\u201cWe will also be displaying out Frontline assets,\u201d Salinas said, adding that these are primarily temporary fixtures that provide connectivity during natural disasters and other public safety scenarios. He said that while there hasn\u2019t been much need for such temporary assets at the superdome due to the amount of planning, the assets will be there if needed and will be ready to go at \u201ca moment\u2019s notice.\u201d\n\nFor those attending the Super Bowl, the upgraded network will mean the ability to live-stream the game as well as use event-specific smartphone applications designed to enhance the live fan experience. \u201cLatency is one big thing we have been able to break through. Our latency is so good now that we can do many things in real-time,\u201d claimed Salinas.\n\nVerizon has been working with the NFL for a long time, developing use cases like coach-to-coach communications with a managed private wireless solution in all stadiums, and various the fan-oriented experiences like low-latency video \u2014 productized as Verizon 5G Multi-View \u2014 which enables fans to view up to seven simultaneous camera angles, allowing them watch a game on their phone from different angles and go back and review moments from the game. At some stadiums, Verizon deployed a technology that divides crowds into sectors \u201clike slices of a pie,\u201d allowing engineers to adjust each slice individually to curate the network performance based on where stadium attendees move and how they use data. Additionally, Verizon said that its 5G network allows stadium operators to enabling autonomous or cashier-less retail, accelerated access and crowd analytics, all of which further improve the fan in-stadium experience.",

Why Trust Us?\n\nName: Hans Vestberg\n\nAge: 59\n\nHometown: New York City\n\nOccupation:\n\nTime Running: 20-plus years\n\nReason for Running: Running is my essential training\u2014both physically and mentally. Over many years, running has given me time to reflect and bring the best from myself every day.\n\nI\u2019ve always been an athlete, and from childhood into my mid-20s, I worked to become a professional team handball player, reaching semipro level in Sweden, Brazil, and Chile. Eventually, I chaired the Swedish Handball Federation and founded the Jan Vestberg Handball Academy, named after my father, who was my childhood coach and the greatest leader I have ever known.\n\nLike many hopeful athletes, I had to find another way to make a living. Fortunately, my athletic career helped me get into business and develop leadership skills.\n\nI started running over 20 years ago because it was the best way to do physical exercise on my terms, especially as my career ramped up. There is always somewhere I can run, no matter where my work takes me. I use apps to find trails and I often get asked about my favorite and most memorable place in the world to run. The answer is always Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro. It\u2019s truly a unique running experience. The vibrant atmosphere and diverse community remind me of my time in Latin America and reinforce the importance of embracing different perspectives. Of course, I also love running closer to home in New York and Sweden, each having their own unique sense of place and connection.\n\n\n\nRelated Story There\u2019s a Secret to Train Your Brain to Run Longer\n\nI have tracked my training meticulously for decades, documenting every workout in a spreadsheet, and on my Garmin watch. This data-driven approach mirrors how I manage businesses\u2014setting goals, measuring progress, and constantly evolving. Early on, I aimed for consistency, making sure I had some form of physical activity almost daily, although I don\u2019t follow any rigid training plans. That analytical approach definitely carries over into how I approach business challenges.\n\nMy week is pretty structured. It takes serious planning to balance leading a company while maintaining a consistent running schedule. I\u2019m very flexible about when running can happen in my day. I just get outside whenever I can, because adaptability is key. Being able to adjust to changing circumstances is a crucial skill, whether you\u2019re leading a team or navigating a tricky trail. The bottom line is, making running a non-negotiable part of my routine keeps me energized, focused, and ready to tackle whatever comes my way, both in business and in life.\n\nI tend to run solo, but if I run with someone, it\u2019s usually with my wife. I also enjoy the energy of larger races, using them as motivation and incorporating playlists timed to my target finish time. Every year I plan a couple of races, usually with New York Road Runners. I\u2019ve always found the energy of shared experiences translates powerfully from sports to business.\n\nRelated Story How to Choose Between Morning and Evening Runs\n\nThe races that I remember most are the 2016 New York Marathon, which my wife and I ran together. It was a once in a lifetime experience, truly amazing. The Brooklyn Half Marathon is another favorite. There\u2019s an incredible sense of community among the thousands of runners, all striving toward a common goal. That shared energy is inspiring. Finally, the Verizon Corporate Classic 5K in Morristown, New Jersey, is more than just a race; it's a chance to connect with colleagues outside the office, building camaraderie, and strengthen our team.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t overstate how essential running is to my well-being. I\u2019m not myself without it. I had a shoulder injury recently that kept me from running for a few days, and I felt it. It really emphasized how important physical and mental release is for me to function at my best, both personally and professionally.\n\n\n\nI partake in all kinds of sports\u2014skiing, cycling, golfing, and weightlifting. However, running offers a unique combination of physical challenge, mental clarity, and crucial \u2018me time\u2019 to recharge and strategize. It has become less about pure athletic pursuit and more about a holistic approach to well-being and leadership.\n\nThese three tips have made my running journey successful:\n\n1. Consistency\n\nJust like in business, consistent effort is key to long-term success. Even short runs maintain momentum and build a strong foundation.\n\n\n\n2. Planning\n\nScheduling runs like important meetings ensures they happen. It sounds simple, but this kind of intentional planning is how you build discipline and actually achieve your goals.\n\n3. Exploration and variety\n\nExploring new routes and incorporating different types of training keeps the experience engaging. It\u2019s like taking on new challenges in your career\u2014it makes things interesting and helps you avoid plateaus.\n\nHans\u2019 Must-Have Gear\n\n\u2192 : These are great wireless headphones that stay in place.\n\n\u2192 : I love this watch because it captures all my necessary data.\n\n\u2192 : This keeps my phone from jumping around.",

It has its roots in the original Bell system and is one of only 3 \u201cbaby Bells\u201d to exist today. The company was spun off from the original Bell network as Bell Atlantic when it was split into 7 companies in 1984. The original home range was from New Jersey to Virginia but, ironically, shortly after the split the baby bells, including Bell Atlantic, began to merge together in order to expand their territories.\n\nBell Atlantic acquired NYNEX, another baby Bell, in a move that expanded operations into New York and New England. MCI was also added, expanding the long-distance services, then the company acquired until-then independent operator GTE and became a national carrier. The company changed its name to Verizon following the GTE merger and it is a blend of the Latin word veritas which means Truth and Horizon.\n\nOver the years, Verizon has expanded its territory and its offerings to include mobile, internet and entertainment. Among the more notable were the purchase and merging of AOL and Yahoo! which were later spun off in a sale to Apollo Global Management. Among the more important changes the company has made was to sell off its land-based wirelines. Verizon began selling off its land-based wirelines in 2005 in order to focus more fully on mobile and Internet technology.\n\nToday, Verizon offers communications, information technology, and entertainment products to consumers globally. The company operates in 2 key segments that include Consumer and Business. The Consumer segment provides wireless connectivity, internet access for mobile devices, and wireless and mobile devices including those for the IoT. As of the end of the year 2021, the company laid claim to more than 143 million retail subscribers and was the largest mobile provider by almost 30%.\n\nThe Business segment provides connectivity at the enterprise level that includes mobile, networking, Internet access, VOIP and video, security and IoT. As of 2021, this segment had more than 27 million wireless and 477,000 broadband connections. Both the Consumer and Business segments are being upgraded to the 5G protocol. At the end of 2022 more than 175 million users were covered by the service.\n\nVerizon is the US's 24th largest company by revenue and a member of both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company has paid a dividend every quarter since it went public in 2000 and had increased the payment for 18 consecutive years as of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Regardless of whether you're looking for that next upgrade or a completely new plan, you'll be able to easily compare all your options (and available discounts) right here.\n\nRight now is a superb time to be checking out Verizon deals, too. Not only have we just added the latest Galaxy S25 flagships from Samsung, but the carrier's deals on iPhones have also just been refreshed. Currently, for example, you don't even need to trade-in to get up to four iPhone 16 Pro's for free alongside a new line on one of the carrier's MyPlan unlimited plans. Unlike before, this promotion is now available on the budget 'Welcome' plan, which makes it a much more obtainable deal than previously.\n\nAlongside Verizon deals for devices, you'll also find great options for simply porting your number over to the carrier. Got your own device? The good news is you can currently port over up to 4 lines onto an unlimited data plan and get each line for as little as $25 per month. Verizon has also been massively improving its deals on home internet packages over recent months. Right now, for example, you can get either a 43-inch Samsung TV or the excellent Meta Quest 3S VR headset - both of which are worth $300 if you bought them outright.\n\nWhile you're here, if you're interested in comparing these promotions to what other carriers are offering, head on over to our main best cell phone deals. If you're still unsure about whether Verizon is the carrier for you or need a little more advice regarding phones, head on over to our best Verizon plans and the best Verizon phones pages respectively.\n\nBrowse all the latest deals at Verizon now\n\nThe best Verizon deals available today\n\niPhone deals\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro: free with a new unlimited line at Verizon\n\nVerizon has just posted what's easily one of its best deals yet on the excellent iPhone 16 Pro. Firstly, you can get this device (which is still worth $1,000) for free alongside a new unlimited data line. That's a great deal, albeit one that we've seen the carrier feature previously. What is new, however, is that this particular promo is now available on the carrier's budget-friendly Welcome Unlimited plan - which means you can get up to four devices for free alongside a plan that costs just $25/mo per line($100 in total). If none of the above appeals, then you can instead trade-in for a free device and get a free Apple Watch and iPad as bonus gifts (accessory cellular lines are also required).\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max: $33.33 $5/mo with an unlimited plan, plus free iPad and Apple Watch at Verizon\n\nIf you like the look of the above promotion on the iPhone 16 Pro but would prefer a larger device, then you're in luck. This week's best Verizon deals also extend to the excellent iPhone 16 Pro Max. This flagship device is available for just $5/mo alongside a new line on an Ultimate unlimited plan as well as a free iPad and Apple Watch if you're willing to pay the small monthly surcharge for their cellular lines.\n\nApple iPhone 16e: $5/mo with an unlimited plan, or up to $600 off with a trade-in at Verizon\n\nVerizon's opening iPhone 16e promotion features two deals to check out. You can either trade-in an old device to potentially get the device for free thanks to a maximum rebate of up to $600 off, or you can instead just get it on an unlimited line for $5/mo. Both are pretty good but it's worth noting that Verizon is currently giving the standard iPhone 16 away for free on either a Plus or Ultimate plan. Unless you're going for a line on the basic Welcome unlimited plan, then it definitely makes sense to opt for the pricier flagship device!\n\nApple iPhone 16: free with a new line, plus free iPad and Apple Watch with an unlimited plan at Verizon\n\nAnd. here's that excellent Verizon deal on the standard iPhone 16 to compare to. As stated, the carrier is currently giving this one away with a new line on either a Plus or Ultimate plan and you can also throw in a free Apple Watch SE and a free iPad. The free accessories are fantastic here but do note that you will need to pay a little extra for some accessory cellular line, which are required for you to claim the devices free of charge.\n\nSee all the iPhone deals at Verizon\n\nAndroid deals\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: free with an unlimited plan, plus free tablet and watch\n\nVerizon's just surprised us with the best deal yet on the stunning Galaxy S25 Ultra. Almost unbelievably, right now you don't even need a trade-in rebate to get this stunning premium device for free. All you need is a new line on the Ultimate unlimited plan and the carrier is willing to waive the entire $1,200 cost of this device over the duration of your plan. Also, as a bonus you can throw in a free Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE, although note that cellular lines are paid separately for accessories and required.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Plus: free with a trade-in and unlimited plan, plus free tablet and watch at Verizon\n\nVerizon's deal on the new Galaxy S25 Plus is easily one of the strongest carrier options on the market right now. The setup of this deal is essentially the same as the one on the iPhone 16 above. All you need is a new line on either a Plus or Ultimate unlimited plan and you can claim a free device without needing to trade in. On top of that, Verizon is also offering a free Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE as bonus gifts, although you will have to pay a little extra per month on associated cellular lines if you claim these.\n\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: free with new line, plus free Pixel Watch and tablet Verizon\n\nIt's not just the Galaxy S25 Ultra that's received a great deal with this week's Verizon promotions - you'll also be able to snag the Pixel 9 Pro XL for free alongside a new line on an Ultimate plan. This is again the first time we've seen this premium device for free without the usual trade-in rebate and you can also throw in a free Pixel Watch 2 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE if you're willing to pay for the associated cellular lines.\n\nGoogle Pixel 9: free with new line, plus free Pixel Watch and tablet Verizon\n\nLike the look of the above Verizon deals but don't want a line on the expensive Ultimate plan? Today's promotion on the Pixel 9 could be a good option. You can get this device for free on a Plus line instead, which should be a lot easier on the wallet over the duration of a 36-month plan. Note, you can also throw in a free Pixel Watch 2 and Galaxy tablet if you want some cheap accessories, too.\n\nSee all the Android devices available at Verizon\n\nUpgrade & plan deals\n\nVerizon: add a second line to your account for $10 per month\n\nVerizon's latest deal allows existing customers to add a second line to their phone for just $10 per month. That's a second line with unlimited data, texts and calls for a super low price. Note, however, that you will need a dual-SIM compatible smartphone and this is a limited-time-only promotion - so don't hang around if you're interested.\n\nSwitch: get up to four lines for $25/mo\n\nThe perfect multi-line Verizon deal for those looking to set up some new lines at the carrier. This particular promotion will get you $180 off up to four lines over a 36-month duration when you bring your devices over. Unlike with other similar promotions at other carriers you can keep your phone number with this deal.\n\nSwitch: get $540 when you bring your own device\n\nDon't want a new device? No problem - Verizon also offers up to $540 promo credit for those who bring their device over from a rival carrier. Note that this credit is applied over 36 months and only applies to unlimited data plans. You'll also need to be on the Unlimited Plus plan to get the full amount (you'll get $180 with the Unlimited Plus plan).\n\nPlan deal: students save up to $25/mo with unlimited plans\n\nVerizon offers a hefty discount for actively enrolled students, with a saving of up to $25 per month on the Welcome Unlimited plan. From the small print, it appears that you can have up to two lines with this promo and it also applies if you bring your own device. You will, however, need to log in to prove your eligibility.\n\nSee all plans and upgrade deals at Verizon\n\nInternet deals\n\nVerizon home internet: get a free Samsung TV or Meta Quest 3S\n\nVerizon's deals don't just cover phones this week, you'll also find great freebies available with its 5G Home internet packages. Right now, new customers can either get a free 43-inch Samsung TV or a Meta Quest 3S VR headset when they switch over from a rival carrier. Of the two, I'd probably go for the headset here as the TV is on the small side but having an extra TV could be handy depending on your needs. Both gifts are worth $300 so they aren't small bonuses by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nVerizon FIOS: get a free Samsung TV or Meta Quest 3S\n\nSick of slow internet? If you can get it in your local area Verizon FIOS is a fantastic choice with its incredible fiber-optic speeds. Right now, those same freebies are available with these super-speedy home internet packages. For a limited time only, you'll be able to get either a free Samsung 43-inch TV or a Meta Quest 3S headset, both valued at around $300.\n\nVerizon Fios internet: from $25/mo when you bundle in a mobile plan\n\nVerizon deals don't just stop at mobile devices, they also extend to home internet packages. If you're looking to cut down on your bills in their entirety, it's a great idea to consider switching up your pricey home internet setup to a more consolidated option. While Fios by itself starts at $49.99/mo as a standalone package, those with an existing Verizon mobile plan can bundle in their home internet for as little as $25/mo, a significant saving.\n\nTablet deals\n\nApple iPad (2022): $180 off with a trade, or free with an iPhone purchase\n\nSuperb iPhone bundle option: The 10th generation iPad is a great choice for an everyday tablet at Verizon with the carrier's option to bundle it in for free alongside any eligible iPhone purchase. While the cheapest device in the range, this one is a great pick if you're looking for a quality do-it-all tablet for streaming, games, and productivity. It's not as powerful as the other tablets (see below), but it'll give you great bang for the buck.\n\nApple iPad Pro 11 (2024): $180 off with a trade, or $280 off with an iPhone purchase\n\nThe brand new iPad Pro 11 is available with a superb deal at Verizon this week, with either a healthy trade-in rebate of up to $180 or a massive $280 discount alongside an eligible iPhone purchase. With a powerful M4 chipset, gorgeous OLED display, and incredibly wafer-thin design, the latest iPad Pro is the slate of choice for those in need of serious power. See this same deal on the 13-inch model.\n\nApple iPad Air 11 (2024): $180 off with a trade, or $280 off with an iPhone purchase\n\nLooking for a premium Apple tablet but don't want to go for the super pricey Pro models? The latest iPad Air is a superb choice - especially since this week's Verizon deals also offer some great ways to save. Either trade-in for a discount of up to $180 or get a respectable $280 off with an eligible 5G iPhone purchase. Both are great deals, and enough to significantly cut the latest Air's price tag right down to size. See this same deal on the 13-inch model.\n\nApple iPad mini (2021): $180 off with a trade, or $280 off with an iPhone purchase\n\nAnd, if you prefer a smaller-sized tablet, that same excellent Verizon trade-in deal is also available on the latest Apple iPad Mini. At just 8-inches, this tablet is much smaller and more bag-friendly than the other iPads. As you'd expect, however, it's still really powerful and features the same great design as its bigger siblings.\n\nSee all tablet deals at Verizon\n\nAccessory deals\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: free with Galaxy phones, or up to $180 off with a trade-in\n\nLike with the Apple Watch SE, this week's Verizon deals are also offering an exceptional promotion on the brand new Galaxy Watch 7. Right now, you can bundle this one in with any of the latest flagship Samsung Galaxy devices as long as you're eligible and willing to pay the $5/mo extra for a cellular line. Note, if you want this device by itself, then you can also trade-in an older smartwatch for discount of up to $180 off.\n\nApple Watch Series 9: up to $180 off with a trade-in at Verizon\n\nThe Apple Watch series 9 is the latest and greatest smartwatch from the brand, complete with a superb always-on display, speedy chip, and innovative new health-tracking features. Right now, the carrier is offering a trade-in rebate of up to $180 on this model, which essentially matches the similar promotions you'll find on the iPads right now.\n\nApple Watch SE 2022: up to $180 off with a trade-in at Verizon\n\nThis week's best Verizon deals also cover the excellent Apple Watch SE - the more 'budget' orientated device of the two new Apple smartwatches. Verizon has experimented with giving this one away for free alongside the high-end iPhones in recent months but right now it's discounts are locked behind a trade-in. This is still a good deal if you need a new smartwatch but we'd recommend checking-in over Black Friday if you want to pair up a free Apple Watch with your shiny new Apple device.\n\nSee all the accessory deals at Verizon\n\nIf you haven't found the Verizon deals you're looking for this week, feel free to bookmark this page and return next week.

The message back typically takes five to six seconds.\n\nFrom the satellite, Hyoungjun Cho, solution engineer for Skylo Technologies, stated data from the message is sent over the company\u2019s RAN and cloud infrastructure to the Google Android system and then to Garmin.\n\nSaladino explained the intent is to have it function in the same way as other text messaging services.\n\n\u201cIt should be very straightforward and feel natural,\u201d Saladino said. \u201cWe worked really hard to make this like an integrated experience that is easy to use and intuitive.\u201d\n\nThe only difference between the Samsung and the Pixel UIs is the latter has a green \u201cpointing\u201d icon that shows a user which direction to stand for the best satellite reception\n\nSkylo Technologies is also working with Verizon on adding text messaging for friends and family using SMS over satellite, which Saladino said both companies \u201chope to bring to market soon\u201d.\n\nIt is also developing a voice service that Saladino said the company could announce later this year or next year.\n\nSkylo Technologies currently covers 50 million square kilometres across four continents.\n\n\u201cWe hope to have an announcement in the coming weeks that expands upon that,\u201d Saladino stated.",

            "content": "In a suit filed by Verizon Group, the Delhi High Court has restrained third parties from misusing the company\u2019s name in connection with fake job opportunities with the aim of obtaining money from prospective candidates (Verizon Trademark Services LLC & Ors v Verizon Careers & Ors, 10 January 2025).\n\nCase details\n\nThe plaintiffs are part of Verizon, a world-renowned telecoms business and proprietor of the reputed trademark VERIZON. They filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court seeking injunctive relief for trademark infringement and passing off, alleging that the defendants had used Verizon\u2019s name and mark to orchestrate a fake recruitment process.\n\nIn November 2024, Verizon\u2019s Indian branch was contacted by a candidate claiming to have discussed a job opportunity with the defendants, which were said to have been using the Indian arm\u2019s former company name. Further investigation uncovered an elaborate ruse.\n\nAs part of the recruitment process, candidates would receive a link to TestGorilla \u2013 also arraigned as a defendant in the suit \u2013 an online assessment platform that features aptitude and behavioural modules. After completing the assessment, candidates would be notified that they had passed and were shortlisted for an interview. They would then receive a Google Meet link for the interview via email.\n\nCandidates would be asked technical questions during the interview, but the panel\u2019s camera would be off. Afterwards, they would receive a call informing them that they had passed and that an offer letter would follow \u2013 displaying the VERIZON mark. Candidates would then receive another call asking them to complete a TensorFlow course as part of the qualification requirements for the purported job.\n\nThe defendants had falsely represented that Verizon\u2019s Indian branch had a partnership with a software company, through which the course could be purchased at a discounted price of 23,000 Indian rupees (approximately US$266). Candidates would then be provided with a link to pay for the course.\n\nFortunately, the candidate in this case became suspicious of the defendants and did not make any payment. Verizon said that it had been contacted by two additional individuals who were similarly deceived.\n\nCourt decisions\n\nAggrieved by the defendants\u2019 unlawful use of its former corporate name and trademark to deceive candidates and threaten its brand reputation and trustworthiness, Verizon approached the Delhi High Court. Given that other unsuspecting candidates might fall prey to such schemes, Verizon sought immediate and urgent ex-parte injunctive relief to restrain the defendants from using the company\u2019s name for any services, including through websites and email addresses.\n\nAs well as TestGorilla, Verizon also impleaded other third parties \u2013 such as the domain-name registrar and Google \u2013 and sought orders against them to disclose all relevant details of the impugned activities.\n\nThe court was quick to grant the injunction on the first date of hearing, restraining the defendants from using Verizon\u2019s mark and directing third parties to furnish all available details relating to the case.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe Delhi High Court has granted similar relief in other cases, such as Eicher Motors v royalenfielddealerships.in & Ors (CS/COMM, 832, 2023), in which the defendants utilised the plaintiff\u2019s name and trademarks to offer false franchises to the public. This judgment and the court\u2019s recent decision highlight that while the digital age comes with persistent challenges, the courts are quick to adapt and rescue brand owners by granting necessary and expeditious relief.",

            "content": "Analysts typically recommend targeting dividend yields between 3% and 6%, as this range tends to offer the best balance of potential for both dividend growth and stock price appreciation. A report from Nuveen highlighted that global companies with moderate dividend yields (ranging from 0% to 3%) generally show stronger earnings growth, profitability, and profit margins compared to those with higher yields or no dividends at all. These factors also help reduce risk, particularly in times of market volatility.\n\nThis is a common challenge for investors, who often believe that companies with strong dividend growth don\u2019t offer high yields. However, this isn't necessarily the case. Many companies provide above-average dividend yields while also maintaining solid records of dividend growth. In fact, dividend yield plays an important role in sustaining dividend growth. For example, the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes companies that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years, has managed to maintain a high yield without sacrificing growth. Over the 26 years ending in 2023, the index consistently outperformed its benchmark while maintaining yields between 2% and 2.9%. On average, the index yielded 2.5%, notably higher than the market average of 1.8%, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nAn example of this is a report from Newton Investment Management, which found that high-yield dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during periods of high inflation between 1940 and 2021. The report also showed that portfolios with high-yield dividend stocks performed better than those with low or no dividends, with high-yield portfolios exceeding low-yield ones by 199 basis points and zero-yield portfolios by 330 basis points. While the findings are insightful, the report lacks details on the specific market conditions during these periods, offering only a general overview of high-yield stock performance. Analysts have closely studied how dividend stocks fare during market volatility, given the heightened need for consistent income. As a result, they recommend considering high-yield stocks only if these companies also demonstrate a solid track record of dividend growth.\n\nDividend investors have often debated the balance between high yields and dividend growth. Analysts tend to favor companies with robust dividend growth, advising investors to avoid the yield traps. However, many studies suggest that high dividend yields aren't necessarily a negative factor.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother study by Wellington Management highlighted the historical outperformance of high-yield stocks. The report analyzed dividend-paying stocks in the broader market index from 1930 to 2019 and grouped them into five categories based on their dividend yields. The top 20% of dividend payers performed the best, followed by the moderate dividend group, both surpassing the broader market in multiple periods. However, the lower dividend groups showed less consistent performance and generally underperformed the index. Given this, we will now take a look at some of the best dividend stocks with over 5% yield.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and picked 12 dividend stocks that have yields above 5%, as of February 5. These companies have strong histories of paying dividends to shareholders. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(VZ) the Best Dividend Stock on Robinhood?\n\nA smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nDividend Yield as of February 5: 6.76%\n\nAn American multinational telecommunications company, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has attracted investor interest over the years due to its consistent innovation and strong cash flow. In FY24, it reported an operating cash flow of $37 billion and a free cash flow of $19.8 billion, up from $18.7 billion the previous year. Analysts are optimistic about its future, particularly following its partnership with NVIDIA to develop an AI-driven enterprise solution that enhances AI applications on its secure 5G private networks with private Mobile Edge Computing. In addition, the company is exploring other AI-driven initiatives, such as network slicing and satellite connectivity, to generate new revenue and improve its competitive position.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) recently announced its Q4 2024 earnings, reporting revenue of $35.7 billion, a 1.6% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was fueled by strong customer additions in both mobile wireless and internet services. In the mobile wireless sector, the company gained 568,000 net postpaid phone subscribers, up from 449,000 in the previous year\u2019s quarter. Revenue for this segment rose 3.1% year-over-year to reach $20 billion, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Its quarterly dividend comes in at $0.6775 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.76%, as of February 5.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024, 57 hedge funds owned investments in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), worth over $3.2 billion in total. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall VZ ranks 2nd on our list of the best dividend stocks with over 5% yield. While we acknowledge the potential for VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Verizon lists three different unlimited options on its main phone plan page, and if you wander over to prepaid phone plans, you'll see two more unlimited data plans. Pretty confusing, huh?\n\nFortunately, I can answer any questions you have about Verizon's different unlimited options. I handle all the research into cell plans for Tom's Guide \u2014 and not just Verizon but for all U.S. phone carriers big and small. For that reason, I know that Verizon has some of the best unlimited data plans out there, and I can explain the differences between each one. Even better, I can tell you how Verizon's offerings compare to the best cell phone plans available right now.\n\nIn fact, I have special insight into Verizon's wireless coverage. I've been a customer for more than a dozen years now, so I know all about how their plans have changed and what separates the current offerings. You have a choice of basic coverage with 5G service through Unlimited Welcome or more costly options like Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Ultimate that include more perks. We'll discuss that further below.\n\nBut for quick reference, anyone who needs just one line of data will have to decide whether they want the faster 5G coverage that comes with Unlimited Plus or the lower cost of Unlimited Welcome. That latter plan is certainly the better pick for families, thanks to appealing discounts on multi-line plans.\n\nIf you don't need unlimited data, I would recommend taking a close look at Verizon's 15GB prepaid plan, which gives you a lot of data for a reasonable monthly rate. And you could also turn to low-cost carriers that use Verizon's network but charge less for service. (We'll briefly look at those options, too.)\n\nLooking for more ways to save at Verizon? We routinely check for the best Verizon phone deals. (A lot of those offers require you to commit to an unlimited data plan, so that's another reason to familiarize yourself with Verizon's different options.) You also can find some decent discounts with our Verizon promo codes, so it's worth taking a look at them before you proceed through the checkout.\n\nThe quick list\n\nBest overall plan Verizon Unlimited Welcome View at Verizon Unlimited data for $80 at Verizon I recommend Verizon's Unlimited Plus plan for individuals, as it includes access to Verizon's fast Ultra Wideband 5G. That's certainly appealing if you live in an area with Ultra Wideband coverage, but $80/month may be a lot for some people to pay, especially if they're not in an area with a lot of Ultra Wideband coverage around. In that instance, you may prefer Unlimited Welcome, which is $15 cheaper and does include 5G coverage, albeit from Verizon's slower nationwide network. Read more below Best prepaid plan 2. Verizon 15GB prepaid plan View at Verizon 15GB for $35 at Verizon Verizon's prepaid plans cram in a lot of data for the price, making this option one of the best prepaid phone plans out there. With this plan, you get 15GB of data for $45 a month but if you set up AutoPay, that price drops to $35 after the first payment. Signing up for autopay means you no longer get Verizon's loyalty discounts for keeping your prepaid account with the carrier, but the autopay discount is steeper than it was before and it's also applied to your bill faster. Read more below Best family plan 3. Verizon Unlimited Welcome plan View at Verizon Unlimited data for $120 at Verizon (four lines) As I've noted, Unlimited Welcome starts at $65/month for one line of data and offers just the basics (though, as with Unlimited Plus, you can tack on extras through $10 add-ons). For households on a budget, Unlimited Welcome is the most cost-effective way to get unlimited data as four lines will cost just $120/month. Discounts from trading in your current phone can lower that monthly rate further when you switch.

Verizon Unlimited Plus plan The best Verizon phone plan for unlimited data Specifications Amount of data: Unlimited Cost: $80/month (includes $10 autopay discount) Family cost (4 lines): $180/month Perks: Fast Ultra Wideband 5G coverage, 30GB of hotspot data Today's Best Deals Shop Verizon Unlimited Plans Reasons to buy + Verizon's fastest 5G coverage + 30GB hotspot data + Unlimited premium data Reasons to avoid - $10 add-ons can add up - More expensive than T-Mobile's comparable plan\n\nThe best Verizon phone plan comes down to whether you want faster data and more perks or a lower monthly bill. In the case of the former, get Unlimited Plus. It costs $80/month, and includes access to Verizon's Ultra Wideband 5G service, which the carrier says is 5x faster than its regular 5G coverage. Unlimited Plus includes 30GB of hotspot data, and Verizon never slows down your speeds even if its network is congested.\n\nUnlimited Welcome is the cheaper option at $65/month. It does come with 5G coverage, though on that slower network that lags behind Ultra Wideband service. You won't get any hotspot data, and your speeds can be throttled if Verizon's network has a lot of traffic on it. If those issues don't matter to you, you'll save $180 over the course of a year by opting for Welcome over Plus.\n\nBoth Unlimited Plus and Unlimited have access to the same perks via add-ons you can sign up for at will. Verizon offers things like Disney's streaming bundle, a family subscription to Apple Music, Travel Passes for international travel and cloud storage as $10/month add-ons. The good news is you can mix and match the add-ons you like and even drop them in months you don't need them. The bad news is that a lot of add-ons can supersize your monthly phone bill if you're not judicious about what you add and dropping that service in months where you don't plan to use it.\n\nYour other unlimited data option is Unlimited Ultimate. It costs $90/month for one line of data after an autopay discount, but you get 60GB of hotspot data and unlimited calls and texting when you travel overseas. Unlimited Ultimate also includes 10GB of international premium data each month to use overseas, making it one of the best international phone plans if you do a lot of traveling.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Verizon unlimited data plans for individuals Row 0 - Cell 0 Monthly price for one line Notes Unlimited Welcome $65 Data can be slowed at any time; 5G coverage is slower than on other plans Unlimited Plus $80 No caps on data; 30GB of hotspot data; access to Verizon's Ultra Wideband 5G Unlimited Ultimate $90 60GB of hotspot data; Ultra Wideband 5G access; international travel perks\n\nThe best prepaid Verizon phone plan\n\n(Image credit: Verizon)\n\n2. Verizon 15GB prepaid plan Best prepaid phone plan at Verizon Specifications Amount of data: 15GB Cost: $35/month (after $10 autopay discount) Family cost (4 lines): $140/month Perks: Mobile hotspot; International texting; Talk, text and data in Canada and Mexico Today's Best Deals Shop Verizon Prepaid Plans Reasons to buy + Lots of data + Discounts for autopay + Includes some 5G access Reasons to avoid - No discounts for additional lines - Can't combine loyalty discounts with autopay discount\n\nVerizon\u2019s prepaid plans don\u2019t feature a lot in the way of perks, as is often the case when comparing prepaid vs. postpaid phone service. But Verizon's prepaid options do pack in data, especially the carrier\u2019s 15GB plan. Even better, it's easy to lower the cost of your plan right away, making this 15GB one of the best cheap cell phone plans we've found.\n\nVerizon\u2019s 15GB plan costs $45 a month, but enrolling in autopay now takes $10 off the monthly rate. A month after starting your service, your autopay discount kicks in, immediately dropping the cost of your Verizon prepaid plan.\n\nVerizon continues to offer loyalty discounts for sticking with the carrier for coverage \u2014 $5 off after three months and and another $5 after nine months \u2014 but you can't apply both the autopay and loyalty discounts. It's either one or the other, so the lowest your bill can go is $35.\n\nThe only other prepaid options at Verizon are a pair of unlimited plans. They cost $50/month and $60/month after $10 autopay discounts. While all prepaid plans have access to Verizon's nationwide 5G service, only the $60 Unlimited Data Plus gives prepaid customers access to super-fast Ultra Wideband 5G.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Verizon's prepaid plans Row 0 - Cell 0 Monthly price for one line (w/ autopay) Notes 15GB prepaid plan $35 Mobile hotspot comes from monthly data allotment; 5G coverage through slower nationwide network; no discount on multiple lines Unlimited prepaid plan $50 5GB of hotspot data; 5G coverage comes through slower nationwide network; discounts as you add lines Unlimited plus prepaid plan $60 50GB high speed data cap before speeds are throttled; 25GB of hotspot data; Ultra Wideband 5G access; discounts as you add lines\n\nThe best Verizon phone plan for families\n\n(Image credit: Verizon)\n\n3. Verizon Unlimited Welcome plan The best Verizon phone plan for families Specifications Amount of data: Unlimited Cost: $65/month (includes $10 autopay discount) Family cost (4 lines): $120/month Perks: 5G coverage Today's Best Deals Shop Verizon Unlimited Plans Reasons to buy + Verizon's most affordable unlimited data plan + Includes 5G coverage + Access to same $10 add-ons as Unlimited Plus Reasons to avoid - No hotspot data - Data speeds can be slowed when there's lots of traffic\n\nVerizon phone plans used to be extremely pricey, but the Unlimited Welcome plan lets you access the network's coverage for just $65/month for a single line of data. That's just $5 more than T-Mobile's equally bare-bones Essentials unlimited data plan.\n\nTo reiterate the trade-off for Unlimited Welcome's low price, there's no hotspot data as there is with the Unlimited Plus plan and Verizon can slow your speeds if its network gets congested. Still, if you need multiple lines, Unlimited Welcome is the best family cell phone plan at Verizon. Thanks to multiline discounts, four lines of data cost just $120/month. A current discount when you bring your own phone lets you drop the cost of each line by $5 per month, lowering the monthly total to $100. The ability to mix-and-match plans means that some lines in a family plan can have Unlimited Plus while others get Unlimited Welcome.\n\nThe same add-ons available for Unlimited Plus customers also work for Unlimited Welcome. So you could tack on the Disney bundle with Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus and pay $75 for a single line of data plus all three of those streaming services.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Verizon family plans Row 0 - Cell 0 Monthly cost per line (2 lines / total) Monthly cost per line (4 lines / total) Unlimited Welcome $55 / $110 $30 / $120 Unlimited Plus $70 / $140 $45 / $180 Unlimited Ultimate $80 / $160 $65 / $220\n\nVerizon unlimited phone plan add-ons\n\nUnlimited Plus, Unlimited Welcome and Unlimited Ultimate plans have access to 10 different add-ons, each of which cost $10/month. Through these add-ons, you can tack on extra benefits to your wireless plan. The end result is a benefit-packed offering that compares well to best cell phone plans out there, though the risk is that adding too many benefits can drive up the cost of your Verizon plan.\n\nVerizon would counter that the advantage to making these extra benefits into separate add-ons is that you only need to add the things that appeal to you. If you don't do any international traveling, for example, you can safely ignore the Travel Pass benefit. What's more, Verizon's $10 pricing reflects a savings from what you would pay for the benefit on its own \u2014 anywhere from $5 to $25 in savings each month depending on the add-on.\n\nDisney's bundle of Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus would normally cost you $21/month at the tiers included in Verizon's bundle, so you're saving $11 by getting it through Verizon. Similarly, a bundle that features the ad-supported tiers of Netflix and Max saves you a little less than $7 when you buy Verizon's monthly bundle.\n\nVerizon has dropped two add-ons \u2014 a monthly credit for +play and a Walmart+ membership \u2014 but added a new perk that offers access to Google's Gemini Advanced AI model. Here's the list of benefits available to customers with unlimited data plans at Verizon:\n\n100GB Mobile hotspot\n\nDisney Bundle (Hulu, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus)\n\nNetflix + Max (with ads)\n\nYouTube Premium\n\nApple One\n\nApple Music Family\n\nUnlimited cloud storage\n\n3 TravelPass Days\n\nGoogle One AI Premium bundle (Gemini Advanced, 2TB of storage)\n\n5G coverage at Verizon\n\n(Image credit: Verizon)\n\nVerizon launched its 5G network in 2019, but the real boost came with the 2022 launch of C-Band spectrum. That extended Verizon's fast Ultra Wideband network to more areas, with 200 million people now covered by C-Band speeds as of this writing. We tested Verizon's C-Band when it launched and came away impressed by Verizon's improved network.\n\nAs of this writing, Verizon says its high-speed 5G reaches 250 million people; it no longer shares figures on its slower nationwide 5G, though you'd image the service has a more extensive reach. RootMetrics named Verizon the best 5G network in its most recent report covering the first half of 2024. Verizon's 5G reach in rural areas pushes it head of T-Mobile, according to RootMetrics, which also lauded the speed and reliability of Verizon's service. A different network tracking firm, OpenSignal, rates T-Mobile as the better carrier in terms of overall experience, including 5G download speeds as of January 2025, though Verizon earns top marks in other 5G categories like video streaming, gaming and upload speeds.\n\nIf you live in an area that's covered by Verizon's 5G network and want to experience faster coverage, unlimited data is the best Verizon plan to get. In particular, you'll want to opt for the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plans, as they include access to Ultra Wideband 5G. Prepaid plans get the nationwide 5G coverage as well, with the Unlimited Plus prepaid service enjoying Ultra Wideband speeds where available.\n\nMany of the best 5G phones are available through Verizon including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the latest iPhone 16 models.. The recently launched Pixel 9 phones are at Verizon, too. Verizon also has some 5G exclusives like devices from TCL, though some phones like the new Motorola Razr Plus (2024) foldable aren't sold through the carrier.\n\nThe best Verizon phone deals can help you find the best prices on all sorts of handsets, 5G-capable models included.\n\nHow to choose the best Verizon plan\n\nFinding the best Verizon phone plan for your wireless needs involves choosing between unlimited data or turning to the tiered data options from Verizon's prepaid service.\n\nIf your smartphone usage involves a lot of streaming \u2014 be it movies or music \u2014 you're going to want to look at Verizon's two unlimited options. Should your data needs begin and end with browsing the internet, checking email and the occasional social media post, you can probably get away with a tiered prepaid data plan.\n\nIf possible, look at your monthly data usage on your current plan to see how much you're consuming on average \u2014 if it's 15GB or less, you can save money each month by going prepaid. Just be aware that you won\u2019t get as many perks with a prepaid as you would with one of Verizon\u2019s postpaid options. Our guide on figuring out how much cell phone data you need each month can help you determine what kind of plan is best for your phone usage.\n\nOther phone carriers on the Verizon network\n\nWhile getting service directly from Verizon ensures you get Verizon's top speeds and best plans, there are other carrier options if you want to use Verizon's network without paying so much for your service. MVNOs \u2014 short for mobile virtual network operators \u2014 piggy-back on other carriers' networks to provide lower-cost service. The trade-off is that the parent carrier prioritizes its own customers so you might see slower speeds.\n\nIn the case of Verizon MVNOs, several use Verizon's superior network for their own 5G coverage. The best isn't technically an MVNO, as Visible is owned and operated by Verizon. Notably, Visible's unlimited data plans start at $25 a month \u2014 more than half of what you'd pay for service at Verizon, while using the same network. Visible now lets you pay for a year of service in advance, which lowers your monthly rate.\n\nAnother Verizon-owned service, Total Wireless, has revamped its data plans, with unlimited data starting at $40/month. Total's appeal lies in the fact that its plans come with a five-year price guarantee to add some cost certainty to your monthly budget.\n\nXfinity Mobile also uses Verizon's network to offer phone service for Comcast customers who also get their internet service through the provider. Adding multiple lines lowers the cost of unlimited data plans to $30 per line with Xfinity Mobile, making it an attractive option for families. If you find Xfinity's pricing too high, Comcast also offers the Now Mobile service, where a line of unlimited data costs $25/month. Like Xfinity, Now uses Verizon's network for coverage.\n\nHow do Verizon plans compare to rival carriers? The best T-Mobile cell phone plans beat Verizon on price, with T-Mobile's bare-bones Essentials plan costing $60/month. Other T-Mobile plans pack in more perks as opposed to Verizon's approach with turning perks into $10 add-ons you can add and subtract at will. AT&T has a lower-priced plan than Verizon's entry-level unlimited data offering a $51/month Value Plus plan that used to be limited to just one line of data; you can add extra lines of Value Plus, though the per line discounts aren't that significant. Other best AT&T phone plans are pretty comparable to what Verizon charges for unlimited data. Here's a look at how my picks for the best plan at each of three major carriers compare.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Verizon Unlimited Plus T-Mobile Go5G AT&T Value Plus VL Cost per month, 1 line $80 $75 $51 Cost per month, 4 lines $180 ($45/line) $155 ($38.75/line; cost of third line waived) $124 ($31/line) High-speed data cap None 100GB Data can be slowed when network is busy Perks 5G Ultra Wideband coverage, 30GB hotspot data, half-off the cost of 1 connected device (smartwatch, tablet, etc.) Taxes and fees included; 15GB hotspot data, 6-months of Apple TV Plus, free Netflix with 2 or more lines, Unlimited text and up to 5GB of high-speed data in 11 countries, unlimited 256Kbps data in 215+ countries Unlimited talk, text and data in Canada and Mexico, free texting to 200+ countries",

In short, the impact is centered on connectivity.\n\nIn its 2024 Consumer Connections Report, researchers at the communication/tech company said this year\u2019s report \u201creflects our commitment to understanding and supporting the ways technology shapes our relationships, empowers our families and enriches our daily experiences. It explores the interplay between digital and physical shopping experiences, and the growing reliance on home connectivity as people use more and more smart home devices.\u201d\n\nSome of the top-line trends with families, Verizon said, is the increased use of Tumblr, Whisper and Snapchat as social media apps parents are most focused on. The report also found data usage to be growing, \u201cwith average monthly usage up 6 percent year-over-year per Verizon Home Internet household.\u201d The research also found the average Verizon internet household has 18 connected devices.\n\nVerizon products and services are also helping parents keep strong ties to their younger children via their Gizmo Watch, which Verizon said, introduces kids to wireless technology safely. The company said only parent-approved contacts can call or text a child\u2019s watch \u2014 and the device can\u2019t access any Internet content. Verizon said there were an average of 3.3 million calls to caregivers that were made monthly using the watch.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nLooking at shopping trends, Verizon said today\u2019s customer experience \u201chappens wherever the customer wants \u2014 online, in person, on the phone or all of the above. You could call it \u2018phygital.\u2019 We call it the new reality.\u201d\n\nUnderpinning that new reality is the increased use of mobile devices. Overall, Verizon found that 23 percent of customer purchases were done online in 2024, and most customers \u201cwho used in-store pickup initiated their order online,\u201d the report noted. \u201cThat\u2019s most but not all: 2024 saw a 5.5 percent increase over 2023 in customers who started the in-store pickup process with a phone call.\u201d\n\nThe report also looked at sports usage and preferences as well as holiday and holiday-related travel. Regarding the latter, the report found that total mobility usage across airports studied in the U.S. over the winter holiday season came in at 17.7 million GBs with 106.8 million calls being made and 273.2 million call minutes. The report also found that video accounted for about 28 percent of consumer data usage at the airports studied.",

            "content": "\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, Feb. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Getty Images, a preeminent global visual content creator and marketplace, in collaboration with Verizon and the National Disability Leadership Alliance (NDLA), invites photographers and videographers to reimagine how the disability community is represented in professional settings. This global creative grant offers $20,000 in funding to help talented creators rewrite the narrative, showcasing the disability community as active, thriving professionals, leaders, and innovators in the workplace.\n\nDespite growing awareness of diversity in visual media, the stories of people with disabilities in professional roles remain underrepresented. Too often, visuals portray the disability community in limited, domestic or familial contexts, leaving a gap showcasing the vital contributions people with disabilities bring to the workforce.\n\nResearch from Getty Images\u2019 VisualGPS underscores this need for change: finding that 2 out of 3 Americans believe that seeing people with a range of abilities and personal characteristics in media and advertising has a positive impact on understanding one another. Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 visuals feature people with disabilities in a healthcare setting rather than at home or at work. This grant challenges creators to break those stereotypes by celebrating the talent, determination, and leadership of people within the disability community.\n\nThe grant builds on the success of The Disability Collection, a partnership launched in 2018 between Getty Images, Verizon and, the National Disability Leadership Alliance. The collection has grown to include over 12,000 curated images and videos devoted to portraying disabled people more authentically, and accurately. This project seeks to unveil the extraordinary diversity within the disability community, spotlighting the myriad ways people exist and navigate their day-to-day lives.\n\n\u201cThe global workforce has evolved significantly, yet the stories of the disability community in professional roles remain underrepresented,\u201d said Dr. Rebecca Swift, Senior Vice President of Creative at Getty Images. \u201cThis grant is an opportunity for creators to challenge stereotypes and showcase the vital contributions, leadership, and innovation that people with disabilities bring to workplaces around the world.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the challenges faced by photographers worldwide as they look to break into the commercial industry, the Getty Images\u2019 Creative Grant seeks to discover and nurture creative talent while also alleviating some of the financial hurdles they face to capture authentic content. The additional monetary and promotional support from Verizon also ensures a greater reach to potentially interested photographers.\n\n\u201cAs a brand driven to power how you live, work, and play, Verizon is thrilled to continue our ongoing collaboration with Getty Images and the National Disability Leadership Alliance through this timely and exciting creative grant,\u201d said Zachary Bastian, Manager, Strategic Alliances, Verizon. \u201cSince the Disability Collection began, it has built a community of creatives, brands, and non-profit organizations. Navigating Work Life represents a great opportunity to dive deep into people with disabilities thriving in careers.\"\n\nAs one of the largest technology communications companies in the world, Verizon is committed to fostering an inclusive environment and to making our digital space accessible to all. Through efforts like the Valuable 500, Verizon\u2019s Disability Advisory Board, and the Forward for Good Disability Innovation Accelerator, Verizon invests in an accessible future.\n\nOpen to photographers and videographers globally, and supported by Verizon, Disability in Focus: Navigating Work Life is a one-time grant, awarding one recipient $10,000, one recipient $7,000 and one recipient $3,000, as determined by an esteemed panel of creative industry judges and disability activists. The grant seeks diverse perspectives, with photographers and videographers with living with a disability specifically encouraged to apply.\n\nShortlisted photography and video projects will be judged by an esteemed panel including:\n\nContent creators are encouraged to apply before March 7th, 2025, at which point the application period will close. Recipients of the creative grant will be announced during the week of April 28th, 2025.\n\nTo apply, photographers and videographers must submit and adhere to the following:\n\nLinks to existing portfolio of work online\n\nThe submission must include: a 200-500-word summary of the project proposal and an inspirational mood board\n\nA short essay that outlines the approach\n\nProposals must be in English\n\nSubmissions must be digital\n\n\n\nGrant recipients are invited to license their award-winning content through GettyImages.com, at a 100% royalty rate for imagery created within their proposed project. Entrants will also receive guidance and mentorship from one of Getty Images\u2019 award-winning Art Directors, as well as a feature on Getty Images\u2019 Creative Insights website, in addition to promotion across relevant social channels. Please note, this additional support is not a requirement of the Creative Grant and is at the discretion of each recipient.\n\nThe Getty Images Creative Grants are a core piece of the wider Getty Images Grants program, collectively aimed at supporting the world\u2019s photographic and photojournalism community. Since the inception of the program in 2004, the company has awarded in excess of US $2.6 million, furthering our commitment to the craft of photography and bringing attention to important stories that without funding, may otherwise remain unseen.\n\nTo apply, visit: https://grants.gettyimages.com/en/grants/disability-navigating-work\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nAlex Lazarou\n\nalex.lazarou@gettyimages.com\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ab21bf03-cf65-4944-99c1-badab5149fd6",

Students may wonder, what is their purpose and does it have something to do with the damage dealt by Hurricane Helene?\n\nThe installation of these towers was facilitated by New River Light and Power, who provide electricity to App State and the larger Boone area.\n\nMariana Greene, a representative from NRLP, wrote in an email that there are 32 total towers in Boone, with 13 of them being on and around App State\u2019s campus. The towers have been around for more than five months, and construction was planned longer than that.\n\n\u201cThis project was planned in 2023 for installation in 2024 in cooperation with Verizon and Blue Ridge Energy,\u201d Greene wrote in an email.\n\nGreene wrote that NRLP\u2019s role was to support the installation. They have no direct involvement with the cell coverage provided by the towers. That is the responsibility of Verizon and Blue Ridge Energy, who provides cell services to Western North Carolina.\n\n\u201cThe initiative aimed to improve cell coverage for Boone residents, municipalities, businesses, schools, students, faculty, and staff,\u201d wrote Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer of Blue Ridge Energy Jason Smith in an email.\n\nThe towers were installed over summer 2024, but after Hurricane Helene, their importance to the community has increased tenfold. According to Smith, the small cell sites were not brought online until after the storm.\n\n\u201cVerizon\u2019s coverage around Boone and ASU\u2019s campus improved significantly following the damage caused by Hurricane Helene,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cFrom what I understand, the coverage for Verizon users is now outstanding.\u201d\n\nSome Verizon users on campus are feeling the positive change. Evan Stauffer is a freshman electronic media and broadcasting student who has noticed some improvement.\n\n\u201cMy cell coverage is better but still spotty in some areas,\u201d Stauffer said.\n\nHe is feeling optimistic about the new towers and hopes his coverage gets even better. However, other students haven\u2019t seen any improvements yet.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t noticed any major changes in cell coverage, but I have good coverage here and everything loads pretty quickly for me,\u201d said Brianna Moreira, a freshman nursing major.\n\nShe also hopes the cell sites would improve things, but not at the expense of environmental damage.",

Davis and his brother used to build robots from kits as young kids. \u201cI was just so curious about, \u2018how does it move, how does it work?\u2019\u201d Davis says. \u201cHow does it know which way is left and right?\u201d\n\nBut Davis\u2019s enthusiasm for computer science truly blossomed after he attended Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers at Howard University in 2018 and University of the District of Columbia (UDC) in 2019, when he was a middle school student. Right away, Davis says, he was hooked by the program\u2019s curriculum \u2014 and his first chance to wear a virtual reality (VR) headset. \u201cI saw robots, I saw VR goggles, and I saw everyone having fun, everyone learning,\u201d he says.\n\nDavis had hands-on experience with emerging technologies combined with the opportunity to apply them in solving real-world problems. From developing medical wearables that transmit vital health information in emergencies, to creating practical solutions for addressing climate change, the students collaborated to tackle urgent global challenges\u2014an experience that profoundly shaped Davis\u2019s vision for his future. \u201cI had never really thought about solving real-world problems,\u201d Davis reflects. \u201cI was focused on building robots or creating machines, but I didn\u2019t fully grasp the bigger picture until I joined this program.\u201d\n\nThe Howard University program, run by Dr. Kofi LeNiles, combines the tech-based, hands-on learning of the Verizon Innovative Learning program with university-specific values, with an aim of not just teaching tech, but also creating bonds between the students. \u201cWhat makes this program at Howard unique is that we not only focus on the excellent STEM curriculum that Verizon provides, but we also focus on community,\u201d LeNiles explains.\n\nBy transforming competition into teamwork, the program teaches valuable lessons. \u201cMy biggest takeaway from the Verizon Innovative Learning program was how teamwork can solve issues,\u201d Davis explains. \u201cWe really got together and put our ideas together and\u2026 wrote it down and started brainstorming; we came up with some really good ideas.\u201d\n\nAs a graduating high school senior, Davis is already focused on potential possibilities for his future. \u201cMy interest in STEM got me thinking about solving problems\u2026 and I feel like it really contributed to my future interest, because everything I do is about solving a problem or fulfilling a need,\u201d he says. Davis has plenty to keep him busy: he is already an entrepreneur with his own clothing line and plans to go to college and pursue electrical contracting as a trade.\n\nVerizon Innovative Learning is a key part of the company\u2019s responsible business plan to help move the world forward for all. As part of the plan, Verizon has an ambitious goal of providing 10 million youth with digital skills training by 2030. Educators can access free lessons, professional development, and immersive learning experiences to help bring new ways of learning into the classroom by visiting Verizon Innovative Learning HQ.",

Every corner of modern life is reliant on tech and without it, sustainability would be an impossible goal.\n\nThe technology industry as a whole contributes to around 3% of global emissions, a similar footprint size to aviation. Data centres, servers and devices all need to be powered. E-waste containing toxic substances like lead and arsenic is making its way into oceans and soil.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of what AI does or where the world of devices moves, a safe assumption will be that going forward humans and machines will consume more and more data,\u201d says Subho Mukherjee, Vice President, Global Head of Sustainability at Nokia.\n\n\u201cOur main focus is how we can decouple energy consumption from the data growth curve.\u201d\n\nIn the modern world, environmental impact can be measured and tracked, value chains can be transparent and efficiency enhancements can be automated. Without technology, none of this would be possible. Businesses across all sectors are harnessing the powers of technology to become more sustainable.\n\nSubho says: \u201cI believe it's important for the technology sector to focus on ESG because of its enabling effect. Think about what AI can do for the energy sector. Think about what networks can do for the manufacturing sector.\n\n\u201cWe really need to focus on ESG to be able to multiply the \u2018handprint\u2019 of technology.\u201d\n\nIoT technologies and AI can make a big impact through predictive maintenance, for instance. By sifting through large amounts of data quickly and accurately, AI can spot subtle patterns that may be missed by the human eye and potentially prevent catastrophic failures without wasting resources through regular checks.\n\nFaith Taylor, Senior Vice President, Global Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability at Kyndryl, agrees: \u201cTechnology is an enabler to accelerate decarbonisation and get to your environmental goals. By leveraging technology, you can go faster and implement on a global basis.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, both the internet and the first mobile phone became available. Both of these inventions changed the world, and business, forever. More than 100 years earlier, the invention of the telephone enabled individuals to communicate quickly without travelling. In 2025, nearly everyone from grandmas to business partners can be on the other end of a video call in mere seconds.\n\n\u201cWe understand today that as a community, we're global. Technologically, we're basically one world. Because of that connection, we need to leverage ESG in technology,\u201d Faith says.\n\nESG isn\u2019t just good for people \u2014 it\u2019s also good for business. Companies with a strong focus on ESG often perform better financially.\n\nJames Gowen, Chief Sustainability Officer and Senior Vice President, Supply Chain and Sourcing at Verizon, explains: \u201cOur employees are looking to work for a company that has sustainability at its heart.\n\n\u201cSecondly, our customers are asking for ESG because they want to make sure that they're working with companies that have sustainability at the core of who they are.\n\n\u201cInvestors are looking to invest with companies that have a roadmap and clearly defined, auditable goals for sustainability which are so, so important.\n\n\u201cAnd then lastly, for society, sustainable business is good business and that's how we think about it.\u201d",

Verizon touts itself as the \u201cfirst U.S. wireless provider to offer an AI-powered perk,\u201d so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Google AI and other models find themselves in carriers\u2019 arms going forward.\n\nMore on Google:",

            "content": "AST SpaceMobile has revealed that a project it has been working on with leading US comms provider Verizon has been given a regulatory green light by the Federal Communications Commission (FSS) to test satellite to smartphone voice, full data and video applications across the US, covering locations traditionally struggling for mobile connectivity.\n\nIn April 2023, AST SpaceMobile and its partners completed what was claimed at the time to be the first-ever space-based voice call to an unmodified phone, followed by another landmark with the initial 4G download above 10 Mbps in June 2023, and then the first-ever 5G voice call in September 2023. Ultimately, the firm and its partners demonstrated over 20 Mbps download speeds to unmodified phones on a 5 MHz channel.\n\nIn May 2024, Verizon announced a strategic partnership with AST SpaceMobile, with a commitment of $100m to target 100% coverage of the continental US on premium 850 MHz spectrum, with two major US mobile operators to provide direct-to-cellular connectivity.\n\nThe $100m commitment includes $65m \u200bof\u200b commercial prepayments, $45m of which are subject to certain conditions, and $35m of convertible notes. Commenting at the time on what he believed the partnership could mean, AST SpaceMobile founder, chairman and CEO Abel Avellan said the collaboration could enhance cellular connectivity in the US, and essentially eliminate dead zones and empower remote areas of the country with space-based connectivity.\n\nThe FCC has granted AST Special Temporary Authority (STA) authorising beta service in the US, enabling AST SpaceMobile\u2019s first five commercial BlueBird satellites, currently operating in low Earth orbit to test satellite connections with Verizon smartphones. This will support voice, full data and video applications, and other native cellular capabilities, without the need of any specialised software, device support or update.\n\nTo date, Verizon uses nearly 300 satellite-based portable network assets to ensure connectivity where fibre cables are unavailable or compromised. These assets provide temporary network access for first responders and in areas with limited permanent infrastructure, or for linking cell sites to the broader network when fibre cables are compromised due to power outages or physical damage.\n\nSatellite connections also see use as backhaul for Verizon cell sites in remote areas (like forests and mountain tops) where traditional wired connections like fibre are not yet available.\n\nRead more about satellite communications Telstra to offer Starlink satellite-to-mobile services: Australia\u2019s leading comms provider collaborates with SpaceX on combining satellite and mobile technology to provide connectivity options across expansive landmass.\n\nSatellite rises up the agenda in enterprise plans: Research from global mobile industry trade body finds almost 45% of enterprises surveyed view satellites as extremely important to their digital transformation agenda.\n\nStarlink traffic continues to skyrocket: Connectivity cloud company\u2019s 2024 Year in Review shows rapid growth of SpaceX services and mobile connectivity.\n\nSateliot closes \u20ac30m financing with EIB for satellite IoT: Long-term lending institution of the European Union announces first venture debt operation with Spanish space company to aid internet of things connectivity.\n\nCompared with laying fibre, the operator said satellite connections can be set up quickly, particularly in areas with significant geographical or logistical barriers, regarding this as a useful service while fibre optics is being planned and deployed. This, it said, allows cell sites to be operational and provide service while waiting for the installation of a more robust and high-capacity connection.\n\nA week ago, in what it called an historic first, AST and comms provider Vodafone Group revealed they had completed the first-ever space-based video call using 4G/5G smartphones, over a satellite built to offer a full mobile broadband experience from an area in Wales with no terrestrial mobile coverage.",

            "content": "Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%) continued to post strong subscriber growth in the fourth quarter, helping lift the stock. However, the stock has nonetheless traded lower over the past year.\n\nWith an attractive forward dividend yield of about 6.7%, the question is whether now is a good time to buy the stock. Let's take a closer look at its most recent results to find out.\n\nWireless subscriber growth leads the way\n\nVerizon's wireless business continues to be its biggest contributor, with revenue rising 3.1% year over year to $20 billion. Impressively, it was the 18th straight quarter of sequential revenue growth. The company added 568,000 total postpaid net additions in the quarter, including 426,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net additions. It said Q4 had its biggest postpaid phone gross additions in five years.\n\nThe company's broadband segment also continues to perform well, with total net additions of 408,000. It ended the quarter with 12.3 million total broadband subscribers, a 15% increase compared to last year. It added 373,000 fixed wireless subscribers, and 51,000 net Fios subscribers.\n\nVerizon's prepaid business continues to be under pressure due to the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program, which helped subsidize internet services. It lost 66,000 customers in the quarter. Excluding Safelink, which catered to the program, it added 65,000 prepaid customers.\n\nVerizon Business revenue, meanwhile, slipped 1.5% to $7.5 billion. Business wireless revenue rose 3.4% to $3.5 billion, as the company added 283,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions. However, it continues to churn off business wireline subscribers.\n\nOverall wireless equipment revenue, meanwhile, edged up 0.6% to $7.5 billion.\n\nVerizon's total revenue was up 1.6% year over year to $35.7 billion, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) edged up from $1.08 a year ago to $1.10. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 1.7% to $11.9 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, Verizon forecasts full-year 2025 wireless revenue growth of between 2% and 2.8%. It expects adjusted EPS to grow by 0% to 3% and for adjusted EBITDA to grow between 2% and 3.5%. The company is projecting operating cash flow of between $35 billion and $37 billion after spending about half of that on capital expenditures (capex) to result in free cash flow between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\nThe company also introduced an artificial intelligence (AI) strategy called Verizon AI Connect, a suite of products designed for businesses to manage AI workloads at scale. It currently has partnerships with Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\n\nA well-covered dividend\n\nWith a high yield, one reason many investors are attracted to Verizon is its dividend. On that front, the dividend is well covered. In 2024, the company paid $11.2 billion in dividends, while it generated $19.8 billion in free cash flow. That's good for a nearly 1.8x coverage ratio, which gives the company plenty of room to continue to increase the payout.\n\nVerizon's balance sheet also remains in good shape with a leverage ratio on unsecured debt (net unsecured debt/trailing-12-month adjusted EBITDA) of 2.3.\n\nBased on Verizon's projection of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion in 2025 free cash flow, it should continue to be able to raise its dividend next year and beyond.\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nVerizon has done very well adding postpaid wireless and broadband subscribers over the past year, but its stock has been stuck in neutral. At the same time, the company is generating a ton of cash that allows it to pay its robust distribution, pursue growth opportunities, and pay down debt.\n\nLooking at valuation, Verizon trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.3 based on 2025 earnings estimates, which is below the nearly 11 times multiple of AT&T.\n\nHistorically, Verizon has traded at a premium to AT&T and the current wide valuation gap between the two in favor of AT&T does not seem justified in my view.\n\nThe two companies have been performing similarly, but AT&T's stock has greatly outperformed Verizon's. For its Q4, AT&T grew its total revenue by just 0.9%, while its adjusted EPS was flat.\n\nHowever, investors like that AT&T plans to buy back shares and finally raise its dividend after keeping it steady since cutting it in half in 2022 in conjunction with its WarnerMedia spin-off. That's good for AT&T investors, but the two companies are performing pretty similarly from an operational standpoint.\n\nAs such, I prefer Verizon and think it is currently the better buy.",

The deal commences with the iPhone 4 available for preorder by Verizon\u2019s 93 million customers.\n\nVerizon iPhone becomes instant hit\n\nExpanding iPhone availability beyond AT&T proved big news for Apple customers in the United States in 2011. According to research firm Gartner, Android smartphones had passed the iPhone in sales by that time. The previous October, Apple CEO Steve Jobs even made a rare conference call appearance to blast Android \u2014 describing Google\u2019s mobile platform as fragmented.\n\nTech observers viewed the Verizon deal as arriving at the perfect time. When preorders started on February 3, the Verizon iPhone became the fastest-selling debut in the wireless company\u2019s history. This happened despite the fact that preorders took place in the middle of the night. Plus, only existing Verizon customers could buy them.\n\n\u201cThis was an exciting day,\u201d said Dan Mead, president and chief executive officer for Verizon Wireless at the time. \u201cIn just our first two hours, we had already sold more phones than any first-day launch in our history. And, when you consider these initial orders were placed between the hours of 3 a.m. and 5 a.m., it is an incredible success story.

            "content": "Verizon's opening Galaxy S25 deal was already good, but it required a trade-in to get one of these exceptional new flagships for free. Today, however, the carrier has just waived that criteria completely.\n\nPresumedly for a limited time, you can now get a free Samsung Galaxy S25 alongside a new line on either an unlimited Plus or Ultimate plan \u2013 as well as a free Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Tab S9 FE as bonus gifts.\n\nThe great thing about this new deal, aside from the fact you don't need to trade, is that it's available on both the mid-tier Plus plan as well as the higher-end Ultimate plan. That means you don't need that annoying trade-in, but you can also skip over the super-pricey Ultimate plan in favor of the more budget-friendly Plus plan if you want to save some cash.\n\nVerizon Galaxy S25 deal\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25: free with a new unlimited line, plus free Galaxy Watch 7 and tablet at Verizon\n\nVerizon has just significantly upped its opening Galaxy S25 deals - now giving the device away for free alongside a new line on an unlimited Plus or Ultimate plan. Previously, you needed to trade in to get a free device so this is a much more accessible promotion - and you can also throw in a free Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Tab S9 FE as bonus gifts if you're willing to pay a bit extra ($15/mo) for their cellular lines.\n\nIf you want to save some cash on your plan, you can instead opt to get the Galaxy S25 for $5/mo alongside the carrier's basic unlimited Welcome plan. Depending on your use case, this could be handy if you're not covered by Verizon's super-speedy 5G Wideband network.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that the higher-end plans come with discounted accessory cellular lines so it's probably worth checking those out if you're planning on doubling up your phone with the smartwatch and tablet that are on offer here too.\n\nWant to see what else is available this week?

Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin tests out Verizon's satellite service in a new commercial.\n\nAs someone who is no stranger to comm dropouts on a planetary scale, Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin has teamed up with Verizon to help promote the company's satellite-based solution to cell service \"dead zones.\"\n\nThe now 95-year-old astronaut, who in 1969 became one of the first humans to step foot on the lunar surface, appears in a new Verizon ad alongside Paul Marcarelli, the original \"Can you hear me now?\" Test Man to ask, \"Can you text me now?\"\n\n\"Fifty-six years ago, I was one of the select few that made it into space and the first team to help America conquer the moon,\" said Aldrin in a statement released by Verizon. \"Back then, space was the great unknown, and now we've never been closer to it. I can't look up in the sky without seeing a satellite fly by. It's remarkable to see how far the human race \u2014 and technology \u2014 has come.\"\n\nIn the commercial, Aldrin is seen wearing a silver jacket adorned with the Apollo 11 mission patch while planting a Verizon \"satellite powered\" red and yellow flag at remote areas around Earth. At each stop, whether it be on the desert floor of a canyon, at the base of a snow-covered mountain or in an area of the wildness already marked as a \"dead zone,\" the retired U.S. Air Force General and Doctor of Astronautics uses his Verizon-issued Android smartphone to show that he can still send texts.\n\nRelated: Buzz Aldrin: The second man on the moon\n\nAldrin's last test is shown as looping out around the moon \u2014 past an American flag planted on its surface \u2014 to a satellite in Earth orbit. There, a spacesuited Marcarelli (sans helmet) receives Aldrin's message and reacts, \"That's my line.\"\n\n\"It's been 10 years since I last asked America 'Can you hear me now?' Back then dead zones were everywhere and it's safe to say today they are only in the most remote places like the dark [sic] side of the moon,\" said Marcarelli in Verizon's release, making the common mistake of describing the far side of the moon as the non-existent \"dark\" side. \"Satellite is for sure the next frontier.\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

According to the company, its U.S. network provides coverage to more than 99% of the places where people \"live, work and play,\" but its satellite service now covers the \"very few places\" throughout the country where customers cannot connect.\n\nFor the service to work, the phones \u2014 which include Google's Pixel 9 series and Samsung's Galaxy S25 \u2014 must be outdoors with a line of sight to the Viasat, Echostar or other satellites that are part of the Skylo satellite connectivity service. The service may not work in parts of Alaska.\n\nApollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin (at left) with Paul Marcarelli, Verizon's original Test Man, in an ad for Verizon's satellite services.

This approval enables the first five of AST's commercial BlueBird satellites, already operating in low Earth orbit, to test connections with Verizon smartphones supporting voice, full data and video applications, as well as other native cellular capabilities, without the need of any specialized software or device support or update.\n\n\"That's one giant leap for connectivity,\" says Aldrin in the commercial.\n\nAST SpaceMobile also has an agreement to provide space-based network services to AT&T and its customers. Similarly, T-Mobile partnered with SpaceX to use the Starlink broadband internet constellation and its direct-to-cell capabilities.\n\nBehind the scenes from the making of Verizon's satellite services commercial featuring Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

Among his past spots are ads filmed for IBM and YouTube TV in 2019; a commercial for Quaker Oats in 2016; and a 2015 promotion to visit Switzerland.\n\nIn 1987, Aldrin joined Mercury astronauts Scott Carpenter and Gordon Cooper to advertise the Commodore Amiga 500 home computer and in 1972, a year after he left NASA, Aldrin helped sell the Volkswagen (VW) Beetle, comparing its computer diagnostics system to the computer he used to fly to the moon.\n\nFollow collectSPACE.com on Facebook and on X at @collectSPACE.

            "content": "Robinhood has been focusing on organic growth by implementing strategies such as deposit matches and marketing initiatives, as well as investing in both its current operations and new ventures. Additionally, the company has been using mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to accelerate its business expansion.\n\nThough Robinhood experienced significant growth in its customer base during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people stayed home and invested in their government stimulus checks, years later, the platform has continued to attract even more customers, many of whom have become more knowledgeable and now expect advanced tools, which Robinhood has adapted to offer.\n\nAccording to analysts, Robinhood has significant growth potential, particularly if it can encourage customers who have opened accounts to invest larger sums of money on the platform. Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley highlighted that while 10% of US adults have a funded account with Robinhood, the company currently controls less than 0.3% of the $65 trillion in retail assets in the US As of June 2024, Robinhood has facilitated over $200 million in asset transfer and retirement account contribution matches for its customers. This initiative helped the company secure over $13 billion in net deposits during the second quarter, with assets under custody reaching a record $140 billion\u2014an increase of 57% from the previous year. Additionally, retirement assets more than doubled, nearing $9 billion.\n\nAs stock prices hit historic lows, younger investors flocked to platforms like Robinhood. Founded in 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood quickly became a fintech favorite. The app, which pioneered commission-free trading, amassed 13 million user accounts and gained significant brand recognition, surpassing legacy brokerages like Charles Schwab and Fidelity, as well as app-first competitors like Webull and Dough.\n\nThe start of 2020 marked a turning point for retail trading, driven by increased market volatility, stay-at-home orders, and commission-free trading across platforms, which led to a surge in activity and a rise in new traders. Many of these new traders, particularly in their 20s and 30s, found the stock market more accessible than ever, as high prices had previously kept them from participating. With sports events canceled, many turned to stock trading as a replacement for sports betting.\n\nWe recently published a list of Top 10 Best Dividend Stocks on Robinhood . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)) stands against other top best dividend stocks on Robinhood.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition to technological improvements, shifts in asset classes and market structure have also played a role in the emergence of new investment products. One of the most notable innovations in 2024 was the introduction of event contracts, especially those based on elections. In addition, many other brokerages, fintech firms, and financial institutions introduced a wide range of new products that reshaped how retail investors could manage their investments, all while generating profits. The shift began in January when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin (BTCUSD) exchange-traded funds. This decision enabled retail investors to gain cryptocurrency exposure through their brokerage accounts, eliminating the need to open digital wallets for direct crypto purchases.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we performed an extensive analysis of leading financial websites to identify 10 dividend stocks available on Robinhood. Our selection process was based on a consensus approach, where we considered only those stocks that consistently appeared across multiple sources during our research. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked according to hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(VZ) the Best Dividend Stock on Robinhood?\n\nA smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company. It has grabbed the attention of investors over the years because of its consistent innovation and strong cash position. In FY24, the company reported an operating cash flow of $37 billion and a free cash flow of $19.8 billion, reflecting growth from $18.7 billion in the previous year. Analysts are optimistic about the company\u2019s future, especially following its partnership with NVIDIA to create an AI-driven enterprise solution that supports efficient AI applications on its secure 5G private networks with private Mobile Edge Computing. In addition, the company is exploring other AI-driven initiatives, such as network slicing and satellite connectivity, to create new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive edge.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) recently reported its Q4 2024 earnings, posting revenue of $35.7 billion, reflecting a 1.6% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven by strong customer additions in both mobile wireless and internet services. In the mobile wireless segment, the company added 568,000 net postpaid phone subscribers, up from 449,000 in the same quarter last year. Revenue for this segment grew 3.1% year-over-year, reaching $20 billion, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nDue to its stable cash position, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was able to increase its payouts for 18 consecutive years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on Robinhood. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share. The stock\u2019s dividend yield on January 30 came in at 1.88%.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024, 57 hedge funds owned investments in Verizon Communications Inc.

Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall, VZ ranks 6th on our list of top best dividend stocks on Robinhood. While we acknowledge the potential for VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The debt relief campaign is part of Verizon\u2019s ongoing commitment to recovery following Hurricane Helene\u2019s sweeping devastation.\n\nHundreds of North Carolina families are currently learning that Verizon has cleared their medical, financial, and other debts of necessity. The debt relief was implemented by ForgiveCo, whose \u201crandom acts of kindness\u201d model purchases consumer debt in the affected areas, with no applications required, and notifies recipients through life-changing surprise letters, emails, and text messages.\n\nIn a press conference, at Verizon\u2019s South Asheville store, the organizations announced all applicable debt has been forgiven. No further action is required by the beneficiaries. This random act of kindness is in addition to Verizon\u2019s $400,000 donation to United Way of North Carolina immediately following the storm.\n\nLeigh Anne Lanier, Atlantic South Market President, Verizon Verizon believes in the power of connection, not only through our technology but through the bonds we build with the communities we serve. To the 6,500 individuals impacted by this initiative and the broader Western North Carolina community, we are with you. We will always stand by you, not just as a business, but as a partner and a neighbor.",

The official site currently offers an enhanced trade-in rebate of up to $900, plus up to $300 of store credit on the house.\n\nGranted, the majority of this credit is intended to be used as part of a free storage upgrade, but that's still a useful bonus. What's left of your credit is particularly handy for cheap accessories like earbuds or chargers.\n\nBoth AT&T and Verizon also offer exceptional preorder bonuses. Right now, AT&T's maximum trade-in rebate of up to $1,249 is impressive enough to get an entire Galaxy S25 Ultra for free. Whereas, a trade-in alongside an Ultimate plan at Verizon is enough to bag you a free S25 Plus, Galaxy Watch 7, and a Samsung tablet.\n\nFinally, I'd also recommend checking out Boost Mobile's Infinite Access for Samsung plan. While this particular promotion is likely to stick around after the initial preorder window, this deal offers a Galaxy S25 Plus and an unlimited plan for just $65/mo. That's without the trade-in criteria - and you're also entitled to a free upgrade when the next generation of Galaxy devices arrive down the line.\n\nEnding soon: Samsung's epic Galaxy S25 preorder deal\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: $900 instant trade-in credit and up to $300 credit at Samsung\n\nLooking for an unlocked device? This right here is your best option by far. The official Samsung Store is offering an excellent trade-in rebate of up to $900 and $300 of store credit on the house for both carrier and unlocked devices today. The trade-in here is superb and the $300 credit is also a significant bonus that can be used to pick up any number of cheap accessories at the Samsung Store. Overall, a superb opening deal and one that's even better than I anticipated.\n\nMore Galaxy S25 preorder deals\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: up to $1,000 off with a trade-in, plus free Galaxy Watch and tablet at Verizon\n\nVerizon has come out swinging for its initial batch of Galaxy S25 deals with several promotions that are a throwback to those we saw over Black Friday. The crux of it is this: you can currently get a trade-in rebate of up to $1,000 with the Plus or Ultra or up to $800 off the standard Galaxy S25 alongside a free Galaxy Watch 7 and a Samsung tablet. Note that you'll need a new line on an Ultimate Unlimited plan to be eligible here and those free accessories also require a cellular line each, so even if the devices are free themselves you'll still have to pay $15/mo extra if you claim both of them!\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: get up to $1,299 off with a trade-in, plus cheap watch and tablet at AT&T\n\nAT&T's opening Galaxy S25 deals offer a compelling combination of a decent trade-in rebate and the option to bundle in a Galaxy Watch 7 and Samsung tablet for just $0.99 per month each. As always, the trade-in rebate is the bulk of the deal here since its maximum saving of up to $1,299 is enough to cover the entire cost of every device in the range. Note, that you need a 36-month unlimited plan to be eligible for the saving, although I expect the trade-in eligibility criteria to be pretty generous.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series: free gift card worth up to $200 at Amazon\n\nAmazon's deal for the new Galaxy S25 series includes a free gift card worth up to $200. The card amount here is going to depend on which device you go for - naturally, the pricier devices have a better gift card attached. Overall, I'm not bowled over by this particular promotion but it could be a decent option if you're not set on trading in for a discount and aren't interested in the $300 store credit that Samsung is offering (see above).",

These tools enable the company to provide answers, offers, experiences, and products tailored to the customer's needs.\n\nThese AI tools help save Verizon time and money, improve retention rates, and increase sales. That's having a positive financial impact on the company.\n\nMoving to the next phase of its AI strategy\n\nVerizon believes it's only scratching the surface of its AI potential. The company believes it can become a key enabler of the technology by using its assets to connect the AI ecosystem. It sees two opportunities for its business to capitalize on the growing need for AI infrastructure:\n\nConnectivity : The company sees opportunities to use its long-haul and metro Verizon OneFiber assets to connect AI applications in cloud-based data centers to customers.\n\nEdge compute : Verizon owns data centers near end users that it can use to reduce the time it takes to transmit information in support of AI applications.\n\nVerizon estimates that the total addressable market for telco AI delivery will be more than $40 billion by 2030. The company believes it's in a strong position to capture a sizable percentage of this opportunity due to its industry-leading assets. Verizon OneFiber is in 71 cities, with close proximity to enterprises and data centers. It also has significant data center capacity to support edge computing.\n\nThe telecom company is launching Verizon AI Connect to leverage its assets to provide companies greater access to the infrastructure they need to support their AI ecosystem. Verizon is currently pursuing over $1 billion in business by leveraging its existing infrastructure.\n\nThe company has already formed partnerships with several AI leaders, including Nvidia, Alphabet's Google, and Meta Platforms. For example, it's working with semiconductor giant Nvidia on how to integrate GPU-based edge platforms into Verizon's private 5G networks. Meanwhile, it's collaborating with Google Cloud to advance AI solutions for network maintenance and anomaly detection. It has also expanded its existing partnership with Meta into network infrastructure.\n\nThe telecom giant is \"seeing significant demand for reliable network infrastructure that can support existing AI workloads,\" according to Verizon Business CEO Kyle Malady. The company can initially support this demand with its existing infrastructure, which will enhance its revenue and returns. This robust demand could also provide the company with new investment opportunities to expand its already industry-leading asset base and support the future infrastructure needs of technology companies and other customers.\n\nA potentially major enhancer\n\nVerizon sees tremendous potential for AI to enhance its business. It's already using the technology to improve customer experiences and increase efficiency. The telecom company sees an even bigger potential revenue opportunity in leveraging its telecom assets to provide the infrastructure needed to support the AI ecosystem. That could help the company accelerate its earnings growth, which, when added to its high-yielding dividend (6.7%), sets Verizon up to potentially produce robust total returns in the coming years.",

            "content": "Verizon Communications Stock Shows Signs Of Recovery Positive earnings and growing subscriber base boost investor confidence as the company navigates competitive pressures.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (VZ) has faced challenges over the past year, but recent results suggest potential for recovery and growth. The company, with a market capitalization of $166.2 billion, is recognized as one of the leading players in the communications sector, offering services from wireless to broadband and wireline solutions across two primary segments: the Verizon Consumer Group and the Verizon Business Group.\n\nDespite these strengths, Verizon's stock has underperformed compared to broader market indices. Over the past year, VZ shares have declined by 7.1%, starkly contrasting with the S&P 500 Index, which surged by 23.3%. Year-to-date, VZ is down 1.3%, lagging behind the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund's impressive 31.1% gain.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, Verizon reported its fourth-quarter earnings, which revealed some encouraging signs. The company posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.10 and revenue of $35.7 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Notably, Verizon saw substantial net additions of 1.41 million postpaid customers and 408,000 broadband additions, showcasing positive customer engagement.\n\nContributing to this turnaround was Verizon's net income of $5.1 billion, which marked a significant recovery from losses posted the previous year. The company benefited from pre-tax gains from special items, enhancing its overall financial health. \"The guidance for 2025, including expectations for wireless service revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA increases, has helped boosts investor confidence,\" explained financial analyst commentary surrounding the earnings report.\n\nVerizon's performance has made analysts optimistic about its outlook. Projections for the current fiscal year ending December 2025 forecast EPS growth of 2.2% year-over-year to $4.69. Analysts have also noted Verizon's consistent ability to exceed consensus earnings estimates over the last four quarters, which has contributed to its positive rating trend.\n\nAmong the 25 analysts covering VZ, the consensus rating is categorized as a \"Moderate Buy,\" with nine expressing strong buy sentiments, two moderate buys, and 14 holds. Notably, this distribution indicates increased confidence compared to previous months when there were only seven strong buy ratings.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, Evercore ISI raised its price target for VZ to $44, maintaining an \"Underperform\" rating. Their rationale stemmed from strong subscriber growth and optimistic financial predictions heading toward 2025. Despite this cautious stance, the firm's outlook remains more bullish compared to earlier assessments, signaling significant potential for growth.\n\nCurrently, VZ is trading below the analysts' collective mean price target of $46.49, with the highest target set at $55. This suggests potential upside of up to 39.3%, indicating room for significant recovery.\n\nMorningstar's evaluation of Verizon's fourth-quarter results indicates modest growth overall. They report wireless service revenue increased by 3.1% year-over-year. Though postpaid net additions slightly improved, the firm acknowledges continued challenges from rival carriers who are vigorously contesting market share.\n\nMorningstar's fair value estimate for Verizon is set at $53.00, reflecting their assessment of the company's market position. The firm rates Verizon with four stars, indicating their belief it is undervalued compared to its long-term fair value metrics. \"With Verizon trading more than 20% under our fair value estimate, the stock appears attractive compared to peers,\" noted Morningstar's analysts.\n\nDespite the optimism, Verizon does face competition-induced pressures. The company concedes to ceding significant market growth to rivals such as T-Mobile and AT&T, which have aggressively pursued customer acquisition. For example, postpaid phone net additions are projected to be less than competitive figures, as the analysts suggest rivals added over 2 million customers during the past period.\n\nThe favorable conditions for the U.S. wireless industry contribute to Verizon's comparatively strong position, with the company claiming over 90% of retail postpaid phone clientele alongside its major market competitors. Insights suggest steady revenue growth per postpaid customer is expected, driven primarily by pricing stability rather than exponential market expansion.\n\nDespite these competitive hurdles, Verizon has made strides with its operational approach. The recent growth figures are bolstered by effective pricing strategies, leading to revenue per consumer postpaid account casually improving by 4% year-over-year to $140.\n\nFurther accumulating evidence of Verizon's overall strengths is its financial footing. Although the company took on significant debt for strategic acquisitions\u2014more than $65 billion to purchase Vodafone's stake\u2014its management remains focused on reducing leverage and strengthening cash flows.\n\nVerizon is aware of potential regulatory and technological disruptions on the horizon. Recent concerns surrounding outdated lead-sheathed cables within telecom networks have raised eyebrows among analysts and regulators. If these cables are deemed hazardous, it could spark significant financial liabilities.\n\nThere is also the debate surrounding the sustainability of Verizon\u2019s network position. While optimists praise the extensive coverage and reliability of the Verizon wireless network, pessimists worry about the fast-evolving competition. \"The wireless technology revolution has made it increasingly affordable for rivals to expand their own infrastructures, leaving Verizon's prior market leadership vulnerable,\" explained analysts familiar with the sector.\n\nVerizon's stock performance moving forward hinges largely on its ability to maintain pricing structures and growth momentum against fierce market competition. The recent fourth-quarter results establish grounds for cautious optimism, yet the next year remains dynamic and uncertain for this telecommunications giant.",

            "content": "NEW YORK - Today, Verizon is pushing the boundaries of satellite and terrestrial telecommunications convergence. Satellites are no longer reserved for the extraordinary\u2014they are woven into the everyday, and are being used to help connect and power customers\u2019 lives.\n\nA lot has changed since 2014 when Verizon\u2019s famous test man roamed the country asking \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d Now he\u2019s back, and reaching the limits of space with the help of American icon and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. They\u2019re partnering to show how America\u2019s largest network just got better.\n\n\u201cFifty-six years ago I was one of the select few that made it into Space and the first team to help America conquer the moon,\u201d said Buzz Aldrin, General USAF, Doctor of Astronautics. \u201cBack then, Space was the great unknown, and now we\u2019ve never been closer to it. I can\u2019t look up in the sky without seeing a satellite fly by. It\u2019s remarkable to see how far the human race - and technology - has come.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years since I last asked America \u201cCan you hear me now?,\u201d said Paul Marcarelli, the Original Verizon Test Man. \u201cBack then dead zones were everywhere and it\u2019s safe to say today they are only in the most remote places like the dark side of the moon. Verizon\u2019s always been on a mission to give its customers the very best experience, anticipate their changing needs and drive innovation. Satellite is for sure the next frontier.\u201d\n\nFreedom to message anywhere with satellite-power.\n\nVerizon engineers are relentlessly focused on providing the most reliable network experience for customers. Verizon\u2019s network covers more than 99% of where people live, work and play, leaving very few places throughout the country where customers can\u2019t connect. With the addition of satellite back-up to Verizon\u2019s already robust network, Verizon is making the largest network even better.\n\nSatellites play a crucial role in making connectivity with Verizon even more reliable, enabling text messaging in the few areas where traditional terrestrial-based cellular networks might not reach. Here\u2019s how:\n\nCustomers with select devices have access to satellite messaging features to enhance connectivity in areas without cellular coverage, allowing customers to send an emergency SOS message and provide their location.\n\nVerizon is collaborating with Skylo to make satellite messaging features and location detection available for customers with select Android devices.\n\nAnd recently, AST SpaceMobile and Verizon announced a strategic partnership with a commitment of $100 million from Verizon, to provide direct-to-cellular AST SpaceMobile service when needed for Verizon customers. The combination of Verizon\u2019s highly reliable terrestrial mobile network, use of the multi-operator 850 Mhz band and AST\u2019s commercial satellite array in low Earth orbit, is planned to enable cellular consumers to stay connected wherever they are, anywhere in the continental United States.\n\nThis week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has granted AST Special Temporary Authority (STA) authorizing beta service in the United States. This approval enables AST SpaceMobile\u2019s first five commercial BlueBird satellites, operating in low Earth orbit today, to test satellite connections with Verizon smartphones supporting voice, full data and video applications, and other native cellular capabilities, without the need of any specialized software or device support or update.\n\nSatellites provide reliable service in emergency situations.\n\nVerizon utilizes nearly 300 satellite-based portable network assets to ensure connectivity where fiber cables are unavailable or compromised. These assets provide temporary network access for first responders and in areas with limited permanent infrastructure, or for linking cell sites to the broader network when fiber cables are compromised due to power outages or physical damage.\n\nSatellite connections speed up delivery of service to customers in remote areas.\n\nVerizon uses satellite connections as backhaul for cell sites in remote areas (like forests and mountain tops) where traditional wired connections like fiber are not yet available. Satellite connections can be set up quickly compared to laying fiber, particularly in areas with significant geographical or logistical barriers. This rapid deployment is a useful solution while fiber optics is being planned and deployed. This allows cell sites to be operational and provide service while waiting for the installation of a more robust and high-capacity connection.\n\n* \"Largest network\" based on total postpaid phone connections publicly reported by Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T during the third quarter of 2024.",

This year, however, the company opted out of the game because it was crazy in love with a different idea.\n\nRather than compete against the noise of Super Bowl 59 ads, Verizon is debuting its new campaign, which stars Buzz Aldrin alongside the return of its original \u201cTest Man,\u201d Paul Marcarelli, during the 67th Grammys on Sunday.\n\nOf course, the company isn\u2019t abandoning the Big Game entirely.\n\nIn addition to trying to create buzz with Buzz Aldrin, Verizon is marking Super Bowl 59 with a FanFest in all 30 NFL markets on Feb. 9. The company also recently unveiled its House of Verizon activation in New Orleans, running from Feb. 6 through 9, which will have a soundtrack by DJ Angie Vee and DJ Fannie Mae and appearances from NFL athletes, entertainers, and fashion industry luminaries, according to ADWEEK\u2019s Jason Notte.\n\n\u201cAdvertising in the Super Bowl is an incredible opportunity to reach large-scale audiences nationally. Verizon has done it in the past with great success, and we will continue to do so in the future,\u201d a Verizon spokesperson said in a statement to ADWEEK. \u201cOur goal this year, however, is to create something truly ambitious\u2014national in scope yet deeply rooted in local communities.\u201d\n\nCan you hear Verizon now?\n\nVerizon\u2019s new Grammys ad is a homecoming of sorts for the Test Man.\n\nMarcarelli\u2019s Test Man started appearing on Verizon campaigns more than two decades ago, briefly defecting to Sprint in 2016 after the company went in a different direction with its ads. Now, he\u2019s back to do a new twist on his classic catchphrase, \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d In the spot, Marcarelli and Aldrin tackle the problem of cellphone \u201cdead zones,\u201d with Verizon helping to conquer the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years since I last asked America, \u2018Can you hear me now,'\u201d Marcarelli said in a statement. \u201cBack then, dead zones were everywhere, and it\u2019s safe to say today they are only in the most remote places like the dark side of the moon.\u201d\n\nSee the linear debut of Verizon\u2019s Grammys ad on Sunday, Feb. 2, at 8 p.m. on CBS and Paramount+.\n\nAs for the Super Bowl, Beyonc\u00e9 was great. But this year\u2019s Big Game spots aren\u2019t Verizon\u2019s destiny, child.\n\nAGENCY CREDITS:\n\nCreative Agency: Gut\n\nDirector: Calmatic\n\nProduction Company: Pretty Bird\n\nMusic: Music & Strategy\n\nSound: Human Worldwide\n\nPost/VFX: JAMM\n\nPhotographer: Daniel Dorsa",

The famous space explorer takes to roaming the earth in an effort to test out the effectiveness of satellites that help boost Verizon\u2019s network. \u201cCan you text me now?\u201d asks Aldrin from different locations around the world. \u201cHey,\u201d says \u201cTest Man\u201d in space. \u201cThat\u2019s my line.\u201d\n\n\u201cTest Man\u201d became a marketing success for Verizon for years, but flunked out after Marcarelli defected and went to work for rival Sprint in 2016 after his original employer moved on to different promotional strategies. Big advertisers spend millions on developing characters for commercials, but Marcarelli wasn\u2019t some animated mascot, like the Green Giant or Pillsbury Doughboy, and the idea of paying him to not work for rivals may not have occurred to executives at the time. In the Sprint ad, Marcarelli said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m Paul and I used to ask if you could hear me now at Verizon. Not anymore.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe company paid homage to the character in June with a commercial that featured a different actor playing an engineer who utters the famous phrase, only to be followed by dozens of other consumers using Verizon to \u201cplay me now,\u201d \u201cstay with me now\u201d and \u201cmeet me now.\u201d The spot proved popular, according to a company spokeswoman, who notes \u201cthere were no hard feelings\u201d about Marcarelli\u2019s defection to a competitor.\n\nThe new spot aims to show how Verizon can defeat \u201cdead zones\u201d by using satellite connectivity to thwart conditions in remote areas where traditional fiber connections are not available. Based on (consumer) reception to the proposition, the commercial may also serve as a study of how to revive a popular Madison Avenue personality after a years-long absence.",

            "content": "All network operators now face the challenge of supplying services to enterprises, with unprecedented demand for network capacity and computational power driven by the uptake in adopting cloud services and particularly artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nResponding to this challenge, Verizon Business has unveiled an integrated suite of solutions and products designed to enable businesses to deploy AI workloads at scale.\n\nThe new Verizon AI Connect comprises a network infrastructure and suite of products designed to enable global enterprises to deploy AI workloads at scale. It brings together and \u201creimagines\u201d existing assets such as power, space and cooling across telco facilities; Verizon\u2019s One Fiber infrastructure; long-haul, metro and local fibre and optical networks; and the Verizon 5G Network offering functionality such as network slicing.\n\nPutting the launch into context and offering a business rationale, Verizon Business noted that training current advanced AI models already requires immense computing resources. It also cited a recent McKinsey study calculating 60-70% of AI workloads are expected to shift to real-time inference by 2030, creating an urgent need for the kind of low-latency connectivity compute and security at the edge beyond current demand and to build for the future.\n\nVerizon added that the demand for scalable infrastructure to support AI workloads has never been greater, and the work won\u2019t be possible without a strong network underpinning it. The company said it was already seeing a demand for this offering, with a $1bn pipeline and key cloud providers such as Google Cloud and Meta already signed on.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing significant demand for reliable network infrastructure that can support existing AI workloads,\u201d said Verizon Business CEO Kyle Malady. \u201cAs the technology evolves, our industry leadership, best-in-class edge-to-cloud connectivity, programmable networks and assets will enable us to meet these needs and accelerate innovation.\u201d\n\nIn building an ecosystem capable of meeting customer demands, Verizon emphasised the need for key partnerships and collaborations, naming partners such as NVIDIA, Vultr, Google Cloud and Meta. The partnership with global GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) and cloud computing provider Vultr is a new announcement, while Verizon recently announced its work with NVIDIA to reimagine how GPU-based edge platforms can be integrated into 5G private networks.\n\nVerizon has already collaborated with Google Cloud on advanced AI solutions for network maintenance and anomaly detection, and it has an existing strategic partnership with Meta across numerous products, technologies and business units. Verizon AI Connect will expand this partnership into network infrastructure in helping to build the AI ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to deliver critical infrastructure for our apps and technologies, we\u2019re strengthening our network with AI and the future in mind,\u201d said Gaya Nagarajan, vice-president of network infrastructure at Meta. \u201cThis means partnering with Verizon to build and operate networks that support our existing services, while accelerating more intelligent and predictive capabilities that will serve the people who use our products.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Kardwell, CEO of Vultr, added: \u201cGPUs play a crucial role in powering AI workloads, and rapidly growing demand for real-time inference is driving the need for AI infrastructure at the edge.\n\n\u201cWith demand for datacentres and GPU processing power outpacing supply, Verizon\u2019s connectivity infrastructure is uniquely positioned to support our growth. Through Verizon AI Connect, we can extend our global cloud footprint and bring cutting-edge AI solutions to Verizon Business\u2019 global customers.\u201d",

It is unclear if Meta and Google Cloud are users as well as partners and collaborators or the activities are synonymous.\n\nVerizon Business points to the shift of AI to real time decision making, which it says is known as inferencing.

This will drive a \u201cmassive\u201d demand for more computing power for low-latency connectivity, compute and security at the edge of the network.\n\nGoogle Cloud and Meta are among the first users of AI Connect.

            "content": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. Coast Guard has awarded Verizon Business an 8-year Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) task order worth up to $66 million over the life of the contract. Under this agreement, Verizon will provide Wi-Fi, phone, data, and other services to the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s C5I (Command, Control, Communication, Computer, Cyber, and Intelligence) office.\n\nVerizon will be partnering with the Coast Guard to phase out end-of-life TDM services, implementing solutions like a cellular-based POTS replacement for essential voice communications. This includes offering Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), delivering secure IL-4 (Impact Level 4) software-based solutions for Coast Guard call centers.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Coast Guard task order is yet another example of the strong relationship Verizon enjoys with a number of federal agencies, to include the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Veterans Affairs and more\u201d said Michael Adams, associate vice president for federal civilian services at Verizon. \u201cThe trust placed in Verizon by the federal government is indicative of the reliability and security of our enterprise solutions.\u201d\n\nWhile the base task order spans 12 months, it may extend up to an eight-year period of performance. Verizon will deliver EIS services, including internet protocol service (IPS), broadband internet service (BIS), internet protocol voice service (IPVS), toll-free service, managed network services, managed security services, contact center services, and related equipment.\n\nVerizon has earned the trust of the U.S. Armed Forces through a number of contract wins, including a 10-year, $2.67 billion multiple award contract with the U.S. Navy, a $1 billion DoD engagement to overhaul the Pentagon\u2019s network, and a $78 million digital modernization contract with Naval District Washington.\n\nFor more information on Verizon\u2019s work across the public sector, visit our website .\n\nVerizon Communications Inc.

            "content": "Is Verizon Fios or Xfinity better?\n\nVerizon Fios and Xfinity are well matched in the world of home internet, each playing to their strengths and offering unique services, but CNET picks Verizon Fios as the better provider overall, largely due to its 100% fiber network, straightforward pricing and promotional offers.\n\nWhile the two providers advertise comparable download speeds, Verizon Fios can deliver symmetrical (or close) upload speeds and superior reliability over a fiber-optic connection. Verizon Fios plans also come with free equipment, unlimited data, no contract requirements and much longer price guarantees than Xfinity. The stable pricing, favorable service terms, and the speed and reliability of a 100% fiber connection have helped Verizon Fios land J.D. Power\u2019s top spot for customer satisfaction in the East region for over a decade.\n\nXfinity is likely to offer more plan choices, including a few that are priced lower than the cheapest plan from Verizon Fios. You may also have a better selection of internet and TV bundles with Xfinity and a discount for each Xfinity service you add to the bundle.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nSo if you're looking for cheap, affordable internet, Xfinity might be a better option, but Verizon Fios will be the best all-around service for most. Here's everything you need to know to decide which provider, Verizon Fios or Xfinity, is best for your home.\n\nXfinity Lots of options but price jumps after promo period Our take - Xfinity gives you a total of 7 to 8 plan options which is more than just about any other provider, with speed tiers ranging from 150Mbps to 10Gbps. While availability on the 10Gbps plan is highly limited (with a hefty price tag of $300 per month), the standard gigabit plan is available in 99% of Xfinity's service areas. However, since Xfinity uses a cable connection, upload speeds on all plans under 10Gbps won't match the fast download speeds, so expect upload speeds in the 20 to 200Mbps range.

The speeds offered are 300Mbps, 500Mbps and 1- and 2-gigabit speed tiers. Since Verizon Fios employs a 100% fiber connection, customers can expect symmetrical or near-symmetrical upload and download speeds. Pricing is about the same as Xfinity for comparable speed tiers but without the definite and potentially steep price increase after a year or two of service. Read full review . . . Or call to learn more: (888) 439-8845 Check with Verizon Show more details Compare\n\nVerizon Fios vs. Xfinity: Plans and pricing\n\nBoth Verizon and Xfinity offer a variety of home internet plans, as well as bundles that package your home internet with other services like mobile or cable TV. You'll find a greater variety of options with Xfinity, which offers up to twice as many plans as Verizon Fios in most locations. Here\u2019s a look at those plans.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nComcast Xfinity internet plans (West region)\n\nPlan Monthly price Max speeds Fees and service details Connect $20 ($67 after 12 months) 150Mbps download, 20Mbps upload $15 gateway rental (optional), 1.2TB data cap, no contracts Connect More $35 ($79 after 12 months) 300Mbps download, 20Mbps upload $15 gateway rental (optional), 1.2TB data cap, no contracts Fast $55 ($89 after 12 months) 500Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included 12 months), 1.2TB data cap, no contracts Superfast $65 ($99 after 12 months) 800Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 12 months), 1.2TB data cap, no contracts Gigabit $65 ($109 after 12 months) 1,000Mbps download, 20Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 12 months), 1.2TB data cap, no contracts Gigabit Extra $85 ($119 after 12 months) 1,200Mbps download, 40Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 12 months), 1.2TB data cap, no contracts Gigabit X2 $80 ($116 after 12 months) 2,000Mbps download, 200Mbps upload Optional $15 gateway rental (included for 12 months), 1.2TB data cap, 1-year contract Gigabit Pro (fiber) $300 10,000Mbps download, 10,000Mbps upload $20 gateway rental (required), unlimited data, 2-year contract Show more (3 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nVerizon Fios home internet plans\n\nPlan Monthly price Max speeds Fees and service details Fios 300 $50 300Mbps download, 300Mbps upload Free equipment, no contracts or data caps Fios 500 $75 500Mbps download, 500Mbps upload Free equipment, no contracts or data caps Fios 1 Gig $90 940Mbps download, 880Mbps upload Free equipment, no contracts or data caps Fios 2 Gig $110 2,300Mbps download, 1,500Mbps upload Free equipment, no contracts or data caps Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nFewer hassles and fees with Verizon Fios\n\nRegardless of your location or the plan you choose, all Verizon Fios plans come with free equipment rental, unlimited data and no contract requirements. In addition, Verizon Fios has a limited-time offer, locking your price for up to five years for all plans. Prior this offer, the 300Mbps plan, for example, used to come with a two-year price guarantee, whereas the gigabit plans could include a four-year price guarantee when you sign up. For eligible addresses, customers can earn a $100 gift card when they sign up online.\n\nXfinity\u2019s service terms and conditions are a bit less straightforward. Depending on where you live and the plan you choose, Xfinity internet service may or may not include your equipment rental and/or unlimited data. Furthermore, a one or two-year contract may be required to get the lowest pricing. In most markets, the $15 equipment fee is optional unless you choose to rent. Customers can also expect a data cap (1.25TB per month) and additional fees once they've reached that threshold.\n\nBoth providers offer discounted rates for low-income households\n\nWith Verizon, the Fios Forward program lets qualified customers deduct $20 from the monthly cost of any Verizon Fios plan. That brings the cost of a 300Mbps fiber internet plan down to $30 per month and a 940Mbps plan down to $70 monthly.\n\nWith Comcast, customers who participate in the National School Lunch Program, Medicaid, SNAP and other federal programs can sign up for the Internet Essentials plan, which offers speeds of 75Mbps for $15 per month. Xfinity also features an Internet Essentials Plus plan, which doubles the download speed to 100Mbps for $30 a month.\n\nXfinity vs. Verizon Fios: Availability and connection types\n\nEnlarge Image Verizon Fios coverage is concentrated in the Northeast, while Xfinity service is more widespread and available in several regions. FCC/Mapbox\n\nXfinity is the nation\u2019s largest cable internet provider, available to more than a third of US households coast to coast, according to the FCC. Availability is somewhat random and limited to urban areas in states where Xfinity offers service. In Texas, for example, you won\u2019t find Xfinity much outside the greater Houston area.\n\nVerizon Fios has a more concentrated coverage area, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Service is available in metro and suburban areas from Virginia to Massachusetts and Upstate New York.\n\nMajor markets where Xfinity and Verizon Fios overlap\n\nWhy the connection type matters\n\nXfinity's fiber presence is very limited at present, offering less than 1% of unit coverage, according to the latest FCC data. That said, Xfinity's internet service specializes in cable internet, which carries your web traffic along the same copper coaxial wiring that delivers cable TV into people's homes. That's no surprise: along with being an internet juggernaut, Comcast is one of the biggest cable TV providers in the US.\n\nCable internet doesn't have the same speed potential as fiber internet, especially regarding upload speeds, but it's still quite capable of delivering a quality high-speed connection. Xfinity offers max download speeds of 1,200 or 2,000Mbps in most locations, with accompanying max upload speeds of 40 to 200Mbps.\n\nSuch speeds are faster than you\u2019ll find from most cable internet providers, but they still fall short of Verizon Fios. The fiber internet provider offers symmetrical speeds (upload and download) of up to 2,300Mbps in select locations. In areas where the 2,300Mbps plan is unavailable, Verizon Fios advertises max speeds of 940Mbps down and 880Mbps up. While the download speeds are slightly slower than Xfinity\u2019s max speeds, the faster upload speeds and reliability of a 100% fiber-optic connection make Verizon Fios the better choice for gig service.\n\nHow much internet speed do I really need?\n\nGeneral internet activities, such as streaming TV or gaming online, require slower speeds than you might think. Streaming in HD or 4K, for example, typically requires download speeds around 50Mbps, while online gaming is possible with 10Mbps or less.\n\nSo Xfinity's cheap 150Mbps plan should handle all your needs, right? Not exactly. A plan's advertised speeds are rarely those you will see inside the home to a connected device such as a streaming stick or gaming console.\n\nUsing a Wi-Fi connection and connecting multiple devices to your network -- smart TVs, laptops, phones, consoles, security cameras and smart speakers add up quickly -- can slow your speeds. Therefore it\u2019s best to choose a plan with ample speed for all your devices. If you plan to stream TV on multiple screens at once, speeds of at least 200Mbps are recommended. For heavier internet activity and households with multiple users, faster speeds will provide a better experience. Read more about how you can boost your speeds at home.\n\nVerizon Fios boasts higher customer satisfaction ratings\n\nACSI\n\nSomething else worth considering if you're comparing Xfinity and Verizon Fios is how happy their existing customers are with the services. The American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power track this metric with yearly surveys and reports, including a regular look at the top telecom providers.\n\nVerizon\u2019s ACSI score increased in 2024 from 75/100 to 77, topping other fiber providers like Quantum Fiber, Google Fiber and Frontier Fiber. In addition, Verizon Fios fared better than Xfinity\u2019s fiber service (75) and cable service (67).\n\nJ.D. Power ranked Verizon Fios as the top provider for customer satisfaction in the East region in 2024, with a score of 575/1,000. Xfinity came in at 532 in that same region, below fellow cable provider Cox (526) and the regional average (528). However, Xfinity scored above the region averages in the three other areas J.D. Power covers.\n\nThe bottom line: Go with Verizon Fios\n\nXfinity has greater availability, wider plan selections than Verizon Fios and potentially lower introductory pricing, but Verizon Fios presents the best value. Though priced slightly higher than Xfinity on comparable speeds, Verizon Fios offers symmetrical upload and download speeds, unlimited data, free equipment rental and no contracts -- perks that aren\u2019t all available from Xfinity. Verizon Fios also has a better customer satisfaction record than Xfinity, though both ISPs typically score above the industry average.\n\nVerizon Fios vs. Xfinity FAQs\n\nWhat are the main differences between Xfinity and Verizon Fios? Speeds, pricing and service terms separate Xfinity and Verizon Fios. Whereas Xfinity primarily uses a cable internet network with limited speed potential, Verizon Fios employs a 100% fiber-optic network that can deliver significantly faster upload speeds and better speeds reliability. As for pricing and service terms, Xfinity typically has lower introductory rates, though service may come with equipment fees, data caps and a contract. Verizon Fios is contract-free and includes equipment rental and unlimited data at no extra cost.\n\nIs Xfinity or Verizon Fios cheaper? In most locations, Xfinity internet service costs $20 to $30 a month for max download speeds of 150 or 200Mbps. That\u2019s significantly less than the cheapest plan from Verizon Fios, which starts at $50 per month (though with faster and symmetrical speeds, up to 300Mbps). Other Xfinity plans are priced lower than comparative plans from Verizon Fios. Gig service from Xfinity starts at $65 monthly in many locations, whereas similar download speeds from Verizon Fios start at $90. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that renting equipment from Xfinity may add $15 to your monthly bill. So if you choose to lease equipment, you're looking at $35 to $45 to get started, which is still cheaper than Verizon Fios. However, Xfinity introductory rates expire after one to two years, after which your rate may increase by as much as $30 or more, depending on your chosen plan. Unlike Xfinity, Verizon Fios has no set price increases and boasts a price guarantee of up to five years.\n\nIs cable internet better than fiber internet? Fiber-optic internet, like that of Verizon Fios, is almost always preferable to cable internet services such as Xfinity. Max download and upload speeds are typically faster with fiber internet than cable. Verizon Fios has symmetrical max speeds of 2,300Mbps. Xfinity, one of the faster cable internet providers, offers max speeds of 2,000Mbps down and 200Mbps up in select areas. To dig deeper, check out CNET's cable vs. fiber internet service review.",

            "content": "Verizon-owned Visible offers unlimited LTE smartphone data starting at $25 a month \u2014 a bargain price compared to other phone carriers. With service on Verizon towers, this is a great choice if you're looking to cut down your monthly wireless bill.\n\nWhy you can trust Tom's Guide Our writers and editors spend hours analyzing and reviewing products, services, and apps to help find what's best for you. Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.\n\nWhy pay $65 to $90 a month for unlimited data when you need only part with as little as $25 to get that same big bucket of data on the same cellular network? That's the argument that Visible makes.\n\nOwned by Verizon, Visible uses its parent company's cellular towers to deliver the same extensive reach without the same pricey monthly bill. The service won't be for people who like having a brick-and-mortar store to turn to for support, but Visible does compare well other low-cost services that dispense with the frills to just provide lots of data for a little bit of dough.\n\nVisible has evolved a lot since its 2018, with some of the more onerous restrictions like speed caps on data long since eliminated. While expanding into new areas like 5G coverage and \u2014 in the case of its pricier plan \u2014 international calling, Visible has kept prices low to remain a compelling alternative to traditional phone service.\n\nWhen we tested the service a few years ago for our Visible review, we found a phone carrier that delivers lots of data for a relatively low cost. That's continued in the ensuing years, as Visible has improved its service since our original testing. We've updated this review to reflect the carrier's latest pricing and features, but as we first observed in our initial round of tests, Visible is a great option for bargain hunters who don't mind making a few compromises if it means a lower bill at the end of the month.\n\nVisible review: What the phone service costs\n\nWhen it first got started, Visible offered just one plan \u2014 a $40/month unlimited offer with taxes and fees included. Seven years later, you now have two options \u2014 both offering unlimited data with talk and text as part of the package. And yes, the price still includes taxes and fees so your bill will remain unchanged from month to month.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nThese days, Visible plans start at $25 for a bare-bones unlimited data plan. Your only perks with that plan include unlimited mobile hotspot data along with unlimited talk and text to Canada and Mexico. This is one of the best cheap phone plans for unlimited data on price alone, as it beats the $30 monthly plan that Mint Mobile offers. And Mint's price only gets that low if you pay for a year of service in advance \u2014 Visible lets you go to month-to-month with coverage. (That said, Visible does have an annual payment option that lowers the monthly rate on both its plans.)\n\nVisible's other option ranks at the top of the best unlimited data plans. It's $45 a month, and this Visible Plus plan includes data roaming in Canada and Mexico, plus international calling to 30-plus countries and texting to 200-plus countries. You're also eligible for a $10 monthly discount on Verizon's home internet service and smartwatch service is included for free if you're using one of the best Apple Watches. Most importantly, Visible Plus grants you access to Verizon's faster Ultra Wideband 5G service where available.\n\nVisible Plus customers also enjoy faster hotspot speeds compared to the cheaper unlimited option, and they get a Global Pass for use when traveling overseas that lets them use their plan at no additional cost. Sadly, Global Passes don't roll over to the next month, so you can't stockpile them for a big overseas trip the way you can with TravelPasses at Verizon.\n\nRecommend Visible to a friend, and you can knock $20 off next month's bill. Visible promo codes also offer you a way to save, and the best Visible deals provide discounts on new phones available through the carrier. Visible also runs frequent promotions to lure in new customers so if you're considering switching phone carriers, check to see if there any discounted rates available at Visible.\n\nVisible offers subscribers a Connection Protection program where the carrier will provide three months of subsidized wireless service if you lose your job. To qualify, you'll need to apply with the carrier for the program.\n\nVisible review: How prices compare to other carriers\n\nEven at $45, Visible Plus represents an insanely good price for unlimited data, especially when compared to what Verizon charges. Verizon's cheapest unlimited option \u2014 Unlimited Welcome \u2014 costs $65 a month, and it comes with few perks. To get Ultra Wideband 5G speeds, you'd need to upgrade to Unlimited Plus at Verizon, which starts at $80 for a single line.\n\nIn other words, you're saving anywhere from $20 and $55 a month by turning to Visible, depending on which of its two plans you pick.\n\nEven the $45 monthly plan is an insanely good price for unlimited data.\n\nVisible's pricing is also generous compared to that of other low-cost carriers. Besides Mint's $30 unlimited plan, you can turn to options like Metro by T-Mobile, where unlimited Metro Flex plans start at $50/month, or Google Fi, which charges $50 for its Simply Unlimited option.\n\nAbout the only carriers that match Visible's price on unlimited data are Tello and Boost Mobile, both of which charge $25 for their unlimited plans. Tello relies on T-Mobile's network for its coverage, while Boost has built out its own network, including 5G service. Boost also guarantees the rate on its $25 unlimited data plan for as long as you remain an active customer.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nAs noted above, Visible has followed the lead of Mint by letting your pay annually for your phone service to get a discounted monthly rate. Paying for a year in advance at Visible saves you $25 annually on the standard plan; Visible Plus customers save a total of $145 over the month-to-month rate with a $395 upfront payment.\n\nVisible review: Restrictions and limitations\n\nVisible does feature some other restrictions you should be aware of. (What \u2014 you didn't think there was a catch to that low monthly rate?) Visible reserves the right to slow down your data speed when Verizon's network is congested. (The Visible Plus plan does guarantee 50GB of \"premium data\" that won't be slowed.) Like Verizon's least expensive unlimited plan, Visible caps video streaming at 480p resolution.\n\nVisible used to let you bundle multiple lines into one plan for a discounted rate, similar to the best family cell phone plans at other carriers. But that program no longer exists \u2014 if you have multiple people in your household, they'll all pay the same rate, so families should look elsewhere for coverage.\n\nVisible review: Supported phones\n\nWhen Visible first launched, it was an iPhone-only affair \u2014 and you had to bring your own iPhone at that. Since then, Visible has since added support for Android phones, with the mix of models constantly changing.\n\nYou'll usually find the latest flagships from Samsung, Google and Motorola alongside the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15. As with other discount carriers, there's sometimes a gap between the launch of a phone, and when it goes on sale at Visible. For example, we're updating this review right after Samsung has announced the Galaxy S25 lineup, but the most current Samsung S model available at Visible is last year's S24 series. Expect that to change after February 7 when retail sales of the Galaxy S25 models begin.\n\nIt's not just flagships available at Visible. You can also find lower-cost models like the Galaxy A15, Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) and the TCL 50 XE \u2014 handsets that all cost $260 or less.\n\nVisible's phone inventory is pretty volatile in our experience, with devices frequently coming in and out of stock. So if you see the phone you want at a decent price, we'd suggest grabbing it.\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nShould you still want to bring your own phone, you can confirm that your iPhone or Android device works by entering its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number into the compatibility checker on Visible's website.\n\nVisible lets you keep your phone number when you sign up for the company's service (though you'll need to have some information handy from your previous phone service provider). You can also opt for a new number if you prefer.\n\nVisible review: Performance\n\nIt's been a while since we've tested Visible's service, though we wouldn't expect much has changed over the last couple years in terms of network performance. If anything, Visible has likely reaped the benefits of improvements to Verizon's network. Testing firm Rootmetrics' most recent report covering the first half of 2024 ranks Verizon as the best network overall and also praises the carrier's speed and reliability for 5G in a supplemental report. It should be noted that more recent reports from Opensignal and Ookla favor T-Mobile.\n\nWhen we first tested Visible, the service limited its data speeds to 5 Mbps. At that time, we recorded a top download speed of 5.89 Mbps at the University of California, Berkeley, campus. For comparison, an original iPhone SE tied to Verizon posted a 16.4-Mbps download speed at that same location at the same time.\n\nThat was characteristic of our first round of testing using Visible's service. Download speeds would occasionally poke above 5 Mbps \u2014 I saw a 6.11 Mbps download speed when traveling in Maui \u2014 but never by much and certainly nowhere near the speeds I could get through Verizon's standard service.\n\nThe performance gap didn't close even in areas where Verizon's network isn't as strong as elsewhere. At Berkeley's California Memorial Stadium, the iPhone SE I carried at the time would struggle with simple tasks like checking Twitter on game days when the stands are packed with tens of thousands of smartphone-toting fans. (Things haven't much improved since I upgraded to an iPhone 12.) I recorded a speed of 1.98 Mbps on my Verizon-tied iPhone SE during the 2018 Cal-Stanford game; at that same game, the Visible-powered iPhone 8 petered out at 0.19 Mbps.\n\nIn June 2019, however, Visible improved its service in a big way by removing the speed cap for both existing and new customers. We went back and tested Visible's performance again when the cap disappeared, and speeds were much, much better than anything customers saw previously. In our office in New York City, near Bryant Park, we pulled down 47.5 Mbps in Ookla's Speedtest app. In Southampton, PA, we recorded a top speed of 105 Mbps.\n\nHowever, Visible's unfettered speeds aren't quite as consistently high as you'd hope. Even though the network has ditched that pesky speed cap, Visible users are still subject to deprioritization during times of congestion. And, as we found in a string of head-to-head tests between a Visible-powered iPhone XS and a OnePlus 6T on Verizon, that often resulted in throttling for those who access Big Red's network through the discount prepaid network.\n\nOur Verizon-connected OnePlus 6T averaged 112 Mbps downloads across five tests in Pennsylvania. How did the Visible iPhone fare, in the same location at the same times? Just 37.5 Mbps.\n\nWe should point out that deprioritization is a common practice among big carriers and not unique to the Verizon-Visible relationship. But the occasionally slowed speeds are a trade-off you make for the lower monthly rate.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nBesides, we've seen instances where Visible's service rivaled Verizon's, like in one particular test where the prepaid carrier mustered an 82 Mbps-download to Verizon's 83 Mbps. But those occasions were few and far between, and Visible normally hovered at speeds either half or two-thirds as fast as those we'd see on Verizon.\n\nDisappointing though that may be, it doesn't necessarily mean that Visible's service is significantly inferior in a practical sense. For instance, it took me 56 seconds to download the Discord app on Visible's network, and that was when the 5 Mbps cap was in place. My iPhone SE took just 39 seconds through Verizon. That said, when I played PUBG Mobile over Visible's network, there were no noticeable lags or graphic slowdowns during this demanding game. When I died \u2014 and I did, often \u2014 it was due to my own lack of skill and not any throttling imposed on me by Visible.\n\nI also failed to notice much of a difference in video-streaming quality on Visible's network. Sure, my stream of Blue Planet II on Netflix was limited to 480p \u2014 wireless providers call this \"DVD quality\" \u2014 but the video looked good enough to my eyes most of the time. I could make out different shades of ocean blue and spot distinct fronds of gorgonian corals. Only occasionally did the picture look less than sharp, usually right at the start of a streaming session. I could also stream music from the Spotify app over LTE with no noticeable dip in quality.\n\nVisible review: What about 5G?\n\nVisible's parent company, Verizon, has been aggressively expanding its 5G coverage, launching nationwide service in 2020 to complement the high-speed 5G already available in major cities. Verizon has since rolled out C-Band 5G, boosting its speeds.\n\nVisible customers are reaping the rewards of those efforts, as they get 5G coverage through Verizon's network. Just make sure you have one of the best 5G phones.\n\nVisible review: Customer service\n\nYour primary interaction with Visible will be through the carrier's app on your smartphone. That's where you'll pay your bill, manage your account and deal with customer service questions. For that reason, you have to keep the Visible app installed on your phone.\n\nWhen I used the app for my original Visible review, I found it spartan but easy to navigate; I didn't like that it required me to log in if I hadn't used the app in a few days. Fortunately, iOS updates have long since added secure password saving features, so signing back in shouldn't be a hassle for most users.\n\nThe best feature on Visible's app is live chat with customer support, which is now available 24 hours a day seven days a week, according to Visible. When I tested customer support, I found the chat feature responsive to my questions, though at times, the chat will label itself as busy when there's a backlog of Visible users seeking answers.\n\nI was less impressed by an FAQ feature on the mobile app, which never seemed to load for me; instead, I had better luck perusing the FAQ on Visible's website, where you can also pay your bill. In a nod to younger users, the site lets you use Venmo or PayPal, in addition to a credit card, to pay your monthly bill.\n\nVisible review: Who should use this service?\n\nAs attractively priced as Visible's unlimited plan is, it's not a good value if you don't use a lot of data in a given month. If you use 5GB of data or less regularly, you're probably better off turning elsewhere, because plenty of MVNOs offer attractively priced tiered-data plans as you can see in our look at the best prepaid phone plans. A 5GB plan at Mint costs you $15 each month; T-Mobile also offers 5GB for that same amount. Even Verizon's own 15GB prepaid plan drops to $35/month after you enroll in autopay.\n\nVisible's service is best for users who consume a lot of data in a given month, by posting on social networks, streaming media and playing games. Users counting on fast data speeds may bristle at Verizon occasionally slowing Visible traffic, though I imagine the low monthly rate more than makes up for that.\n\nBecause Visible uses Verizon's network, you'll want to use the service only if Verizon's signal is strong where you live. Fortunately, Verizon's expansive network is far-reaching, but if you live in one of the areas Big Red can't quite reach, you'll be better off considering another carrier.\n\nVisible review: Verdict\n\nVisible's an intriguing wireless option if you've got a taste for lots of data but you lack the budget for a higher-priced unlimited plan. Visible provides you with all the data you could want for a reasonable $25 to $45 monthly fee, and though you'll have to make trade-offs, they won't hamper your phone usage very much. 5G coverage via Verizon's network makes Visible even more compelling.\n\nFor anyone living in an area that's well-served by Verizon's extensive LTE network and growing 5G coverage, Visible's a great way to save money on your monthly cellular service. Smartphone users who are outside of Verizon's reach and who prefer phones not currently supported by Visible's service will want to look elsewhere for their wireless needs.",

OpenAI and partners announced a planned $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure while Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is claiming to have spent $6 million on training an LLM with comparable capabilities to OpenAI\u2019s latest. Ensuing tech sell-off aside, communications service providers (CSPs) have been looking to capitalize on the AI investment supercycle we\u2019re in; we\u2019ve seen some early moves on GPUaaS but Verizon, which has long been touting the importance of edge computing, seems to have a fairly ambitious and comprehensive plan in AI Connect.\n\nTo restate the obvious, large centralized cloud computing facilities, like the ones Stargate is building, are used to train LLMs and, in some cases, conduct inference where ChatGPT answers your question, for instance. But there\u2019s increasing interest in edge AI for inference for a number of reasons but, primarily, because it reduces latency, potentially improves data privacy, and is much more cost efficient than transporting data to and from those centralized clouds.

In its announcement, Verizon highlighted McKinsey estimates that by 2030 60% to 70% of AI workloads will be \u201creal-time inference\u2026creating an urgent need for low-latency connectivity, compute and security at the edge beyond current demand.\u201d Throughout its network, Verizon has fiber, compute, space, power and cooling that can support edge AI; Google Cloud and Meta are already using some of Verizon\u2019s capacity, the company said.\n\nVerizon also gave a brief update on its AI-related \u201cpartnerships and collaborations,\u201d including with NVIDIA, Google and Meta as mentioned, and Vultr, a GPUaaS and cloud computing provider.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing significant demand for reliable network infrastructure that can support existing AI workloads,\u201d Verizon Business CEO Kyle Malady said in a statement. \u201cAs the technology evolves, our industry leadership, best-in-class edge-to-cloud connectivity, programmable network and assets will enable us to meet these needs and accelerate innovation.\u201d",

As we sit here today, we have 2-10MW+ of usable power across many of our sites.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we move through our network transformation work, we will continue to free up more resources that could be made available for AI Connect,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn addition, we have between 100 and 200 acres of undeveloped land, some currently zoned for data center build and much of it in prime data center-friendly areas.\u201d\n\nAs part of the announcement, Verizon is partnering with hosting firm Vultr, which will be expanding its cloud footprint and GPU availability through Verizon's connectivity infrastructure.\n\nIn the earnings call, Maladay said Vultr will initially deploy its GPU-as-a-Service infrastructure in one of the telco\u2019s data centers and tap into the company\u2019s fiber network for distribution.\n\n\u201cGPUs play a crucial role in powering AI workloads, and rapidly growing demand for real-time inference is driving the need for AI infrastructure at the Edge,\u201d said J.J. Kardwell, CEO of Vultr. \u201cWith demand for data centers and GPU processing power outpacing supply, Verizon\u2019s connectivity infrastructure is uniquely positioned to support our growth. Through Verizon AI Connect, we can extend our global cloud footprint and bring cutting-edge AI solutions to Verizon Business\u2019 global customers.\u201d\n\nMeta will also partner with Verizon on AI Connect, expanding their existing relationship into network infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to deliver critical infrastructure for our apps and technologies, we\u2019re strengthening our network with AI and the future in mind. This means partnering with Verizon to build and operate networks that support our existing services, while accelerating more intelligent and predictive capabilities that will serve the people that use our products,\u201d said Gaya Nagarajan, VP of network infrastructure at Meta.\n\nLate last year, Verizon partnered with Nvidia to launch a new 5G private network with private Mobile Edge Compute (MEC) solution. The offering includes Nvidia\u2019s GPU hardware and software that can bring plug-and-play AI capabilities on-premise for enterprises. Verizon engineers will begin demonstrations of this solution in early 2025.",

            "content": "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nVerizon vs. T-Mobile: Who does 5G home internet better?\n\n5G home internet has been making a lot of noise lately. So, you probably already know that T-Mobile and Verizon are the top players in the game. These two telecom companies dominate the 5G fixed wireless internet space and often compete for customers. But which provider offers an overall better service?\n\nCNET picks T-Mobile Home Internet as the better internet service provider due to its wide availability. You can find coverage in more locations across the country (including rural areas), offering internet connectivity to more people. Verizon 5G home internet has faster speeds but falls short on coverage. In recent years, T-Mobile has also performed better than Verizon when it comes to customer satisfaction. Plus, T-Mobile is usually seen in the top spots for ISP customer satisfaction in the latest 2024 J.D. Power Survey and the 2024 American Customer Satisfaction Index, too.\n\nOffering broadband services in rural areas is important. But in order to maintain competition, T-Mobile Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet must also appeal to urban and suburban customers. T-Mobile has been making headlines by introducing three new plans with faster speeds and some streaming perks that compete with Verizon's perks and streaming add-ons. But keep in mind that overall, the best internet provider for you might be the one that caters to your needs and what's available in your area.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nWe'll give you the key facts on these two providers so you can make an informed decision. We've compiled exhaustive research on speed, pricing, customer care and more to help make that choice easier. Let's dive into the details on Verizon and T-Mobile's home internet plans.\n\nNote: All prices listed on this page reflect available discounts for setting up paperless billing. If you decide not to go with automatic monthly payments, your price will be higher.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet Better coverage and reaches more rural areas Our take - T-Mobile Home Internet is still fairly new on the block, but it's got the widest reach of any fixed wireless internet provider. By utilizing its 4G LTE network and the expanding 5G grid, T-Mobile has aggressively expanded its coverage map and offered its services to more households than Verizon's 5G solution.

That's great news for our phones and other smart gadgets connecting over cellular airwaves. And it could be a game changer for our homes, too. With the potential for near-gigabit speeds over the air that rival cable and fiber internet service providers -- plus the added appeal of straightforward, consumer-friendly terms that ditch data caps, equipment fees and the like -- 5G is shaping up to become one of the most exciting developments in residential internet in years.\n\nT-Mobile\n\n5G signals are extremely convenient -- much more convenient than installing a fiber or cable network -- but the signal doesn't reach everywhere. The first hurdle with 5G home internet service is whether it's available at your address. Though you may get cell service from T-Mobile or Verizon, that doesn't automatically mean you'll get home internet at your address.\n\nVerizon and T-Mobile are the providers doing the most to expand the 5G's availability for home internet use, though the providers recently found a new competitor in AT&T's 5G home internet rollout, AT&T Internet Air. AT&T does not boast the same availability as Verizon or T-Mobile, with a coverage of just 14% of the US, according to the FCC. However, all providers offer dedicated 5G fixed wireless home internet plans that promise fast speeds and simple terms at competitive rates. In some areas, you might even find that your home is serviceable by both Verizon and T-Mobile, as CNET's own Eli Blumenthal discovered in his quest to replace his cable provider.\n\nIf we take a second look at customer satisfaction data, we'll find that 5G internet continues to impress customers, significantly more than wired cable, fiber, DSL or satellite internet services. Time will tell how much 5G stands to disrupt the ISP category. For now, let's continue our look at how Verizon 5G Home and T-Mobile Home Internet match up.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs T-Mobile Home Internet: Plans and pricing\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nAre you tired of deciphering which broadband package to choose out of countless options? Both Verizon and T-Mobile lean into providing a no-strings-attached broadband experience, a welcome relief for many internet users. Each provider offers simplified 5G home internet plans requiring no term agreements, no data caps and no additional monthly equipment fees.\n\nThere are two plan options for Verizon: Verizon 5G Home and Verizon 5G Home Plus. Verizon 5G Home comes with a two-year price guarantee and lower download speeds, while Verizon 5G Home Plus locks in your price for three years, plus higher download speeds and a slew of additional perks, which we'll outline in the perks and promos section below.\n\nT-Mobile now offers three home internet plans, though two of them feature the same speeds. T-Mobile Home Rely Internet costs $50 monthly for speeds ranging between 87 to 318Mbps download and 14-56 upload. T-Mobile Amplified Internet Plus costs $60 for speeds ranging from 133 to 415Mbps download and 12 to 55Mbps upload and T-Mobile All-In Internet costs $70 monthly for the same speeds but with and includes a mesh Wi-Fi router to extend the range of coverage throughout the house and 24/7 \"interactive video support,\" according to T-Mobile's website.\n\nT-Mobile also recently rolled out its Home Internet Backup plan that you can use in the case of power or internet outages or during natural disasters interrupting connectivity. For $20 a month, you get up to 130GB -- which is admittedly, not very much, but this internet option isn't intended for heavy or regular usage. In fact, T-Mobile offers this internet option as a backup to your current internet provider.\n\nWhich is faster?\n\nWhile 5G can reach gigabit download speeds and Verizon advertises its 5G Home Plus plan as maxing out at 1,000Mbps, don't expect those top-end numbers from either provider's home internet product. T-Mobile says on its site that customers can expect \"average download speeds in excess of 100Mbps,\" and that people typically experience ranges from 87 to 318Mbps. Why so relatively low? T-Mobile Home Internet relies on its growing 5G grid and existing 4G LTE network to expedite its availability. So don't expect a pure 5G experience. Still, thanks to upgraded gateway routers, T-Mobile can offer faster speeds on average than previously offered, meaning you could see speeds up to 415Mbps (though probably not consistently). CNET's Amanda Kooser discovered that her speeds were inconsistent after trying out T-Mobile Home Internet at home.\n\n\"During congestion, Home Internet customers may notice speeds lower than other customers due to data prioritization,\" reads the first sentence of T-Mobile Home Internet's general terms. \"Service may be slowed, suspended, terminated, or restricted for misuse, abnormal use, interference with our network or ability to provide quality service to other users.\" In other words, you may experience some slowed internet speeds during peak hours, like after 5 p.m. Unlike with data caps, however, there's no allotment of \"priority data\" and no overage fees for consuming too much data.\n\nOn the other hand, Verizon tells its subscribers to expect average download speeds of around 300Mbps. Verizon's dependence on its Ultra Wideband 5G network (and lesser use of its \"4G LTE backup\") is the main reason for the faster speeds. It uses low-band, midband and millimeter-wave technology to offer speeds that could get as high as 1,000Mbps for some lucky people.\n\nWhich offers the best value?\n\nWhen trying to gauge the best deal for your home, it's essential to look at the cost per Mbps to better understand the actual value.\n\nConsidering the average download speed of 100Mbps for that basic $50 monthly fee, T-Mobile Home Rely Internet rings in at 50 cents per Mbps, comparable to what you might pay for a midrange cable internet plan. If you have a qualifying Go5G Plus or Magenta Max mobile plan, you can trim that to $30 a month or 30 cents per Mbps. T-Mobile Home Amplified Internet comes in at 60 cents comparatively, a steep price without a bundling discount, while T-Mobile All-In Internet rings in at 70 cents.\n\nVerizon 5G Home, which averages 125Mbps, matches that amount at a cost per Mbps of 40 cents. If you choose the Verizon 5G Plus plan, which averages 300Mbps, your monthly bill is $70, but that cost per Mbps goes down to just under 24 cents. Customers with qualifying Verizon mobile plans will get $15 to $25 off the monthly cost of either plan. If you can use that additional discount, it makes Verizon 5G Home -- the regular plan at 28 cents per Mbps and the Plus plan at an even better 15 cents per Mbps -- one of the most affordable out there compared to any cable internet plans by competitors.\n\nWhat about the fine print?\n\nLet's revisit that idea of the no-strings-attached internet experience. Verizon and T-Mobile are eager to get customers to try their 5G home internet offerings, so no hidden fees or taxes are added to the monthly cost. As we mentioned before, there's no contract or data cap. There's also no additional equipment rental fee, installation fee or other trap fees (although T-Mobile does charge a one-time, $35 activation fee), so it's a win-win for both providers and their customers.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: Who can sign up?\n\nFCC\n\nNeither provider offers a detailed coverage map for its 5G home internet solution. However, considering the list of cities they claim to cover and the total number of households, T-Mobile is clearly in the lead here.\n\nWhile Verizon 5G Home Internet is available to approximately 40 million homes nationwide, T-Mobile Home Internet reaches over 50 million households and serves almost 60% of the US population. In contrast, Verizon's 5G service is now available in more than 2,700 cities, covering only 21% of the country.\n\nOverall, T-Mobile Home Internet has just over six million customers (according to a recent report in the fourth quarter of 2024.), while Verizon's latest earnings report shows that the company has added one million subscribers, putting its subscriber base at just over four million. That's a sizable piece of the broadband pie for both upstart fixed wireless offerings.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: Deals and promotions\n\nStill not convinced by the straightforward terms both T-Mobile and Verizon put forward? They'll try to sway you with their promotional offers.\n\nFirst, T-Mobile and Verizon are so confident in their 5G home products that each offers to pay off any early termination fees for new customers who break their current ISP contract, up to $500 for Verizon and $750 from T-Mobile.\n\nSecond, they each offer similar discounts for eligible mobile customers. T-Mobile and Verizon will shave off $15 to $25 if you bundle your home internet with eligible mobile plans.\n\nVerizon also offers some solid perks. All Verizon plans include a price lock of up to five years. Depending on which plan you sign up for, you can expect a $100 to $200 Verizon gift card. Verizon also offers customers a free year-long Netflix and Max subscription (with ads).\n\nComparatively, T-Mobile's latest deal for new customers who sign up online is a prepaid Mastercard card worth $300. The All-In Home Internet plan also features Hulu (with ads) plus a Paramount Plus subscription.\n\nBoth Verizon and T-Mobile offer a price lock for internet, with Verizon pledging a five-year price lock for all plans.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet: What do customers think?\n\nWe refer to two of the top customer satisfaction surveys within our ISP reviews -- J.D. Power and the American Customer Satisfaction Index -- and they consistently place T-Mobile and Verizon at the top of their rankings. Verizon 5G scored just 605 points to T-Mobile's 649 in the J.D. Power study. As the national average in that study was 630, T-Mobile performed extremely well.\n\nACSI\n\nOn the other hand, T-Mobile Home Internet impressively led all nonfiber ISPs with 76 out of 100, well above the ACSI industry average of 68 points. But can you guess which provider was right behind it? Verizon 5G Home Internet took second place, scoring 74 points.\n\nAnecdotally, one of our CNET writers tested T-Mobile during its pilot program and preferred it over his previous provider, Xfinity.\n\nSo, which is it?\n\nT-Mobile and Verizon are still aggressively building their 5G networks, so we're closer to the story's beginning than the middle or end, especially regarding 5G fixed wireless internet overall.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet has a slight edge over Verizon 5G Home Internet in availability and customer satisfaction. Adding its 4G LTE network to 5G makes it a much more viable pick, particularly in rural and underserved areas of the country, where it's a compelling alternative to options like satellite or DSL. Verizon 5G Home Internet takes the lead in performance, featuring nearly triple the current download speeds of T-Mobile Home Internet with the addition of more enticing perks and bundles. As such, T-Mobile may have the upper hand now, but Verizon seems poised to provide a higher upside in the immediate future as the best fixed wireless internet in cities where the two overlap.\n\nVerizon 5G Home vs. T-Mobile Home Internet FAQs\n\nIs T-Mobile Home Internet better than Verizon 5G Home? It depends on how you define \"better.\" T-Mobile Home Internet is available to more households than Verizon 5G Home Internet, so it's got the edge there. Verizon 5G Home boasts a higher average download speed (300Mbps), so it can claim a win in that category. Ultimately, the product that will be best for you is the one that's available at your address and can provide enough download speed to enable your household to do what it needs to do. Show more\n\nWhich internet service provider has the best 5G coverage? Not to sound like a broken record, but it depends on how you define \"best 5G coverage.\" If you're looking strictly at the number of people covered, T-Mobile Home Internet is the ISP with the best 5G coverage. If you define \"best\" by which provider has the better download speed performance, then the winner is Verizon 5G Home Internet. It has a top end of 300Mbps compared to T-Mobile's 245Mbps. Verizon 5G Home Plus is even better, with a maximum of 1,000Mbps in some areas.\n\nCan you work from home using Verizon 5G Home or T-Mobile Home Internet? Yes. Verizon 5G Home Internet and T-Mobile Home Internet should provide near or above the FCC's broadband speed definition of at least 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload. Both fixed wireless products, in urban and suburban areas, won't give you as many options as some cable and fiber providers. On the flip side, Verizon 5G Home and T-Mobile Home Internet are cheaper (especially with their mobile discounts) and you'll have the opportunity to try them out at very little risk to see if they'll be adequate for your home office needs.

            "content": "That said, high-yield stocks aren't entirely off the table. While analysts warn investors about the financial stability of high-yield companies, these stocks have historically delivered solid returns. The research from The Wellington study analyzed the broader market\u2019s dividend-paying stocks from 1930 to 2019, dividing them into five categories based on their dividend yields. The top 20% of dividend payers outshone the rest, with the moderate dividend group also surpassing the broader market in several periods. However, stocks with lower dividend yields showed less consistent performance compared to the broader index.\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks has always been a tug-of-war between those favoring high yields and those backing dividend growth. Analysts suggest that due to economic volatility since 2020 and ongoing market uncertainties impacting corporate earnings, high-yield companies without strong financial stability and discipline may struggle to maintain their dividend payouts. This could leave them at risk of dividend cuts or suspensions. In contrast, dividend growth strategies have proven effective in both rising and falling interest rate environments. According to a report by ProShares, the Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks companies with at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, achieved a 14.26% return during the period of declining interest rates from May 2005 to March 2024, outperforming high-yield stocks, which delivered just over 10%. Similarly, during periods of rising interest rates within the same timeframe, dividend growth stocks returned 10.26%, compared to 9.22% for high-yield stocks.\n\nDividend stocks hold strong appeal for income generation for two main reasons. First, their regular payouts help investors address immediate liquidity needs. Second, historical trends indicate that dividend-paying stocks can help reduce market volatility and limit losses during downturns. Companies with a track record of dividend growth often provide added stability during bearish markets. For instance, between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, during periods of market decline, the High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index outperformed the Composite 1500 and the High Dividend Index, delivering an average monthly outperformance of 140 and 49 basis points, respectively.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best High Dividend Stocks Under $100 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other high dividend stocks under $100.\n\nStory Continues\n\nKirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, encouraged investors to focus on both price appreciation and dividend income when evaluating total returns. She highlighted that dividend-paying stocks bring added advantages, as their steady income can help cushion losses during market downturns, offering stability to a portfolio. Moreover, during periods of low interest rates, these stocks often provide higher income compared to options like Treasury bonds, CDs, or corporate bonds. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cCompanies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.\u201d\n\nCabacungan advised that investors looking for steady income might benefit from focusing on stocks with above-average dividend yields held over the long term. On the other hand, those prioritizing growth without the need for immediate income should consider stocks with a history of steadily increasing dividends. This strategy aligns with a growth-focused approach, enabling investors to capitalize on companies that consistently enhance their dividends as their profits and cash flows expand. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best high-yield stocks under $100.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we first used a stock screener to identify dividend-paying stocks priced below $100 and offering dividend yields above 4% as of January 24. From that selection, we chose 12 companies with strong dividend histories and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2023.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(VZ) the Highest Dividend Stock to Buy on Cash App?\n\nA smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nDividend Yield as of January 24: 6.85%\n\nShare Price as of January 24: $39.54\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is an American multinational telecommunications company. It recently announced its Q4 2024 earnings and posted revenue of $35.7 billion, which showed a 1.6% growth from the same period last year. Revenue growth was driven by strong customer additions in both mobile wireless and internet services. In the mobile wireless segment, the company gained 568,000 net postpaid phone subscribers during the quarter, a notable increase from the 449,000 net additions recorded in the same period last year. Revenue for this segment grew 3.1% year-over-year, reaching $20 billion, marking the 18th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)'s cash generation also came in strong in FY24. The company reported an operating cash flow of $37 billion and its free cash flow came in at $19.8 billion. The free cash flow showed growth from $18.7 billion in the prior-year period. Analysts are providing an optimistic outlook for the company as it has partnered with NVIDIA to develop an AI-driven enterprise solution that enables various AI applications to operate efficiently on its secure 5G private networks with private Mobile Edge Computing. The company is also exploring other AI-based initiatives, including network slicing and satellite connectivity, to create new revenue opportunities and enhance its competitive position.\n\nIn December 2024, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has been raising its payouts for 18 consecutive years, which makes VZ one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock supports a dividend yield of 6.85%, as of January 24.\n\nThird Point Management made the following comment about VZ in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka \u201cwireless cable\u201d) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing\u2019s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper\u2019s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.\u201d\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024, 57 hedge funds owned investments in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), worth over $3.2 billion in total. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall VZ ranks 2nd on our list of the best high dividend stocks under $100. While we acknowledge the potential VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Verizon (VZ -0.32%) pays a monster dividend. At 6.8%, it's one of the 10 highest-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500. That's not exactly a good thing, as higher-yielding dividend stocks tend to have a higher risk profile.\n\nHowever, Verizon's big-time dividend is very safe. That's abundantly clear from the telecom giant's financial results for 2024 and outlook for 2025.\n\nContinued improvement where it matters most\n\nVerizon had a solid year in 2024. The company's total revenue nudged up 0.6% to $134.8 billion thanks to a 3.1% uptick in wireless service revenue. It generated an industry-leading $20 billion of wireless service revenue in the fourth quarter, as its price increases are starting to pay dividends.\n\nThe company produced $36.9 billion in cash flow from operations last year. While that was down from $37.5 billion in 2023 (due to higher taxes and interest expenses), its free cash flow increased to $19.8 billion (from $18.7 billion) thanks to lower capital spending ($17.1 billion in 2024 compared to $18.8 billion in 2023). Verizon's abundant free cash flow more than covered its dividend outlay of $11.2 billion.\n\nVerizon used the cash it retained to strengthen its balance sheet. It ended the year with a net leverage ratio of 2.3 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of 2023. That leverage level supports the company's solid investment-grade bond ratings (A-/BBB+/Baa1).\n\nThe telecom giant's strong free cash flow and falling leverage ratio have made its payout increasingly safer over the past year.\n\nFurther improvements ahead\n\nVerizon expects 2025 to be another solid year. The company anticipates total wireless service revenue will grow by 2% to 2.8% this year. Meanwhile, it sees its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rising 2% to 3.5%. That's an acceleration from the 2.1% increase in adjusted EBITDA it delivered last year. Verizon also expects to deliver adjusted earnings per share from flat to up 3% this year. That's an improvement from 2024, when its adjusted earnings per share declined 2.5%.\n\nThat sets the company up to produce strong cash flow. It plans to use some of that money to increase capital spending to a range of $17.5 billion-$18.5 billion to support the expansion of its wireless, broadband, and AI infrastructure. That positions it to produce between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion in free cash flow. That free cash will easily cover the company's dividend while enabling it to continue strengthening its balance sheet.\n\nVerizon is in a strong position to continue growing beyond 2025. The company has invested heavily in expanding its wireless and broadband networks, which should support its continued growth in the coming years. Meanwhile, it took a big step to enhance its fiber network by sealing a deal to buy Frontier Communications for $20 billion late last year.\n\nThat transaction will enhance its fiber network while positioning it to generate at least $500 million in annual cost synergies. The deal likely won't close until 2026 as it undergoes a lengthy regulatory review.\n\nIn addition, the company sees a robust market opportunity in AI. It has industry-leading assets that will be crucial to providing the infrastructure needed to support AI. It sees a more than $40 billion total addressable market for telecom AI delivery and more than $1 billion of business in the short term by leveraging its existing infrastructure.\n\nVerizon's growth drivers position it to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend. Last year was the 18th in a row it raised its payment, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector.\n\nVerizon's dividend is increasingly safe and secure\n\nVerizon's strategy has started to pay off in recent years. Its heavy investments in building out its 5G and broadband networks are beginning to drive growth. Meanwhile, the company is producing lots of cash, which allows it to continue investing while growing its dividend and strengthening its already solid balance sheet.\n\nBecause of all this, the company's monster dividend is on a very safe foundation. That makes it an attractive option for those seeking a lucrative passive income stream.",

The rebate alone is enough to cover the entire cost of the Galaxy S25 Plus and the gifts are worth well over $500 so you're getting a ton of added value alongside your new flagship phone.\n\nOf course, there are some caveats with this particular promotion.

Right now, the maximum trade-in of up to $1,000 off is enough to get the mid-tier Galaxy S25 Plus for free alongside an Ultimate Unlimited plan and you can also claim a free Galaxy Watch 7 and a tablet if you're willing to spend up to $15/mo extra for the required cellular lines. Note that this deal is also available on the standard Samsung Galaxy S25 but the maximum rebate only reaches up to $800 on this device.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: $1,000 off with a trade-in and unlimited plan, plus free tablet and watch\n\nAnd, if you'd prefer to go for the Ultra, then this week's Verizon deals also stretch to this stunning new flagship. The promotions are the same as those outlined on the Plus just above - meaning you'll be able to get a maximum saving of up to $1,000 on this device as well as a free Galaxy Watch and tablet if you're willing to pay for the associated cellular lines.\n\nMore deals to consider",

It has its roots in the original Bell system and is one of only 3 \u201cbaby Bells\u201d to exist today. The company was spun off from the original Bell network as Bell Atlantic when it was split into 7 companies in 1984. The original home range was from New Jersey to Virginia but, ironically, shortly after the split the baby bells, including Bell Atlantic, began to merge together in order to expand their territories.\n\nBell Atlantic acquired NYNEX, another baby Bell, in a move that expanded operations into New York and New England. MCI was also added, expanding the long-distance services, then the company acquired until-then independent operator GTE and became a national carrier. The company changed its name to Verizon following the GTE merger and it is a blend of the Latin word veritas which means Truth and Horizon.\n\nOver the years, Verizon has expanded its territory and its offerings to include mobile, internet and entertainment. Among the more notable were the purchase and merging of AOL and Yahoo! which were later spun off in a sale to Apollo Global Management. Among the more important changes the company has made was to sell off its land-based wirelines. Verizon began selling off its land-based wirelines in 2005 in order to focus more fully on mobile and Internet technology.\n\nToday, Verizon offers communications, information technology, and entertainment products to consumers globally. The company operates in 2 key segments that include Consumer and Business. The Consumer segment provides wireless connectivity, internet access for mobile devices, and wireless and mobile devices including those for the IoT. As of the end of the year 2021, the company laid claim to more than 143 million retail subscribers and was the largest mobile provider by almost 30%.\n\nThe Business segment provides connectivity at the enterprise level that includes mobile, networking, Internet access, VOIP and video, security and IoT. As of 2021, this segment had more than 27 million wireless and 477,000 broadband connections. Both the Consumer and Business segments are being upgraded to the 5G protocol. At the end of 2022 more than 175 million users were covered by the service.\n\nVerizon is the US's 24th largest company by revenue and a member of both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company has paid a dividend every quarter since it went public in 2000 and had increased the payment for 18 consecutive years as of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The agency will not provide any additional information until they complete their investigation.\n\nA tower technician on a cell phone tower in Burleson, Texas, was critically injured on Friday afternoon after coming into contact with a high-voltage power line.\n\nAccording to Burleson Fire Chief Casey Davis, three workers were on the tower located in the 800 block of North Burleson Boulevard when a call for help was made at 11:50 a.m., reporting that one of the workers had been electrocuted.\n\nWhen firefighters arrived to begin the emergency rescue operation, according to Davis, two of the workers had just descended the tower, but the third individual remained stranded due to his injuries.\n\nTo ensure a safe rescue, Oncor de-energized the adjacent substation at around 1 p.m., temporarily cutting power to approximately 5,000 customers.\n\nBy 3:50 p.m., firefighters had secured the injured worker into a harness and safely lowered him to a fire department ladder truck. Due to the severity of his injuries and exposure to wind and cold, the worker was in critical condition but remained conscious and communicative with rescuers. The firefighters were EMTs, enabling them to assess and provide care during the rescue.\n\nDavis noted that the worker\u2019s condition was promising. He was transported by ambulance to a burn facility for further treatment.\n\nThe 200-foot monopole cell tower, owned by Verizon, is located within a substation perimeter along northbound Interstate 35W, between Burly Corporation and AutoNation.\n\nBurleson\u2019s firefighters received multial aid from Fort Worth Fire.\n\nAt the time of the rescue, authorities had not identified who the tech was nor the company he was employed by working on what appeared to be a Verizon upgrade since they are the only tenant on the structure erected in 1997.\n\nOSHA has been notified of the accident, Davis said.\n\nTen feet: The minimum working distance from power lines\n\nIt is unknown if any line with equipment the crew was using made contact with an energized line or if there was an arc flash.\n\nAccording to rescue photographs and Google Earth measurements, the monopole appears to be about 12 to 16 feet from the nearest electrical line at the substation.\n\nWhen a job safety analysis is performed, overhead power lines near the work site must be identified. The electric utility should be contacted to determine the voltage and mandatory minimum approach distance specified by OSHA and the state\u2019s high voltage safety laws.\n\nOSHA\u2019s minimum distance is 10 feet and it increases as the voltage increases. Work inside of the OSHA or state minimum is prohibited.\n\nThis is not the first time the Burleson Fire Department has performed a high-angle rescue on a communications tower. In 2011, they rescued a tower technician from the top of a 750-foot guyed tower when he suffered from heat exhaustion and could not descend.\n\nThe tech reportedly took his harness off and was lying on an antenna platform. Rescuers were able to talk him back into his harness. It took seven hours to bring him down, sometimes with the temperature soaring to 100 degrees.",

See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nVerizon stock climbs on solid Q4 numbers\n\nVerizon's revenue climbed 1.7% year over year in the fourth quarter, powered by solid mobile wireless and internet-service customer-addition numbers. In the mobile wireless category, the company added 568,000 net postpaid phone additions in the quarter -- representing an acceleration from the 449,000 net adds it posted in the prior-year quarter. Revenue for the segment increased 3.1% year over year to reach $20 billion, marking its 18th consecutive quarter of sequential growth.\n\nOn the internet side of things, the company reported 408,000 net broadband service additions and 373,000 additions for fixed wireless. Meanwhile, Fios net additions came in at 51,000 -- down from 55,000 in the Q4 2023. The company closed out last year with 12.3 million total broadband service connections -- up 15% year over year.-\n\nWhat comes next for Verizon?\n\nWith its Q4 report today, Verizon also announced that it closed out the period with total unsecured debt of $117.9 billion, representing an $8.5 billion decline from where it stood in the previous quarter. The company has continued to post solid results and make progress paying down its debt. On the other hand, the telecom space continues to be highly competitive -- and new entrants are entering key markets for Verizon.\n\nTo its credit, Verizon isn't standing still. It's aiming to shore up its competitive positioning and open up some new growth channels through its acquisition of Frontier Communications -- which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. The extent to which the $20 billion deal winds up being successful will have a significant impact on Verizon stock over the next five years.\n\nThe company is also looking to artificial intelligence (AI) as a key growth driver, and it's possible that partnerships with Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms could wind up yielding some significant performance catalysts.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Verizon Communications wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "What is the best internet provider in Los Angeles?\n\nIf you can get it, AT&T Fiber is the top internet provider in the Los Angeles: the birthplace of Hollywood and home of the Dodgers. With so much going for it, you'd expect better fiber availability, but it falls short. AT&T Fiber offers the fastest median download speeds, no contracts and included equipment. However, if you're looking for something cheaper, check out Frontier Fiber's $30 200Mbps plan. It offers symmetrical download and upload speeds.\n\nLast but not least, if you're on the hunt for the fastest speeds in Los Angeles, Sonic Telecom offers an incredible deal. With speeds of up to 10,000Mbps at just $50 a month, it's an exceptional value -- if it's available in your area.\n\nLos Angeles internet providers compared undefined Provider Internet technology Monthly price range Speed range Monthly equipment costs Data cap Contract CNET review score AT&T Fiber\n\nRead full review Fiber $55-$245 300-5,000Mbps None None None 7.4 Cox Communications\n\nRead full review Cable $30-$150 100-2,000Mbps $15 (optional) 1.25TB None 6.2 Frontier Communications\n\nRead full review Fiber $30-$300 200-7,000Mbps None None None 6 Sonic Fiber $50-$60 10,000Mbps $5 (optional) None None N/A Spectrum\n\nRead full review Cable $25-$70 100-1,000Mbps Free modem; $10 router None None 7.2 Starry Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $15-$75 100-1,000Mbps None None None 7 T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$55 for eligible mobile customers) 87-415Mbps None None None 7.4 Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$45 for eligible Verizon Wireless customers) 50-250Mbps None None None 7.2 Show more (3 items) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nOther available internet providers in Los Angeles\n\nCox Communications: Although it's one of the country's biggest cable internet providers, Cox has a relatively small footprint in the Los Angeles metro area. It's solely available in the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Plans start at $30 per month for 100Mbps download and go up to $150 per month for its 2-gigabit option.\n\nFrontier Communications: Frontier has a notable presence in the Los Angeles market. Its DSL and fiber-optic service are scattered throughout the area, including some of Beverly Hills, Long Beach, the San Fernando Valley, Santa Monica and portions of western LA. Similar to our guidance on AT&T, if Frontier's DSL service is the only option at your address, seek other alternatives. If Frontier Fiber is available -- which has options for 200Mbps up to 7Gbps symmetrical speeds starting at $30 to $300 per month -- you'd be hard-pressed to find a better option.\n\nSonic Telecom: This ISP is mainly known for offering service in the Bay Area. Angelenos can find Sonic service in a handful of neighborhoods, including Beverly Hills, Glendale, Inglewood, Pasadena and West Hollywood. Although Sonic is known for building 100% fiber networks, much of its offering in the LA market is older DSL, and most of its fiber service in the area currently utilizes AT&T's fiber network.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet: T-Mobile's fixed wireless home internet service uses its 5G and 4G LTE networks to get customers online at an average download speed between 87 and 415Mbps. It's appealing for its simplicity: $50 a month covers all equipment, taxes, installation fees and services. Get faster speeds at $60 a month. For $70 a month, you can include a Mesh Access Point and a Wi-Fi Gateway for more reliable speeds throughout the house. There are no data caps and no contracts required. Although technically available throughout the Los Angeles metro area, you must plug in your address on the T-Mobile site to see if you're serviceable.\n\nVerizon 5G Home Internet: Like T-Mobile, this is a fixed wireless home internet option. Verizon's average download speeds are around 250Mbps. It also features an all-in price that covers taxes, installation fees and equipment but splits the cost into two buckets: $50 a month for a two-year price-lock guarantee or $70 per month for a three-year price-lock and additional perks.\n\nCitizen of the Planet/Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nCheap internet options in Los Angeles\n\nThe average starting price for internet service in Los Angeles is approximately $45 monthly. If you're looking for the most affordable internet plans in your area, multiple options are available that are cheaper than the average cost. The cheapest plan is Starry Connect, which costs $15 per month and offers speeds up to 30Mbps but will only be available to qualifying users.\n\nWhat's the cheapest internet plan in Los Angeles?\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nHow to find internet deals and promotions in Los Angeles\n\nThe best internet deals and top promotions in Los Angeles depend on what discounts are available during that period.

Others, such as AT&T, Frontier and Verizon, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nHow fast is Los Angeles broadband?\n\nLos Angeles isn't among the top 50 fastest cities in the US. A big reason is that 100% fiber connections are not yet as prevalent as cable and DSL connections in the city. Major efforts by AT&T (making its Fiber 2000 and Fiber 5000 plans more widely available) and Frontier (whose 2- and 5-gigabit plans are now available for all locations serviceable for its fiber offerings) should help boost those stats.\n\nFastest internet plans in Los Angeles\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\n\nInternet providers in popular cities near Los Angeles\n\nSee all results for internet providers in California.\n\nWhat's a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the Federal Communication Commission. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Los Angeles\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What's our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes. All information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answers to those questions are often layered and complex, but the providers that come closest to \"yes\" on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nWhat's the final word on internet providers in Los Angeles?\n\nSpectrum is tough to beat among Los Angeles internet providers if you want consistent service and wide availability. Sonic is the fastest ISP in the city, but AT&T and Frontier's fiber plans are also tough to beat. Overall, change is coming over the next few years in the City of Angels as providers like AT&T and Frontier move away from their older DSL lines (still prominent in the area) toward their growing fiber networks. Cable internet still rules in LA, but fiber is the future.\n\nInternet providers in Los Angeles FAQs\n\nHow much does internet service cost in Los Angeles? Most internet providers in Los Angeles offer at least three different tiers, ranging in price from a low of $15 to a high of $245 per month. The average starting cost for a provider's cheapest plan is $45 per month. Remember that some providers also charge an additional cost to rent their modem and router. Show more\n\nIs fiber internet available in Los Angeles? Yes. Although fiber internet connections aren't as prevalent in Los Angeles as cable internet or DSL, about 30% of residents throughout Los Angeles County can get fiber internet, per FCC stats. Top fiber internet providers in Los Angeles include AT&T and Frontier. Show more\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Los Angeles? Looking only at the starting price, the cheapest internet provider in Los Angeles would be Starry, with its low-cost internet plan Starry Connect for $15 per month. Starry Connect differs from low-cost internet plans offered by other ISPs by eliminating the need to see if your household qualifies: to get Starry Connect, you just need to live in a building that's serviceable for it. Other cheap internet options in Los Angeles are Frontier Fiber and Starry's $30 monthly plans for 200Mbps. Although Starry may be more widely available than Frontier in the city, Frontier's full-fiber symmetrical download and upload speeds make that option pretty hard to pass up if it's available to you.

            "content": "Some stocks pay juicy dividends for a while only for the income to later dwindle. Others generate consistent and reliable dividends over the long run.\n\nWant decades of passive income? Here are three stocks to buy now and hold forever.\n\n1. Chevron\n\nChevron (CVX 2.22%) has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years. The oil and gas producer doesn't just have an impressive dividend track record, though. Its forward dividend yield of 4.15% is also appealing.\n\nThe company's history dates back to 1879 when it was known as Pacific Coast Oil Company. Today, Chevron ranks as the world's third largest oil and gas producer with a market cap of more than $280 billion and annual revenue approaching $200 billion.\n\nDecades ago, some predicted that the world's oil reserves would soon peak and then decline. Chevron continues to disprove those predictions. Its net reserve additions between 2013 and 2023 easily exceeded its production and sales. Technological advancements should enable the company to at least maintain production at current levels for many years to come.\n\nOne technology could especially help Chevron keep the dividends flowing: carbon capture and storage (CCS). In 2023, the company expanded a joint venture that's building the largest CCS hub in the U.S. Chevron's goal is to capture 25 million metric tons of carbon per year by the end of this decade.\n\n2. Pfizer\n\nPfizer (PFE 0.47%) paid its 345th consecutive quarterly dividend on Jan. 24, 2025. The big pharmaceutical company has increased its dividend every year since 2010. I expect that streak to continue with Pfizer's management consistently placing a high priority on growing the dividend. Income investors should love Pfizer's forward dividend yield of 6.51%.\n\nTwo cousins, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, founded Pfizer in 1849. The company is now one of the world's largest drugmakers with a market cap of around $150 billion and annual revenue of close to $60 billion. Pfizer markets 12 blockbuster drugs, including blood thinner Eliquis and oral COVID-19 antiviral therapy Paxlovid.\n\nSure, Pfizer faces some headwinds over the next few years. Several of its top products will lose patent protection. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also selected some of Pfizer's drugs to be on the list for Medicare price negotiations, which could impact revenue.\n\nHowever, Pfizer has successfully navigated challenges in the past. I fully expect it will do so again. The company has several newer drugs that are key growth drivers (and haven't been on the market long enough to make Medicare's list for price negotiations). It also has a promising pipeline that features 108 candidates in clinical development.\n\n3. Verizon Communications\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ -0.32%) has increased its dividend for 18 consecutive years. The telecommunications leader is also a passive income machine with its forward dividend yield of 6.98%.\n\nTechnically, Verizon is the youngest of the three companies on this list. It was founded in 2000 with the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. However, Verizon's roots through Bell Atlantic go back to 1877 with the creation of the American Bell Telephone Company.\n\nVerizon today is one of the world's biggest telecom companies with a market cap of $163 billion and annual revenue of roughly $134 billion. It could soon grow even larger with the pending acquisition of Frontier Communications.\n\nMergers and acquisitions are an important part of Verizon's growth strategy. However, the company should have other major growth opportunities in the future, notably including the anticipated rollout of 6G networks over the next few years.",

That's why you need to stick with boosters primarily from the big four companies: Cel-Fi, HiBoost, SureCall, and weBoost. Cheaper boosters available from Amazon often aren't FCC-certified, which means they can cause trouble with surrounding cell sites and networks.\n\nDo Cell Phone Boosters Really Work?\n\nBoosters help the most when you have a weak signal\u2014not when there's none at all. Whereas your phone shows bars, wireless industry folks measure signal in -dBm. A number higher than about -90dBm (like -80 or -70) is a strong signal. Anything below -110dBm is definitely weak, and you might not hold onto any signal below -120dBm. Services like CellMapper can show you the signal you're receiving on your phone.\n\nIf you're hesitant to invest in a home booster and primarily need coverage to make phone calls, be sure to try Wi-Fi calling. All of the major carriers support this feature, and you can often get better call performance over your home\u2019s Wi-Fi connection.\n\nHow Do Cell Phone Boosters Work?\n\nThe basic principle behind signal boosters is simple: A big antenna is better than a small one. Instead of relying on the tiny antenna in your phone, boosters capture a cellular signal using a large antenna in your window or outside your home (or car), pass that signal through a device that cleans and amplifies it, and send it out through a rebroadcaster inside your home.\n\nBoosters generally have three main components: an external antenna that sits outside your home, a booster that cleans and amplifies the signal, and an antenna you keep inside. A coaxial cable connects them all.\n\nSome products combine the booster and indoor antenna in one unit, therefore making them easier to install and place. But if you own a larger home and are willing to run some coax cable, you can greatly extend the booster\u2019s range with some splitters and several panel antennas. This can get complicated, so, at this point, you might want to get a professional installer to set the system up (especially to reduce interference between multiple in-home antennas).\n\nMost boosters handle bands 2, 4, 5, 12, 13, 17, and 66. That includes base coverage bands for AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. The important missing band is 71, T-Mobile's 600MHz rural coverage band. Because it took a while for TV stations to get out of that band, the FCC hasn't approved any consumer boosters for band 71. If you want to boost that band, you need to get an industrial booster such as the WilsonPro 710i or SureCall Force8.\n\nMost home boosters also boost between 64 and 71dB of signal. Once again, that's due to FCC regulations. If you need more of a boost than that, you need to move up to Cel-Fi's single-carrier booster line, which can get to 100dB by boosting only the frequencies from one wireless carrier at a time.\n\nThe booster store Waveform has a comprehensive guide to how boosters work on its site.\n\nWhat Is the Best Cell Phone Booster for Cars?\n\nBoosters for your car are similar to in-home boosters, with one exception: You can only get single-device, in-car cradle boosters. These are much less powerful than in-home boosters (the ones we tested boost by 23dB instead of between 65 and 75dB) but are less expensive, take seconds to install and remove, and don't radiate beyond the cradle that grips your phone. We like the weBoost Drive Sleek as a single-device booster.\n\nRV owners and people who need to boost multiple devices in a vehicle can get in-car boosters with small radiating antennas that handle several devices. These can be tricky, though, because of how close the output antenna is to the input antenna.\n\nHow Do You Install a Cell Phone Booster?\n\nYou can install all retail cellular boosters by yourself without any drilling, although ideally, you should hide the cables against your baseboards. You also need to find the optimal antenna position outside your home.\n\nBoth SureCall and weBoost have options that let you lean on a professional installer to handle the tricky bits, like sticking the antenna on your roof and orienting it properly. SureCall works with Dish subsidiary OnTech to install any of its boosters for an extra fee. weBoost sells a specific product, the $1,499.99 Home Complete Installed, which includes the installation fee. If you want to do the setup yourself, the standalone Home Complete booster is $999.99.\n\nCan You Boost 5G Signal?\n\nCellular boosters generally can't boost the \"good parts\" of 5G networks. AT&T and Verizon carry a small amount of 5G on the old cellular bands 2 and 5. Boosters handle that, so a booster may summon you a 5G icon, but that signal doesn't give you an experience that's much different from 4G. The fastest 5G networks for AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon are currently on bands n41, n77, n260, and n261; no consumer boosters support those bands reliably.\n\nThere is a sneaky way around this. Although no powered boosters work with these bands, passive antennas can still improve the signal. They may only get you 10dB to 20dB of gain as opposed to 70dB, but that isn't insignificant (and even just the fact that the antenna is outside can help).\n\nIf you are willing to take on a bit of an installation project, the Waveform's Griddy parabolic antenna and MIMO panel antennas improve signal on the 5G band n77. Connecting an outdoor cellular antenna to a Wi-Fi hotspot that has a TS9 connector, such as the Netgear Nighthawk M6, can also turn an outdoor cell signal into an indoor Wi-Fi signal.\n\nDon't Forget to Boost Your Wi-Fi Signal\n\nCellular signals aren't the only ones that can benefit from a boost. Check out these quick tips to improve the wireless signal from your router, extend and optimize your Wi-Fi coverage, and speed up your surfing. You can also go right to our roundups of the best range extenders.\n\nBen Moore, Dave LeClair, and Sascha Segan contributed to this story.",

The carrier\u2019s top executives also highlighted its fixed wireless, 5G and private networking wins in 2024.\n\n\n\nVerizon ripped the sheets off AI Connect, the carrier\u2019s AI strategy and suite of services for enterprises and cloud providers during its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings call Friday morning.\n\nAI Connect is designed to manage resource-intensive AI applications. Through the strategy, Verizon will introduce new tools and use its existing assets, such as the carrier\u2019s network connectivity and edge compute offerings, in new ways to service the AI revolution, whether the AI workloads are across a multi-cloud environment, deployed on a customer\u2019s premise or at the edge of the networks, said Executive Vice President and CEO of the Verizon Business Group Kyle Malady.\n\n\u201cCustomers want to control where and when AI workloads are running, and to that we are building new capabilities to give users more insight and control via new tools. Essentially, we are allowing them to program their network resources to optimize their operation as they see fit,\u201d he said. \u201c[For] edge compute, as AI shifts from training to deep deployment, the need for distributed computing will become increasingly important for real-time decisions and predictions.\u201d\n\nVerizon already has the infrastructure to support AI Connect. The carrier\u2019s \u201cthousands\u201d of distributed telecom facilities already have power, space and cooling available, Malady said.\n\nThe carrier is seeing increasing demand for AI Connect offers, he said, adding that Verizon currently has a funnel of more than $1 billion when leveraging its existing infrastructure. Google Cloud and Meta are among Verizon\u2019s customers as the hyperscalers have purchased capacity on Verizon\u2019s network with the intent of using it for AI workloads, Malady said.\n\n\u201cVerizon\u2019s ability to be a foundational player in the AI ecosystem is clear,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Verizon, we see ourselves as not just participants in this AI-driven future, but as a key player enabling its success. \u2026 The bottom line is we are ready to power AI.\u201d\n\n[Related: 5 Private Networking Companies To Watch In 2025]\n\nWireless Wins\n\nVerizon sustained the tempo it\u2019s seeing in mobility, fixed wireless and 5G in 2024 and that will continue into 2025, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said during the carrier\u2019s fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call.\n\nVerizon\u2019s private networks business continues to grow, and the carrier announced significant wins during 2024, including being selected for an IT systems modernization project from Xerox. Verizon also expanded its service from every NFL stadium in the country to individual teams and their training facilities.\n\nVerizon added nearly 1 million postpaid mobile and broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter, which marked the best quarterly result in more than a decade. Verizon\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 total wireless service revenue of $20 billion was up 3.1 percent year over year. The carrier\u2019s full-year wireless service revenue hit $79.1 billion, which was also up 3.1 percent when compared to 2023\u2019s result.\n\nVerizon in September 2024 revealed plans to acquire Frontier Communications in an all-cash deal valued at $20 billion. The carrier hopes that the deal for Dallas-based Frontier, which is in the backyard of Verizon\u2019s largest rival, AT&T, will help win Verizon more telecommunications market share. The pending deal is expected to close in early 2026.\n\nThe company also in 2024 agreed to buy a portion of U.S Cellular\u2019s low- and midband spectrum licenses for $1 billion as the fifth largest mobile network operator in the country sheds parts of its portfolio in preparation for its own deal to be acquired by T-Mobile.\n\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Results\n\nTotal operating revenue for Verizon Business, which includes the company\u2019s Enterprise, Business Markets, and public sector and wholesale businesses, continued to trend downward, slipping 1.5 percent on revenue of $7.50 billion during the fourth quarter compared with $7.62 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nEnterprise and public sector continued to decline, falling 4.6 percent during fourth-quarter 2024 to $3.55 billion compared with $3.72 billion a year ago.\n\nBusiness Markets and other revenue rose 3.6 percent during the fourth quarter to $3.44 billion compared with $3.32 billion in the year-ago period. Wholesale revenue fell 11 percent to $518 million during fourth-quarter 2024 from $582 million one year before.\n\nVerizon Business wireless service revenue in fourth-quarter 2024 was a bright spot at $3.48 billion, an increase of 3.4 percent year over year, which the company attributed to continued strong net additions for mobility and fixed wireless access, as well as pricing actions implemented in recent quarters. Verizon Business reported 142,000 postpaid phone net additions during the quarter.\n\nFor the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Verizon reported operating revenue of $35.68 billion, a 1.6 percent increase compared with fourth-quarter 2023\u2019s result. For the full 2024 year, Verizon\u2019s operating revenue increased slightly by 0.6 percent.\n\nThe carrier\u2019s consolidated net income was $5.11 billion compared with a net loss of $2.57 billion a year ago. Verizon reported diluted earnings per share of $1.18 compared with 64 cents in fourth-quarter 2023. The company\u2019s diluted earnings per share for the full year was $4.14 compared with $2.75 in 2023.\n\nThe Basking Ridge, N.J.-based carrier beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $35.3 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter of the year.",

            "content": "Verizon announced AI Connect, a suite of networking options for AI delivery\n\nThe operator is one of many looking to cash in on growing AI demand\n\nBut hype doesn't necessarily guarantee success for CSPs, Gartner told Fierce\n\nCa-CHING. That was presumably the sound bouncing around in Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg\u2019s head this morning when the company announced AI Connect, a new suite of networking offerings aimed squarely at the rapidly-growing artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nIn a nutshell, AI Connect is the vehicle through which Verizon intends to peddle its fiber, land and 5G assets to data center companies and enterprises hungry for AI connectivity. The idea, Vestberg explained on its Q4 2024 earnings call, is to use its existing assets to generate new revenue streams that can help offset legacy wireline declines.\n\nScott Lawrence, SVP and Chief Product Officer at Verizon Business, told Fierce Verizon AI Connect isn\u2019t just a repackaging of the edge compute capabilities it launched with AWS a few years back like we'd originally suspected.\n\nInstead, it will build on those capabilities, providing access to the excess space, power and cooling capacity it has at its thousands of existing data centers and retrofitted central office (CO) facilities, as well as access to more than 100 acres of undeveloped land it has in key data center markets. Customers can also tap into Verizon\u2019s local (i.e., Fios), metro and long-haul (see also, OneFiber) fiber assets for dark fiber and wavelength connectivity.\n\nWhy is Verizon doing this? Well, while much of the oxygen in AI conversations is consumed by discussions about GPUs and compute, \u201cthe role the network has in distribution of AI workloads at scale cannot be underestimated,\u201d Lawrence said. All in all, Verizon is chasing what it sees as a $40 billion total addressable market for telco AI delivery.\n\nThe role the network has in distribution of AI workloads at scale cannot be underestimated. Scott Lawrence, SVP and Chief Product Officer, Verizon Business\n\nIf this all sounds vaguely familiar, that\u2019s because it is.\n\nAll aboard\n\nGartner analyst Susan Welsh de Grimaldo told Fierce that by 2027, half of communications service providers will have redesigned their optical transport architectures and added fiber to cater to generative AI\u2019s bandwidth and latency requirements.\n\nAnd indeed, Verizon is already in good company chasing the AI networking opportunity. As we noted in October, AT&T, Lumen Technologies, Frontier Communications and Ziply Fiber have all also started using their old COs for colocation and other cloud deployments.\n\nRelated Telcos have the perfect edge cloud infrastructure for AI up their sleeve\n\nAdditionally, both Lumen and Zayo are tackling the long haul fiber transport needs of data center operators as AI grows. The former has already closed $5 billion in hyperscale networking deals and has another $7 billion in the pipeline.\n\nMeanwhile, Zayo said this week said it is building 5,000 route miles of new fiber between now and 2030 to meet skyrocketing demand for AI networking. It added it already closed more than $1 billion in AI-related networking deals in 2024 and has another $3 billion in the pipeline.\n\nRelated Hyperscalers are buying what Lumen is selling\n\nLawrence said Verizon is already positioned in a close third place when it comes to third-party data center connectivity, with a $1 billion-plus funnel of interest in its core assets that is \u201cactively growing.\u201d There\u2019s also \u201ctremendous interest\u201d from companies interested in tapping into Verizon\u2019s existing data centers, retrofitted COs and undeveloped land in key data center markets.\n\nIndeed, the operator today announced a partnership with Vultr, through which Lawrence said Vultr is deploying GPU assets at Verizon\u2019s edge locations. It also announced an expansion of its partnership with Meta to include network infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually delivered metro fiber solutions that are reflected in our fourth quarter results,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not announcing deals that will take years to build into the future, we\u2019re actually delivering it today. We\u2019re meeting the market where it is today while building for the future,\" he said.\n\nVultr is using CO facilities that have already been upgraded, but Lawrence said plenty more can be made available with retrofits within six to 12 months. He added each CO can provide anywhere from 2MW to 10MW of available power, and water infrastructure for liquid cooling can be added as needed.\n\nMoney for those upgrades (as well as fiber extensions to near-net locations), he noted, has already been factored into the guidance Verizon provided to investors.\n\n5G differentiator\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing Verizon has that Lumen, Zayo, Frontier and Ziply don\u2019t \u2013 a 5G network. Lawrence said that will particularly come in handy when the expected transition from centralized training to inferencing at the edge comes to fruition.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a highly distributed compute environment, but you\u2019re also going to see those models range all the way from the cloud, to edge to the device. So, activating our macro 5G network, specifically with network slicing, will also allow us to create segmentation across our asset base,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, Lawrence noted Verizon is working with Nvidia to incorporate GPUs into its private 5G offerings, bringing compute on-prem for those who need it.\n\nNo guarantees\n\nWelsh de Grimaldo said for operators it \u201cmakes sense to use existing assets to drive new value propositions and revenue \u2013 especially as they are going to bear the costs of supporting growing traffic for AI applications.\u201d\n\nThe catch, though, is that just because AI is hyped and growing rapidly does not mean operators will be successful in their efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s early stages \u2013 you are not going to learn how to drive growth if you are not participating as a key player in the AI ecosystem,\u201d she concluded. \u201cTelcos like Verizon and others are taking their seat at the table, to learn and with aims to lead.",

            "content": "Santiago \u201cYago\u201d Tenorio joined Verizon as its new CTO after a storied career at Vodafone in the UK\n\nThe open RAN guru observes some common ground between Verizon and Vodafone\n\nHe also questions how the industry defines \u2018open RAN\u2019\n\nIs open RAN dead? Santiago \u201cYago\u201d Tenorio, the open RAN trailblazer who left Vodafone for Verizon late last year, hears that question a lot.\n\nThe short answer: No. The longer one but perhaps not what everyone wants to hear: Maybe the industry needs to re-examine what it really means by \u201copen RAN.\u201d\n\nSpun out of a desire by operators to break the vendor \u201clock-in\u201d that vendors like Ericsson and Nokia commandeered, open RAN \u2013 short for the oh-so-catchy \u201cRadio Access Network\u201d \u2013 was launched years ago as a way to enable operators to mix and match products from different vendors. The advantages of an open RAN strategy: more competition in price and availability. That was the idea, anyway.\n\nStuff happened. The Open RAN Alliance emerged as the body overseeing specs for open RAN, officially known as O-RAN. Nokia got involved, and so did Ericsson, which won AT&T\u2019s open RAN business in an eye-popping $14 billion deal in 2023. Some smaller vendors fell off the radar \u2013 and/or their prospects started looking shaky as hell.\n\nTL;DR version: Much of what\u2019s transpired boils down to single-vendor open RAN deployments, going right back to where it all started from. Sort of.\n\nBut it\u2019s more complicated than that. Because, of course it is.\n\nRAN: The more the merrier\n\nVerizon ditched Nokia as a wireless RAN vendor years ago, awarding a contract to Samsung instead. Its other major infrastructure vendor is Ericsson.\n\nRAN usually is the biggest line item in a mobile operator\u2019s budget, and having supply chain \u201coptionality\u201d is a good thing, Tenorio said.\n\nIn fact, for a domain like radio, it\u2019s not healthy to have only two vendors to choose from. \u201cYou can debate what is the right number, but certainly it is not two,\u201d and probably not three, either, he told Fierce. \u201cYou need four or five. That would be a more competitive landscape.\u201d\n\nCan an operator like Verizon afford not to consider Nokia? \u201cI don\u2019t think you can because there are not enough vendors. That\u2019s the problem \u2026 We don\u2019t have enough vendors in this space now,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, even though Nokia already lost most of the North American business, unless it really screws up, it could have another shot at Verizon\u2019s radio business sometime in the future. Unless, of course, upstart radio vendors emerge to take its place.\n\nAs an example of Verizon\u2019s open RAN commitment, Tenorio pointed to a distributed antenna system (DAS) deployment in Texas that includes gear from Samsung and CommScope.\n\nIt\u2019s the first DAS commercially deployed in the Verizon network using open RAN interfaces with various components from different vendors. Samsung is providing its virtual distributed units (vDU) with an O-RAN interface to a CommScope DAS.\n\nAre we likely to see more of these deployments? Certainly, where it makes sense to deliver a better experience for customers, \u201cwe absolutely will replicate that in similar opportunities for in-building systems,\u201d he said.\n\nVerizon-Vodafone ties\n\nSince joining Verizon in late October, Tenorio has observed some similarities between the U.S. operator and his old stomping grounds in the U.K. It\u2019s worth nothing that these two companies are not exactly strangers; Vodafone at one time owned a 45% stake in Verizon Wireless.\n\nAs for open RAN, Verizon\u2019s vRAN stack, which includes more than 130,000 O-RAN capable radio deployments in the U.S., is similar to what Vodafone deployed in the U.K., in the sense that they both use Samsung software, Wind River\u2019s operating system and off-the-shelf servers.\n\n\u201cThe architecture is the same, the concept is the same and the vendors coincide, to a certain extent. When I was at Vodafone, that\u2019s what I would call open RAN. Verizon has traditionally called that vRAN. I think it\u2019s a semantic thing,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Verizon tips its hand on open RAN with new CTO appointment\n\nIn fact, Verizon\u2019s vRAN deployment may be the largest of any brownfield operator in the world, he said. But he\u2019s not apologizing if the overall open RAN deployments thus far are not measuring up to everyone\u2019s expectations.\n\n\u201cI think the industry kind of created some expectations in terms of the timing for open RAN that were probably not realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on people being disappointed because open RAN didn\u2019t follow the expectations that they created themselves.\u201d\n\nThe industry can debate open RAN and its prospects until the cows come home \u2013 or until the big industry trade show known as Mobile World Congress 2025 closes its doors in Barcelona in early March. But then it will surely endure for months on end after that. Probably years, if history is any indication.\n\nAsked about Verizon\u2019s open RAN deployment thus far, analyst Earl Lum of EJL Wireless Research, who famously predicted the demise of Nokia at AT&T, said he doesn\u2019t consider it truly open RAN.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right now, but could be at some point down the road,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s \u2018open RAN ready.\u2019 As far as I know, there\u2019s no Samsung vRAN unit talking to an Ericsson radio.\u201d\n\nFrom the UK to NJ\n\nTo be sure, open RAN isn\u2019t Tenorio\u2019s only jam. Amid a wide-ranging discussion that included his thoughts on the advantages of the Verizon Cloud Platform and a promising future for APIs, Tenorio talked about his decision to upend his roots and move 3,000 miles away to start anew at Verizon.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years at Vodafone, it was like family to him, he said. Shortly before his departure, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in the U.K., one of the most prestigious industry honors that few professionals achieve.\n\n\u201cI made a fabulous career in that company. I gave the best of me to Vodafone and Vodafone gave me a phenomenal set of opportunities. I had fun. I made a career. I can only say good things about Vodafone, and I would have happily stayed there and retired, but the opportunity came up for this job.\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t turn it down. \u201cHow can I say no to an opportunity to start in another company that I admire, in the only other operator I would probably work for?,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and his family relocated to Jersey City, N.J., with a striking view of New York City and a short commute to Verizon\u2019s headquarters in Basking Ridge. It\u2019s been worth the move, both professionally and personally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new adventure.\u201d",

            "content": "A new batch of Samsung phones just got announced yesterday, which means all of the web's biggest retailers and wireless carriers alike are competing to see who can offer the best Galaxy S25 deals. For example, if you add a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan and trade in pretty much any Android phone at Verizon, you'll get $1,000 in promo credits over 36 months, enough to make the super-balanced S25 Plus completely free.\n\nAnd when I say nearly ANY Android phone, I mean it: devices dating all the way back to the original Galaxy S (2010) will you the full $1,000 of credit when you add a new line. No kidding. The only catch is that you're limited to trading in devices from Apple, Google, or Samsung (sorry, Motorola users). To sweeten the deal, Verizon will also throw in a free Galaxy Watch 7 or Galaxy Tab S9 FE, which means you could be getting over $1,500 of free stuff when you preorder.\n\nVerizon isn't messing around with its Galaxy S25 preorder deals\n\nJust like its predecessor, the Galaxy S25 Plus is all about balance. You get a gorgeous 6.7-inch AMOLED 2X 120Hz display straight out of the box, plus 12GB of RAM, the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features. You also get some new DSLR-style camera bumps, and like the rest of the S25 series, seven years of OS/security updates guaranteed.\n\nNow, it's true, Verizon deals typically come with a lot of fine print, so this offer won't be for everyone. Unlimited Ultimate is also Verizon's most expensive data plan, so be sure to look closely at everything it offers before you commit. If you're happy with your current wireless plan, for instance, you may be better off going with one of the S25 deals that lets you preorder the phone unlocked.\n\nBut if you're interested in using one of the best unlimited plans in the business, this deal is a great way to get yourself a free Samsung phone, a free smartwatch or tablet, AND some excellent Verizon coverage in one fell swoop.",

(NYSE:VZ) stands against other stocks expected to post impressive earnings this week.\n\nThe earnings season is in full flow as we kick off the week with earnings from big names like Netflix and United Airlines. Most of the big names are expecting a positive earnings report with some even hitting 52-week highs in anticipation of the upcoming earnings.\n\nThe S&P is up 0.5% while the Dow is about to hit the 1% mark, reflecting the positive sentiment among the US traders. We decided to compile a list of the top names scheduled to announce their earnings this week, looking at what was driving the optimism behind their earnings.\n\nTo come up with the list of 10 stocks expected to post impressive earnings this week, we only considered stocks with a market cap of over $30 billion that are scheduled to announce their earnings this week.\n\nIs Verizon. (VZ) Expected To Post Impressive Earnings This Week?\n\nA smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a communications giant that has struggled to reward its shareholders in the last few years. The stock is currently trading below $40, a level that makes it quite an attractive investment.\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is aggressively expanding its Fixed Wireless segment. The segment is responsible for considerable subscriber growth as well as an uptick in sales per user. The telecom company intends to double its subscriber base by 2028, so the aggressive plans make sense. If the company can achieve that, it will have over 90 million connected households with 8 to 9 million subscribers. Investors will have their eyes on these numbers in the earnings report rather than the revenue and EPS.\n\nThe stock also has a 7% dividend yield that will keep attracting income investors despite the stock\u2019s dismal performance in the recent past.\n\nVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is not on our latest list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 57 hedge fund portfolios held VZ at the end of the third quarter which was 67 in the previous quarter.\n\nOverall, VZ ranks 1st on our list of stocks expected to post impressive earnings this week. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

            "content": "It left without warning. One second I had 600Mbps of broadband connectivity coursing through my home, the next second, I did not. It blipped out, and four working-from-home souls cried out in agony.\n\nSince I've had brief outages in my Verizon FiOS home broadband service before, I initially chose patience, and waited almost silently, my hands paused over my laptop, willing it to return. It did not, and for the next 72 hours we cobbled together connectivity from the two-bar LTE Verizon wireless connectivity available in my New York neighborhood.\n\nHere's what happens when your home broadband goes offline. Your Wi-Fi still works, and teases you with a solid connection but zero communication with the outside world. Local Wi-Fi doesn't need the internet to work, but it's essentially an empty vessel. The connection is devoid of useful information. There is no cloud.\n\nThe wilderness\n\nFor the next three days, all my WiFi-connected smart home devices reverted to analog or ceased working altogether. One family member texted me (texting worked over LTE) that they were cold and wanted me to adjust the Nest Learning Thermostat from my phone. I told them they'd have to leave their room to do it, because I couldn't control a thing from my mobile command center.\n\nSiri could still hear me say her name, but couldn't answer any questions, and my Alexa-connected alarm clock lost track of the weather. All of my smart cameras became dumb. My Bird Buddy was no longer my friend, and birds landed, ate seed, and flew away all in front of a blind webcam.\n\nWe don't have traditional cable or an antenna, which meant our TV-watching was severely limited.\n\nImage 1 of 2 The ONT is working now but one of these indicators was an angry red during the outage (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff) Everything looked fine here, but this is what was managing the WiFi. (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)\n\nYou can, it turns out, do a fair amount with tethered phones. All of us turned on our personal hotspots and tethered our tablets and even smart TVs to our devices. For about eight hours, this was a decent, if imperfect solution; much of the streaming was of marginal quality.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nOn day two, we all got messages from Verizon that we had used all but 10% of our hotspot allowance (we're on a family plan), and soon the system would be reducing our throughput to something approximating 3G speeds.\n\nReconnecting with an old friend\n\nWe all stopped most of our stream-based tethering and switched to good old-fashioned DVD, watching About a Boy, Casino Royale, and Collateral on my old Sony Blu-ray player. The remote, which may have purred when we picked it up for the first time in years, was non-functional. The batteries had started leaking. I replaced them, but found that most buttons would only work when pressed with herculean force.\n\nThe good news, if there was any, is that it was a weekend, so we mostly didn't have to work. In my world, though, there was the ongoing TikTok drama (almost banned, banned, sort of saved, extended). I did my best to tether my laptop and live-blog the constantly evolving news. Without broadband, it wasn't easy. Uploading images was hard. The system I was working in kept resetting, and sometimes losing my work.\n\nThis long holiday weekend also included Presidential inauguration day in the US and, whatever your political affiliation, no one likes to miss history unfolding. We could no longer stream to our big TVs, so we gathered around my iPhone 16 Pro Max, which had the best connection and largest screen to watch the ceremonies and speeches. The feed would cut out every five minutes or so, but it was more or less watchable.\n\n(Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)\n\nThroughout this ordeal, there was also general frustration with Verizon.\n\nWhen FiOS first went out, and after restarting my modem and system multiple times, I called Verizon (I tried the app, but it's a mess). That was a Friday. The support tech listened to my issue, but could not confirm any of it because it turned out I was speaking to Verizon Wireless, and they have no direct connection to Verizon FiOS. Go figure. She helpfully connected me to the FiOS people, where I repeated my issue and they told me they had no reports of a wider outage.\n\nThe tech informed me that the soonest they'd be able to get to me was Tuesday, almost four days later. I blanched, and told her as politely as I could that that was unacceptable. As is often the case, she had no power to do anything more, but offered to hand me to a supervisor who could probably expedite it and maybe get me help one day earlier. It was a holiday weekend, which I think made finding support technicians even harder.\n\nHours later I was talking to an extremely helpful Verizon FiOS supervisor, who assured me they could get someone to me on Monday.\n\nThe broadband rescue\n\nA FiOS cry for help (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)\n\nMonday came and they arrived. That's when I learned that even Verizon knew that multiple neighbors were out \u2013 why they didn't tell me this is beyond me. Even my neighbor was in the dark. I saw her outside and she asked if my network was out, I told her it was, which confirmed this was a neighborhood outage. She told me that Verizon asked her to try turning her system on and off before telling her that her neighbors also had an outage. \"So why did you ask me to turn my box on and off?\" she asked them. I told her that Verizon FiOS was finally on the job trying to troubleshoot this multi-house issue.\n\nThe technician climbed some utility poles around the neighborhood until he found one junction box that, it turned out, had been severely abused by squirrels. It took another eight hours for Verizon to fix the box, and even then they discovered a local problem in my FiOS hookup that they had to fix before my broadband returned. Multiple times the technicians asked me if anyone had been messing with my box. I promised them I never touched it.\n\nFinally, as the temperature plummeted late Monday my Wi-Fi network was flush with 600Mbps connectivity. Throughout my home smart devices sprung to life.\n\nThere are far worse things than losing connectivity for a few days, but on the list of everyday frustrations, this one gets a 10. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go yell at some squirrels.",

He has held nearly a dozen leadership roles and was named to his current role in July 2023.\n\nThe first step toward delivering a rewarding customer experience, as Higgins outlined in a blog at RetailCustomerExperience.com, is to commit to being a loyalty company \u2014 instead of a transaction company. \"If you are adept at fostering meaningful connections with your customers, they will stay with you for years. If you are great at this, they will be with you for life,\" he wrote.\n\nThe year 2024 was a busy one for Higgins' team as it launched a new CX organization, with a whole new level of service and responsiveness. As Verizon heads into 2025 he and his team are focused on AI innovations, one of which intertwines AI with human agents.\n\nTo get deeper insight on his steps to CX success, as well as what Verizon is doing with its CX strategy, RetailCustomerExperience.com reached out to Higgins via email.\n\nWhat makes a great CX\n\nQ. The retail consumer expects much more these days in terms of customer experience \u2014 what trends or substantial changes has Verizon seen in terms of what new and current customers want and needs?\n\nA. Today's consumers want companies to anticipate their wants and needs to some degree. In fact, four out of five people say they would share personal data if it made for a better experience, according to a PwC loyalty survey. And 55% said they would stop buying from a company that they otherwise liked after several bad experiences.\n\nSo, what makes a great customer experience? First, it's personalized. When a customer engages with Verizon \u2014 whether online, on the phone or in a store \u2014 they expect that we know who they are and how they've engaged with us in the past. They want us to provide them with offers and services that are specific to their needs.\n\nSecond, a great customer experience makes the customer feel good whenever they contact us. That means: resolving problems quickly, delivering upside surprises and making them feel like they and their business are valued.\n\nThink of your interactions with your local retailer, where you've shopped for years. The proprietor knows you, your likes, and dislikes, and can recommend products and services based on that knowledge. They want to keep you happy. That's what consumers expect from every company today, no matter where they shop.\n\nTech in play\n\nQ. What technologies is Verizon using to drive an enhanced customer experience and how important is embracing new technologies in CX?\n\nA. New technologies are central to an enhanced customer experience \u2014 especially GenAI.\n\nWe're using GenAI to relieve some of the cognitive load on our employees so they can focus on the customer in front of them and create a better customer experience. In the past when customers called in with complex questions, representatives often had to search through many documents to find the answer. It could be time consuming. Now, using GenAI we've created a tool called the Personal Research Assistant which helps provide employees with the information they need to answer a customer's question instantly and personalized for their unique needs. We're seeing great results so far with employees being able to answer nearly all (95%) of customer questions with almost always (96%) the correct answer.\n\nAnother tool we've created is our Personal Shopper/Problem Solver which uses GenAI to instantly analyze a customer's profile from the moment they contact us to help employees get a head start on who the customer is and why they may be calling. Since launch, this has helped reduce customer transaction time \u2014 what used to take roughly 20-25 clicks by employees now takes one to five clicks.\n\nOur application of GenAI has already improved the Verizon customer experience. It's giving us an edge and the ability to stand out in a competitive market.\n\nWhere loyalty fits in\n\nQ. How is Verizon driving customer loyalty and how critical is a strong loyal relationship for today's retailer?\n\nA. Customer loyalty is the core of any business. An unhappy customer can always go somewhere else, and it is much more expensive to gain a new customer than to retain an existing one. To keep customers happy and loyal, we work hard to provide the best network: making sure that it's fast and always working whether a customer is at home streaming a movie, or on the road, or at a concert with 90,000 other fans.\n\nBut there's a second part to loyalty, encompassing the many things we do that surround the network \u2014 billing, customer care, the in-store as well as online experience. All of these responsibilities must be delivered with excellence. Getting both the network and everything else right is the key to making customers want to be loyal.\n\nGetting personal\n\nQ. Consumers love personalization. How is Verizon responding to that want?\n\nA. Consumers want to feel that products and services are made for them. Our job is to identify \u2014 proactively when possible \u2014 what a customer is looking for and deliver it fast and consistently.\n\nWe do this by analyzing billions of data points so we can zero in on the best options for each customer.\n\nIn order to personalize our response, we try to get the best picture of a customer based on what we already know. What's their purchase history, their likes and dislikes, the devices they own, the upgrades they're eligible for and how and where they like to do business with us?\n\nThis approach allows us to offer a feature they might be looking for, or content that's relevant to them, before they even reach out to Verizon. We can also replace generic correspondence and marketing material with custom-tailored messages \u2014 what we call a \"segment of me.\"\n\nAbout Judy Mottl",

There\u2019s been an uptick of interest in unconventional sports like pickleball, and women\u2019s sports. Streaming platforms like Netflix bet big on live sports in hopes to bring in more money from advertisers. Finally, since the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) approved its name, image and likeness (NIL) policy back in 2021, the lines between influencers and athletes is becoming more blurred.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s getting more difficult for brands to stand out from one another as more advertisers flock to the space. That\u2019s true even for a brand as big as Verizon, according to Nick Kelly, Verizon\u2019s vp of partnerships. \u201cWe have to find something that we can own,\u201d Kelly told Digiday.\n\nIn this episode of the podcast, Kelly sits down with co-host Kimeko McCoy, senior marketing reporter at Digiday, to talk about its revamped sports marketing strategy, venturing into NIL deals and this year\u2019s Super Bowl plans.\n\nThis conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nStriking NIL deals\n\nFor almost a year and a half now, we were trying to figure out what is our way in that is authentic and can make a difference. We really struggled with the fact that there are a lot of brands who\u2019ve gone and sponsored women\u2019s leagues and teams. They\u2019re all doing the same thing. For us, it became more of we wanted to tell stories and empower athletes to go out there and do whatever it is that they\u2019re passionate about.\n\nPartnering with women\u2019s basketball star Paige Bueckers\n\nWe haven\u2019t necessarily been silent, but we\u2019ve been working with her team for six months now. Paige has got some big moments coming up this year. She\u2019s going to be in the NCAA tournament. She\u2019s probably going to be the number one draft pick. How do we show up in a meaningful way together as opposed to what we talked about earlier, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got an iPhone campaign. I need you to post a couple of times.\u201d\n\nThis is much more of a, \u201cI know what your roadmap looks like.\u201d This is a brand association for us and empowerment, and these are the types of people that we want to partner with. It is a slow process. I will say that Paige is unique in the fact that she has a big support system as one of the top NIL athletes in the country. But we\u2019ve also been working with a lot of local NIL athletes.\n\nMeasuring success from international stars to local athletes\n\nOur actual ability to see the value of local NIL activation is far greater than some of these national things because it is typically a very specific call to action. Our ability to track that is so much more real-time and that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting to see, for us in the summer and the fall, where we scale up the campaign locally and everywhere else, is extremely important.\n\nSuper Bowl plans\n\nWith the target being: How do I resonate in all 30 key local DMAs [designated marketing areas] in the NFL cities, we had to activate locally. That\u2019s really where we got to the point of creating Verizon Super Bowl FanFest, which is 30 simultaneous parties in 30 markets.\n\nWe can hit the loyalty play in a meaningful way on one side, and on the other, we can drive new customers.",

That applies to the assets Verizon brought to the Los Angeles area during the devastating wildfires these past couple weeks.\n\nVerizon often deploys its Tactical Humanitarian Operations Response vehicle, somewhat affectionately known as THOR, when reacting to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. But not so in LA.\n\n\u201cTHOR\u2019s not needed because the assets we have in place are doing a fantastic job,\u201d said Cory Davis, VP at Verizon Frontline. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is actually shrink our footprint, so we\u2019re not disrupting what\u2019s coming in,\u201d such as assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nGiven that fire trucks had trouble getting around after people fled for their lives \u2013 leaving stranded vehicles that had to be removed with bulldozers \u2013 Verizon decided to leave THOR at a site in Texas where other large deployable assets are being staged.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s coming in with big assets, so our goal is to reduce that footprint and cause less disruption in the response as we can,\u201d Davis told Fierce.\n\nVerizon brought plenty of smaller assets to the scene, including portable generators and temporary cell sites.\n\nThe cell sites are temporary until Verizon and others can rebuild with permanent infrastructure. Ericsson is the dominant wireless infrastructure vendor in the LA market. Verizon and T-Mobile both use Ericsson in LA. AT&T is swapping out equipment across the U.S. after deciding in 2023 to go with Ericsson\u2019s open Radio Access Network (RAN) technology and to remove Nokia, a process that is now underway and expected to be complete in 2026.\n\nMinimal disruption\n\nLike other operators, Verizon was aware of the forecast for the Santa Ana winds and started sending generators and other gear to Southern California several days before all hell broke out around January 6.\n\nAll of the major U.S. carriers were able to get their networks back up fairly quickly. An Ookla analysis of Speedtest Intelligence data shows there was a steep decline in network performance on January 8, but by January 12, wireless networks in the LA area were operating at nearly the same level they were prior to January 6.\n\nSome areas are still inaccessible for safety reasons, but Verizon by early last week had restored more than 90% of the macro cell sites that were affected by the wildfires, windstorms and public safety power shut offs, said Findlay Faubion, senior director of Network Performance at Verizon.\n\nFaubion didn\u2019t disclose how many cell sites or towers were destroyed. But he alluded to some creative solutions that Verizon\u2019s engineers devised on the fly. For example, at one beachside park command center, they discovered a macro site down the street that was still in service. Then they used (the rather rare) Verizon-owned aerial fiber to connect to a Cell on Light Truck (COLT) equipped with C-band spectrum to provide coverage in that area.\n\nHe and his team are constantly plotting where to prioritize their assets. \u201cIt\u2019s finding the right solution for that situation. Sometimes you need a microwave link, sometimes satellite backhaul is your best option,\u201d he said.\n\nMany people might be aware that T-Mobile switched on its direct-to-device satellite emergency alert service via its Starlink partnership during the wildfires. Verizon also offers a satellite-based D2D service, which is in addition to Apple\u2019s Emergency SOS for iPhone uses. Customers with select Android devices are able to send emergency text messages via Verizon\u2019s Skylo deal.\n\nAs anyone can imagine, the work takes a toll. But Davis said the Frontline team prepares for worst-case scenarios every day. And while Verizon employees are working around the clock, they\u2019re there to support firefighters and other first responders on the ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a heroic response from everybody,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey are truly putting their lives at risk, and they are doing a phenomenal job.\u201d",

Verizon stock still attracts income-oriented investors, thanks to its dividend. But a growth story has been lacking for VZ stock.\n\nAmid top management changes, the company is focusing on generating growth in wireless service revenue, free cash flow and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nFurther, VZ stock has advanced about 10% in 2025. Shares in AT&T have gained 22% while T-Mobile is up about 24%\n\nInvestors in AT&T stock are bullish on \"convergence\" \u2014 selling landline broadband and wireless services in product bundles.\n\nFrontier Acquisition On Track\n\nIn September, Verizon agreed to buy Frontier Communications (FYBR) for $20 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in early 2026.\n\nFrontier is the largest pure play fiber provider in the U.S. with 10 million home passed expected by the end of 2026. The company has 2.2 million fiber network subscribers currently across 25 states.\n\nWhat's more, Verizon has increased its fixed wireless access subscriber goal to 8 million to 9 million by the end of 2028. That's up from 4 million to 5 million 5G fixed broadband customers by the end of 2025.\n\nVerizon Stock Fundamentals\n\nRising interest rates and Treasury bill yields have been a headwind for dividend-paying stocks. Further, a Verizon stock buyback has been delayed by purchases of radio spectrum needed for 5G wireless services.\n\nNew York-based Verizon may be in a tough position as wireless industry growth slows amid competition with AT&T and T-Mobile as well as cable TV companies. The Verizon brand also has lost some oomph as the company fights to regain its marketing claim to operating the highest quality wireless network.\n\nHowever, it's taking much longer than expected for 5G synergies to kick in. Verizon owns mid-band and high-frequency millimeter wave radio spectrum.\n\nVerizon's consumer wireless business has yet to get a material revenue lift from 5G smartphone users. Also, revenue from 5G business services using private networks has disappointed.\n\nVZ Stock: No 5G Boost\n\nOverall, revenue growth remains an issue. Data-gobbling mobile video hasn't panned out as a big moneymaker. Verizon has focused on upgrading consumers to unlimited data plans to boost average monthly revenue per user.\n\nVerizon expects 5G business services using private network links to gain momentum in 2025. Also, it's investing in \"mobile-edge compute\" sites.\n\nVerizon has partnered with Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon (AMZN) to develop 5G apps for the web-connected industrial devices. Another partner is IBM (IBM).\n\nWhat's more, pundits expect 5G wireless to have a role in manufacturing automation, cloud gaming, autonomous vehicles, drones and remote health care services.\n\nVerizon Stock: Is It A Buy Right Now?\n\nWhether Verizon stock is a buy depends on fundamental and technical factors as well as each investor's own goals, strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nVerizon holds an entry point of 44.73 from a double-bottom base. The double-bottom base looks sort of like the letter W. It features two distinct sell-offs.\n\nIn addition, Verizon stock holds a Relative Strength Rating of only 73 out of a best-possible 99, according to the IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have RS ratings of 80 or better.\n\nIn addition, VZ stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 73 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. It's a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nMeanwhile, Verizon stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-plus. This rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.\n\nAs of March 4, Verizon stock trades just below its 44.73 entry point. Amid volatility in technology stocks, some investors might view Verizon as a defensive play.\n\nFurther, check out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to find dozens more of the best stocks to buy or watch.\n\nAlso, investors can sign up for email alerts on earnings and other news from Verizon investor relations.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on 5G wireless, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nHow To Use The 10-Week Moving Average For Buying And Selling\n\nGet Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report | How To Invest\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis",

There will also be a lineup of NFL legends and players in their hometowns, such as Tiki Barber, Jason Witten, Marshall Faulk, Jamaal Charles, Jason Taylor, Emmanuel Sanders, Patrick Willis, Derrick Brooks, and more.\n\nEach event will include tailgates with food prepared by local chefs. For example, in Phoenix, guests can enjoy bites from chef Stacey Weber, and in Cleveland, the menu will be provided by Rocco Whalen of the city\u2019s popular Fahrenheit restaurant. In Buffalo, N.Y., the menu will feature local favorites like beef on weck sandwiches and Buffalo wings.\n\nOther highlights include performances by the Rams Mariachi Band; the Texans Gameday Presentation Team; and DJs such as DJ Infared, Jay Ejercito, Split Second Sound, and more.\n\nStadium activities will include locker room tours and the chance to participate in combine drills, kick a field goal, play tailgate games, or enjoy the drum line. Kelly said that each experience will be an \u201cauthentic celebration tailored to the spirit of the local fandom.\u201d\n\nTicket drops began Jan. 3 and are available through verizonfanfest.com. Verizon customers can also bring a select number of guests. In less than a week, Kelly said that multiple locations sold out.\n\nAs the Official 5G Network of the NFL, Verizon will also host on-site activations in New Orleans, but those plans have yet to be revealed.",

            "content": "When it comes to stocks that can offer both income and upside, two of the world\u2019s largest telecom companies are interesting places to look. Verizon Communications NYSE: VZ and AT&T NYSE: T both have substantial dividend yields of over 5%. Additionally, both can provide the potential for capital appreciation. Based on average Wall Street price targets, both show significant upside potential in their stock prices.\n\nVerizon\u2019s implied upside comes in at over 21%, while AT&T\u2019s sits at 17%, based on Jan. 16 closing prices. If these figures come to fruition in 2025, the upside plus dividends would provide a not-too-shabby return on the year. In 2024, AT&T was the company that far and away delivered the superior combination of income and growth. The stock provided a total return of 44%. Verizon\u2019s return was 13%. However, the question remains: which company is the better buy for 2025 and beyond? I\u2019ll compare the strategies of the two firms to provide my take on this question.\n\nGet Verizon Communications alerts: Sign Up\n\nAT&T: Fiber-First Focus\n\nAT&T Today T AT&T $26.60 +0.52 (+1.97%) 52-Week Range $15.94 \u25bc $27.97 Dividend Yield 4.17% P/E Ratio 17.86 Price Target $26.74 Add to Watchlist\n\nBoth company\u2019s strategies focus largely on investing in their wireless and broadband capabilities. Wireless means mobile phone coverage. Broadband means internet connections to homes and buildings. Both have pursued investments in 5G for their wireless business. AT&T\u2019s wireless services revenue was $16.5 billion last quarter.\n\nThe main difference between the two comes in their broadband strategies. AT&T\u2019s strategy mostly revolves around fiber-optic connectivity. It now has 9 million fiber-optic customers. It also has a much smaller fixed wireless business, known as AT&T Internet Air, with around 500,000 subscribers. The difference is that fiber uses cables to connect to buildings. Fixed wireless uses towers to send internet signals.\n\nAT&T Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$26.74\n\n0.50% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 23 Analyst Ratings Current Price $26.61 High Forecast $32.00 Average Forecast $26.74 Low Forecast $18.00 AT&T Stock Forecast Details\n\nThe company\u2019s clear preference for fiber, based on the size of the customer base, is because of two beliefs it has about the future. First, the company sees the demand for high-performance broadband connectivity growing rapidly. As data transmission rises, fiber's faster speeds and lower latency will make it users' preferred choice over fixed wireless.\n\nSecond, AT&T sees fiber as the backbone of a future where broadband and wireless networks converge. In this reality, cell towers and buildings are all connected to fiber. This can maximize the speed of both broadband and wireless. It also lowers long-term operating costs and makes upgrading easy after laying the initial fiber cables. Over the past few years, AT&T has seen increasing success in converging its wireless and fiber customers. Now, 40% of fiber customers are also wireless customers.\n\nVerizon: Larger Wireless and Fixed Wireless Businesses\n\nVerizon Communications Today VZ Verizon Communications $43.66 -0.05 (-0.10%) 52-Week Range $37.59 \u25bc $47.36 Dividend Yield 6.21% P/E Ratio 10.55 Price Target $46.11 Add to Watchlist\n\nVerizon invests heavily in 5G for wireless, and its wireless service revenue was nearly $20 billion last quarter.\n\nIn broadband, it has opted for a more mixed approach between fiber and fixed wireless.\n\nThe company has 7.1 million fiber connections. It also recently announced it will acquire Frontier Communications Parent NASDAQ: FYBR.\n\nVerizon Communications Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$46.11\n\n5.60% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 19 Analyst Ratings Current Price $43.67 High Forecast $55.00 Average Forecast $46.11 Low Forecast $39.00 Verizon Communications Stock Forecast Details\n\nTogether, they have around 10 million fiber customers and approximately 25 million fiber passings. Passings refers to buildings that sit along fiber network routes and could connect. Essentially, it shows the total potential fiber customers, based on cable currently laid. AT&T's fiber passings sit at 29 million. Analysts expect that the Frontier deal will not close for over a year.\n\nVerizon also has 4.2 million fixed wireless customers. Overall, it gained 396,000 broadband customers last quarter, compared to AT&T\u2019s 28,000. However, fiber adds of 226K were more than five times higher than Verizon\u2019s 43,000. Both companies are losing a lot of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) customers. This explains the gap in total broadband and fiber adds.\n\nVerizon & AT&T: Not Mutually Exclusive\n\nOverall, there are things to like about both AT&T and Verizon. Verizon generates about $3 billion more in revenue a year, while AT&T is generating a little less than $2 billion more in free cash flow. Markets value the firms nearly identically, with around $160 billion in market capitalization. AT&T\u2019s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is around 23% higher than Verizon\u2019s. Verizon\u2019s 7% dividend yield is substantially higher than AT&T\u2019s 5% yield.\n\nAT&T\u2019s long-term fiber strategy is working significantly better than Verizon\u2019s, but Verizon also has a much larger fixed wireless business. Its overall broadband strategy is also growing much faster. In my view, both companies look like good options for income and upside. Allocations to both can allow for capitalization on different trends and changes in market sentiment. Between these two telecom giants, it doesn\u2019t have to be one or other.\n\nBefore you consider Verizon Communications, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Verizon Communications wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Verizon Communications currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Revenues are forecasted to be $35.4 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 0.8%.\n\nOver the last 30 days, there has been a downward revision of 0.5% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Verizon metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Operating revenues- Consumer' should come in at $27.29 billion.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been investors\u2019 favorites for a long time now. Over the years, these equities have performed better than the broader market. That said, when it comes to dividend investing, opinions often split down the middle between those seeking high yields and those favoring dividend growth. Though analysts recommend buying stocks with proven tracks of dividend growth, the appeal of high yields is hard to ignore. According to analysts, investors should steer clear of yield traps and focus on companies that consistently increase the value returned to shareholders. However, those advocating yields have plenty to say about the significance of dividend yields.\n\nAlso read: 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nOne such example is a report published by Newton Investment Management. According to the report, high-yield dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during high inflationary periods between 1940 and 2021. The report also revealed that investment portfolios with high-yield dividend stocks outperformed those with low or no dividends in terms of value-weighted performance. High-yield portfolios surpassed low-yield ones by 199 basis points and zero-yield portfolios by 330 basis points. While this result provides useful information, it doesn\u2019t offer details about the market conditions at the time, giving only a broad picture of high-yield stock performance. Analysts have paid close attention to how dividend stocks perform during market volatility, as the need for consistent income becomes more pronounced in such times. As a result, they suggest considering high-yield stocks only if these companies also have a strong history of dividend growth.\n\nDan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, made the following comment about extremely high yields in the firm\u2019s recent report:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really critical to be selective when it comes to buying dividend-paying stocks and chasing yield. Looking for the most yield-rich areas of the market can often lead you into troubled areas and dividend traps\u2014companies that have a nice-looking yield that is ultimately unsustainable. You have to screen for dividend durability and reliability going forward.\u201d\n\nThat said, high yields aren\u2019t automatically a bad sign. In fact, dividend yield plays an important role when investing in dividend stocks, as it shows how much income an investor can expect relative to the stock\u2019s price. However, to fully benefit from high yields, other factors like the company\u2019s cash flow, payout ratio, and dividend growth must also be considered. If these metrics are strong, high-yield stocks can still be appealing. Some reports have pointed out the long-term advantages of high-yield stocks, noting that as dividend yields increase, returns generally rise, and risk decreases. Hartford Funds conducted research factoring in annualized standard deviation, which measures a portfolio\u2019s return volatility, with a higher standard deviation indicating greater historical risk. The report found that from December 1969 to March 2024, high-dividend portfolios delivered an annualized return of 12.3%, mid-dividend portfolios 10.5%, and low-dividend portfolios 9.7%. The annualized standard deviations for these portfolios were 14.1%, 16%, and 20.8%, respectively.\n\nThe ideal situation would be when dividend growth and high yields go hand in hand, as many companies have demonstrated that this is achievable. With that being said, we will now take a look at some of the best dividend stocks with high yields to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks that have yields above 4%, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge fund investors having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nDividend Yield as of January 20: 6.99%\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) ranks seventh on our list of the best dividend stocks. The American multinational telecommunications company plays a significant role in advancing the AI sector through its 5G wireless network, which provides the speed and security needed to bring AI to edge devices like laptops and smartphones. One example of the company\u2019s involvement in AI edge computing is its collaboration with Nvidia to deliver AI capabilities to private networks, which are tailored wireless services for specific organizations. For example, Verizon is set to provide a private network for FIFA during the 2026 Men\u2019s World Cup.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) saw a 0.9% increase in consumer revenue compared to the prior year, while business revenue declined by 2.1%, leading to an overall revenue growth of 0.3%. The recovery in the consumer segment was driven by targeted incentives, marketing efforts, and the effective implementation of strategic initiatives, including recent acquisitions. Third Point Management made the following comment about VZ in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka \u201cwireless cable\u201d) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing\u2019s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper\u2019s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.\u201d\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has been a solid dividend payer because of its stable cash position. In the first nine months of the year, the company reported an operating cash flow of $26.5 billion and a free cash flow of $14.5 billion. It has also been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 18 consecutive years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.99%, as of January 20.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was a part of 57 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes owned by these funds have a consolidated value of over $3.2 billion. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall VZ ranks 7th on our list of the best high-yield dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential for VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "What is the best internet provider in Syracuse?\n\nCNET recommends Verizon Fios as the top internet service provider option in Syracuse. If Verizon Fios isn\u2019t available at your address, Spectrum is another solid option. Spectrum provides fast and reliable internet but does come with a notable price increase after the first year. Plans start at $40 per month and go up to $70 for the gig plan.\n\nT-Mobile is an additional alternative, with a price lock as long as you stay subscribed, though its wireless connection may be more susceptible to network congestion compared with Spectrum or Verizon. You can also get a good discount when you pair it with a mobile plan.\n\nBest internet in Syracuse, New York\n\nIf Verizon Fios is available in a city, there\u2019s a good chance it'll be our top pick for internet there, and Syracuse is no different. Even if you can\u2019t get Verizon at your address, you\u2019ll likely have at least one good option. According to Federal Communications Commission data, 100% of households in Syracuse have access to download speeds of 100 megabits per second and 10Mbps upload.\n\nSyracuse internet providers compared Provider Internet technology Monthly price range Speed range Monthly equipment costs Data cap Contract CNET review score Spectrum\n\nRead full review Cable $40-$70 500-1,000Mbps $10 (optional) None None 7.2 T-Mobile Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$55 with eligible mobile plans) 87-415Mbps None None None 7.4 Verizon Fios\n\nRead full review Fiber $50-$90 (with autopay discount) 300-940Mbps None None None 7.6 Verizon 5G Home Internet\n\nRead full review Fixed wireless $50-$70 ($35-$45 with eligible phone plan) 50-1,000Mbps None None None 7.2 Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data\n\nOther available internet providers in Syracuse\n\nMany cities have a few local internet providers to consider in addition to the nationwide ISPs. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t many other options available in Syracuse. Here is everything else you can get in the city:\n\nSatellite internet : We typically only recommend satellite internet when you can\u2019t get anything else, and this rule holds true for Syracuse. HughesNet and Viasat both offer service to 100% of the city, but like all satellite providers, they come with high prices, low data caps and slow speeds. Starlink is a faster satellite option, but equipment costs $349 upfront and plans start at $120 a month.\n\n: We typically only recommend satellite internet when you can\u2019t get anything else, and this rule holds true for Syracuse.

Verizon 5G Home Internet: Like T-Mobile Home Internet, Verizon uses its 5G network for home internet in Syracuse. You can get speeds of 300/10Mbps for $50 per month or 1,000/50 for $70 in some areas. There are no equipment fees or data caps on either plan.\n\nCheap internet options in Syracuse\n\nStarting prices for internet in Syracuse average $45 per month, which is slightly higher than nearby Albany ($43). Low-income households in Syracuse also have the option of using Spectrum\u2019s Internet Assist plan, which gets you 50Mbps for $25 a month.\n\nWhat\u2019s the cheapest internet plan in Syracuse?

Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers.\n\nSyracuse internet providers such as Spectrum may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Many, including Verizon Fios and T-Mobile, run the same standard pricing year-round.\n\nFor a more extensive list of deals, check out our guide on the best internet deals.\n\nHow fast is Syracuse broadband?\n\nThere are three internet plans offering gig speeds in Syracuse -- right around average for a city of its size. There aren\u2019t any ultra-fast plans above 1,000Mbps, most households will be fine with the speeds available. Verizon Fios is the only provider that offers symmetrical speeds in Syracuse.\n\nFastest internet plans in Syracuse Provider Max download speed Max upload speed Starting price Data cap Contract Spectrum Internet Gig\n\nRead full review 1,000Mbps 35Mbps $70 ($100 after one year) None None Verizon 5G Home Plus Internet\n\nRead full review 1,000Mbps 50Mbps $70 ($45 with qualifying Verizon 5G mobile plans) None None Verizon Fios 1 Gig\n\nRead full review 940Mbps 911Mbps $90 None None Show more (0 item) Shop providers at my address\n\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data\n\nWhat\u2019s a good internet speed?\n\nMost internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming simultaneously.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming simultaneously.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Syracuse\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nThe answer to those questions is often layered and complex, but the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When it comes to selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and also take into account real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the final word on internet providers in Syracuse?\n\nThere\u2019s a clear winner when it comes to internet in Syracuse. Verizon Fios offers the fastest speeds, the best value and it has the happiest customers. No matter where you live in the country, if Verizon Fios is available, it\u2019s almost always the best choice. If you can\u2019t get Fios, Spectrum and T-Mobile are both worthy backup options, but they each come with noteworthy drawbacks -- hefty price increases for Spectrum and lower speeds for T-Mobile.\n\nInternet providers in Syracuse FAQs\n\nWho is the cheapest internet provider in Syracuse? Spectrum, T-Mobile, Verizon Fios and Verizon 5G offer plans starting at $50 ($40 by Spectrum currently), the cheapest options in Syracuse.\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Syracuse? Verizon Fios is the best internet provider for most people in Syracuse. It has symmetrical speeds up to 940Mbps, no contracts and unlimited data on all plans. T-Mobile Home Internet is another good option, with download speeds up to 415Mbps and no data caps. Spectrum\u2019s cable internet plans are available almost everywhere in the city, but you\u2019ll end up paying a lot once the promotional discounts expire after one or two years.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Syracuse? Yes, fiber internet is available in Syracuse. Verizon Fios offers fiber internet in the city with no contracts or data caps and speeds up to 940/911Mbps.",

When it comes to the best kids's smartwatch, there's a lot of choice, including kid-specific watches designed for smaller wrists with specific feature sets.\n\nAlong with design, you'll want to consider features like privacy, durability, and cost. I have put together this guide of the best kids smartwatches. The Garmin Bounce is my favorite, easily the best kids' smartwatch. But there are other options worth considering, too.\n\nIt's worth nothing that you don't want to just get any cheap Android smartwatch for a child. While those can work for some kids, especially older ones, the best Android smartwatches for kids have safety features that make them a better option.\n\nNamerah Saud Fatmi Senior Editor \u2014 Accessories Namerah enjoys geeking out over accessories, gadgets, and all sorts of smart knickknacks.

Find out more about how we test.\n\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\n\nMy son has used a lot of kids smartwatches and the Garmin Bounce is always the one he prefers. Setup couldn't be any easier: just download the Garmin Jr. app and pair the watch with a Garmin parents account. Everything can be managed through the Garmin Jr. app, including contacts, alarms and timers, geofencing, real-time location tracking, and text and voice messaging.\n\nGarmin's app also includes cool activities and games for kids to play alongside parents, including plenty of educational games that encourage kids to get outside and do something active. The watch has a built-in step tracker and can also track sleep, so you'll only need to take it off to charge \u2014 or if it gets uncomfortable after wearing it for a while.\n\nGarmin Bounce is weatherproof and is even swim-friendly, so you don't have to worry about your child breaking it under even normal kid conditions.\n\nThe watch itself is a great size that even fits an eight-year-old's wrist and is light enough to be comfortable all day. The two-to-three-day battery life is impressive: I've found that we only have to charge the watch twice a week or so with normal use. It has both Wi-Fi and LTE connectivity so it can save battery when you're at home or another familiar place, all of which is configurable through the Garmin Jr. app.\n\nGarmin manages its own LTE network connectivity through the Garmin Kids Smartwatch subscription plan which runs $10 per month. This one can't be combined with your phone bill and doesn't need to be managed at all, so a simple subscription is all it takes to ensure that your child can be connected no matter where they are. Garmin has an LTE coverage map to help you ensure this service is right for you.\n\nFor me, my favorite thing about this watch is just how darn easy it is to use. There's nothing complicated about setup or management and the Garmin Jr. app is very well-designed. Settings aren't hidden and the watch itself is packed with fun games and activities that are enough to keep kids interested during light downtime but not enough to distract them from school or other important activities.\n\nPlus, it even has a school mode, do not disturb mode, and other similar ways to configure the watch so it's a helpful tool and not a burden. There's nothing like seeing them go off and do their chores every day at the right time because the watch lets them know it's time.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Garmin Bounce scorecard Attribute Quick look Score Display & design Lightweight and comfortable for children \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Software & performance Extensive parental controls and features like LTE and geofencing \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Price Very amicable pricing but subscription required \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Battery life Great two-to-four-day uptime \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Health & fitness Loads of activities and sports can be tracked \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBest for young kids\n\n(Image credit: MyFirst)\n\n2. MyFirst Fone R2 Best for young kids Our expert review: Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Reasons to buy + One-touch SOS feature with live recordings + Precise GPS location tracking + geofencing option + Pedometer and goal settings + Voice and video calling available Reasons to avoid - Only two-day battery life - Just splash-proof\n\nThe MyFirst Fone R2 is a simpler option that will give parents of young ones peace of mind with connectivity and useful tracking, and please littles with some cool features. Connecting via the 4G network, kids can make and receive voice memos and calls with a single button push on the watch itself.\n\nThere's a useful one-touch SOS mode kids can activate if they're in trouble or don't feel safe. Once pressed, parents will receive an emergency location alert and a 30-second live recording of the surrounding sounds. I am certain parents will find this reassuring.\n\nSpeaking of location, this watch uses advanced GPS, Wi-Fi, and GSM to help provide a precise location for tracking lost kids. You can also set boundaries so you receive a notification if the child moves beyond 200 meters from a defined area like your property or the local park or school grounds. It can also track indoor locations using surrounding Wi-Fi signals, up to an accuracy of 10 meters. This can be useful if you've lost your child in a department store or shopping mall, for example.\n\nFor calls, kids can make and receive calls from the watch, functioning just like a smartphone. You can converse in real-time with your little one as they walk home from school, for example.\n\nThis isn't just a safety watch, though. It functions as a pedometer, counting kids' steps. Kids can also set goals in the app and work towards them. The fitness aspect is secondary here, though, which is why I believe this smartwatch is ideal for younger kids, even though it's rated for ages five through 12.\n\nCompatible with both iOS and Android devices, the smartwatch also has a built-in 5MP HD camera so kids can capture fun moments to share with you later. They can also connect with friends with the neat Shake-to-make-friends feature. Once near another MyFirst Fone R2, kids can shake the device to automatically pair with their new friend. Once paired, the kids can make and receive calls from one another and send fun emojis.\n\nDon't worry about distractions because a Class Mode silences the watch during certain times of the day, including school hours. When in this mode, only the SOS functions can be used.\n\nEquipped with a 1.3-inch AMOLED touch screen, the watch is splash-proof and only lasts for up to two days per charge, so be prepared to recharge several nights per week. You can also recharge each night since there's no sleep tracking or other advanced features.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally MyFirst Fone R2 scorecard Attribute Quick look Score Display & design Intuitive, bright, and colorful design attracts kids \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Software & performance Basically a smartphone with parental controls \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Price On the expensive side, with cheap subscription plan as well \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Battery life Two-day battery life is so-so \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Health & fitness Kids can set goals, track health and also fitness metrics \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBest for photography\n\n(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)\n\n3. TickTalk 4 Best for budding photographers Our expert review: Average Amazon review: \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 \u2606 Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Step tracking + Much improved battery life over TickTalk 3 + Dedicated GPS for location tracking + iHeartRadio Family is included + The display is much better than the previous version + Secure calling and messaging Reasons to avoid - Still no geofencing - The watch is really thick - Location reporting can still be hit or miss\n\nWhen the TickTalk 3 was on this list, it was a good watch but missing some essential features. With the TickTalk 4, many were resolved. The newest version of the kid's smartwatch fixed one of the most significant issues I had with the TickTalk 3: poor battery life. In the design overhaul, more space was made for a larger battery, additional cellular antennas, and software changes helped extend the battery life to a full day without issue.\n\nThe TickTalk 4 also adds another camera, so your child can take photos of things instead of only being able to use the selfie camera. You'll also find dedicated GPS paired with Wi-Fi and cellular data for better location monitoring.\n\nStep tracking has been included to make being active more fun, along with free iHeartRadio Family, which was my favorite feature during my TickTalk 4 review, because kids can stream family-friendly music while playing. The watch works with GSM cellular carriers \u2014 so it won't work on Verizon \u2014 and the company has partnered with the prepaid carrier Red Pocket Mobile for service if you choose.\n\nAll of this is kept secure in a very well-designed and easy-to-use parental companion app. The watch can only communicate with contacts that you add. This includes messaging, calling, SOS contacts, and video chats. The watch design is a bit on the bulky side, but it is very durable and customized with what the company calls \"Chums.\" These are rubber icons like rainbows, guitars, skateboards, and more that tack onto the watch strap.\n\nThis one doesn't feature geofencing, though, which knocks it down a peg on our best kids Android smartwatches list. It's also got some issues with accurate and timely location reporting, which isn't super great when you need that important feature.\n\nNote that the TickTalk 5 has recently been released with enhanced cellular reception, an upgraded GPS system, improved strap material, more compact and lightweight design, enhanced waterproof features, and improved battery efficiency. We haven't had the chance to test this new model yet, but you'll be pleased with either option.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally TickTalk 4 scorecard Attribute Quick look Score Display & design Comes in splashy colors but bulky on the wrist \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Software & performance Cameras help this kids' wearable stand out \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Price Good pricing, same as Garmin Bounce \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Battery life Generous two to four days of battery life \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Health & fitness Not much beside step tracking \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nBest Samsung\n\n(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)\n\nSamsung might not make a \"proper\" kids watch but the Galaxy Watch 4 (40mm) is going to be your best bet if you're looking to get something more full-featured for your kids. Since it runs almost the latest Wear OS 4, it has a metric ton of apps and other features that dwarf all other watches offered here. Despite being such an old model, I still use my Watch 4 on and off.\n\nLike other Wear OS watches, the Galaxy Watch 4 supports full watch face customization, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and LTE connection as well as GPS location and full messaging and phone calling features. You can even have them pair their earbuds with the watch and listen to music on your favorite music service. It's also simple to add to your existing phone plan since it supports all major networks and has an eSIM built right in, so long as you opt for the more expensive LTE model, of course.\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 4 has full weatherproofing and can be taken swimming, used for sleep tracking, and just about anything else you can possibly think of. Fitness tracking with it is wonderful and it's got all the important health-related features that you could want including heart rate tracking and many different health sensors on the underside.\n\nBeing a \"proper\" smartwatch also means that it looks like an actual watch and not a kid-friendly device. The obvious downside here is that this watch isn't built for kids. In short, that means your kids are going to have to treat it like a nice, expensive electronic device. If you have kids who are wild or generally careless, expect it to get broken pretty quickly.\n\nIf nothing, make sure to add a great Galaxy Watch 4 screen protector or case to keep it safe like the Spigen Ultra Hybrid Screen Protector, which wraps around the entire body of the watch and helps keep it safe.\n\nSince this is a standard smartwatch, you won't find any parental controls that can be downloaded. Sure, you could use the Galaxy Watch app to manage the watch remotely and even track the location with tools that Google and Samsung provide, but things like geofencing or app store restrictions just aren't available since it's not designed with this express purpose in mind.\n\nYou'll also have to consider battery life, which isn't as good as the other kids' watches on this list. This one is meant to do everything, not last a long time. If you absolutely must get your child a Samsung watch, the smaller 40mm version of the Galaxy Watch 4 is the best Samsung smartwatch for kids.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 scorecard Attribute Quick look Score Display & design Lightweight with universal straps \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Software & performance Wear OS is fantastic but lacks parental controls \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Price Cost-effective with no additional subscriptions required \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Battery life Mediocre compared to other kids' wearables \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Health & fitness Excellent health and fitness tracking \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBest on Verizon\n\n(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)\n\n5. GizmoWatch 2 Best on Verizon Our expert review: Today's Best Deals $99 at Verizon Reasons to buy + Good call quality + Watch software is easy to use + Great safety features Reasons to avoid - Missing a Do Not Disturb mode - Locked to Verizon - No Wi-Fi\n\nThe GizmoWatch 2 from Verizon is a great watch that gets a lot of things right. If your family uses Verizon for coverage, this is probably the best kids' smartwatch to get because it uses the same Verizon network as your phones. Just be aware that, since this is a Verizon-branded watch, it only works with Verizon's network.\n\nAs far as the watch itself is concerned, you'll get to choose from two colors \u2014 blue or pink \u2014 and it has a durable squarish plastic case. There are two buttons on the side to offer a few actions when pressed. One action, for example, is that if either button is pressed, the parent-designated emergency contact is called.\n\nThe screen on the watch is vibrant and gets bright enough to be visible in most lighting conditions. Your child can select from seven different colorful themes to give their watch a bit of personality. There's also a fun jumping game and step tracker for the kids to earn rewards from that you can set in the parent's app.\n\nFrom the parents' side, through the GizmoHub, which acts as a companion app, you can control nearly every aspect of your child's watch. This is also where you get to set up who the watch can call, be called, or message. There's no camera, but your child can make standard phone calls and send preset messages, emojis, or voice messages.\n\nThe Gizmowatch 2 has built-in GPS, which can locate the watch and set up geofences. Doing so will send you a notification when the watch leaves the designated area. Your child can manually ping you their location from the watch, or you can always check in from the app.\n\nWhile a lot is going for the watch, during our GizmoWatch 2 review period, we did find that it has downfalls. Aside from being locked to Verizon, the other main feature lacking from the GizmoWatch 2 is Wi-Fi.

On the surface, the watch has a more mature design, but not so much that younger kids wouldn't enjoy it. The display is sharp and easy to read, and navigating the watch's interface is smooth and responsive.\n\nA unique feature of the Adventurer is the inclusion of a heart rate monitor. You'll be able to check on your child's activity by seeing how many steps they're taking and a history of their heart rate measurements, all from the well-designed Spacetalk companion app. Even with all the heart rate tracking, the Adventurer gets excellent battery life and is able to make it through a typical day of use easily.\n\nIt is disappointing that at this time, even though there is a front-facing camera, there is no option for video calling. Though not a major issue, messaging on the Spacetalk Adventurer can be a bit confusing because there are two messaging apps. During my review period, I'd carry on the same conversation in both apps \u2014 making it challenging to keep it all straight. Again, not a deal-breaker, but worth noting.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Spacetalk Adventurer scorecard Attribute Quick look Score Display & design Durable build quality and looks cool \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Software & performance No calls and lacks Wi-Fi connectivity \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Price It doesn't get more affordable than this \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Battery life Lasts for a day and a half to two on average \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Health & fitness Spectacular health and fitness metrics \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBest fitness band\n\n(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)\n\nGarmin makes some of the most impressive fitness smartwatches on the market today, and not to leave the kids out of the fun, Garmin has the Vivofit Jr. line of fitness bands. The newest in that family is the Vivofit Jr. 3, and it has some great features for little ones.\n\nKids join the rest of the family in friendly challenges to encourage them to be more active. There's even the ability to sync with nearby friends for a bit of fun competition as well. By getting at least 60 minutes of activity in a day, your child can earn points that translate into in a fun game that's in the companion app on your phone.\n\nThe game is themed to match the fitness band itself. When we reviewed the Vivofit Jr 3, my son loved the games for his Marvel's Black Panther-themed track. But there's also Iron Man, Disney Princesses, Little Mermaid, and some Garmin designs of Digi Camo, Lilac Floral, The Mandalorian, Baby Grogu, or Blue Stars.\n\nThe device's battery lasts up to a year and is replaceable, so you never have to charge it. You can also set reminders on the Vivofit Jr. 3 for your child to earn digital coins to redeem for rewards that you set within your companion app.\n\nThe Vivofit Jr. 3 is water-resistant to 5 ATM, tracks steps, and can track sleep automatically. While this device may not have the full gamut of features found in the TickTalk 4 or the GizmoWatch 2, it is still a fun way for your child to get active and be responsible.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Garmin Vivofit Jr. 3 scorecard Attribute Quick look Score Display & design Fun design and bright but small screen \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Software & performance Slightly problematic software with limitations \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Price Bottom-of-the-barrel pricing \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Battery life Unbeatable year-long battery life \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Health & fitness Very focused on fitness and wellness \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBest for T-Mobile\n\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\n\n8. T-Mobile SyncUp Kids Watch Best for T-Mobile Our expert review: Today's Best Deals Check Amazon $174 at T-Mobile Reasons to buy + Lightweight and comfortable to wear + Offers decent battery life + Durable design + Voice and video calling options + Geofencing capabilities Reasons to avoid - No Wi-Fi connectivity - Only limited to T-Mobile - The app can be slightly confusing\n\nFor T-Mobile customers, the T-Mobile SyncUP Kids Watch is a solid option worth considering. Available in black with two watch bands in the box, the latest updated version fixes issues we had with the original iteration back in 2021, including adding video calling and a scheduled school mode. It doesn't, however, have Wi-Fi so you're locked to the T-Mobile plan with this one, and require a subscription.\n\nIn his review, Nicholas Sutrich found that video calling worked really well, but it all depends on the strength of the signal where your child is, of course. There's also the option for SMS messages, but kids can only contact approved contacts in their contact list.\n\nThick and square in design, this watch is pretty durable, too. But Sutrich notes that the plastic display can scratch easily, so you'll want to invest in a screen protector for active little ones. The watch is also IP68 water and dust resistant and even has a built-in water ejection function kids can use after their shower or dip in the pool.\n\nWith a touch screen and side button, there's a nice, tactile feel to using this smartwatch. The Velcro strap is also a nice option: Sutrich's son preferred it over the rubberized band that's also included in the package (though you'll probably want to swap to the rubberized one for swimming or beach days). It's compatible with standard 20mm bands, so you can upgrade to whatever you choose.\n\nEquipped with a 1.4-inch screen, the T-Mobile SyncUP works on the carrier's 4G LTE network. It runs for about two days per charge with normal use. If you add a ton of messaging and enjoy some of the built-in games, it might last for less. But if the battery reaches 20 percent, the games will automatically shut off so your child prioritizes communications over fun, until they get home, at least.\n\nThe companion app is great for parents who want to keep an eye on their kids activity, including step counts, set step goals, and more. There's even options to create alarms and tasks, like chores and homework. Once completed, parents can send a reward message to their kids, cheering them on for a job well done.\n\nThe watch supports geofencing so you can set it such that you receive a notification if your child leaves an approved area. There's also live location tracking via built-in GPS.\n\nFor fun, alongside games, including Tic Tac Toe and Dino Run, there's also a built-in camera kids can use to take silly pics with friends, even sending them as messages. A calculator can provide some homework assistance.\n\nOur only issue with this watch is that we wish it had Wi-Fi to compensate for those times when a strong cellular signal isn't available. Beyond that, however, the watch is a nice option for kids of all ages.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally T-Mobile SyncUp Kids Watch scorecard Attribute Quick look Score Display & design Durable, lightweight and comfortable \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Software & performance Holistic experience for both parents and children \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Price Mid-range pricing with cheap installment plan \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Battery life Easily delivers two days of screen time \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Health & fitness Step counting but not much else \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nBest Fitbit for kids\n\n(Image credit: Fitbit)\n\nThe Fitbit Ace 3 has been the latest fitness tracker for kids from the brand, introduced way back in March 2021. But the Fitbit Ace LTE is the first from the brand that comes in a smartwatch form factor and, most notably, with LTE connectivity. It sports some marked differenced when compared to the Fitbit Ace 3.\n\nWith a plan, which is $9.99 per month or $120 per year, kids get 4G LTE cellular connectivity using the included SIM card. The purchase comes with a band that interacts with the watch itself, and you get a new one each year as you renew. Kids can use the built-in speaker and mic to make and receive calls from up to 20 contacts.\n\nGPS location tracking means you can always keep an eye on your kids' location in real-time.\n\nThe watch itself comes in Spicy Pebble or Mild Pebble, the former with a Moovin' Band and the latter with the Strange Arcade band. It's made of plastic, stainless steel, and glass and resembles a standard square-faced smartwatch. It's scratch, bump, and water-resistant (5ATM) with a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Color OLED screen so kids can go about their usual active daily lifestyles without worry. Yes, they can even go for a swim. It comes with a protective bumper case.\n\nCompatible with both Android and iOS devices, one downside is that the watch only lasts for 16 hours per charge. This means you'll need to recharge each night, but you aren't missing out since it doesn't offer sleep tracking anyway. That's a pretty glaring omission since Fitbit is known for its reliable sleep tracking. In fact, that's one of the features I love the most about the Fitbit Ace 3, being able to know when my son actually went to sleep and if he had a good night's sleep.\n\nThe Fitbit Ace LTE does, however, include heart rate tracking, a useful feature though arguably not as useful as sleep tracking.\n\nThe standout feature here is the gamification of this watch. It affords kids access to the Fitbit Arcade with tons of interactive 3D games that use haptics, sounds, and the accelerometer. Kids are rewarded when they engage in physical activity, so they can only unlock new levels and keep playing if they get up and move. There's also a School Time option that limits play during school hours.\n\nAs is customary with Fitbit, the Fitbit Ace LTE focuses on health, wellness, and fitness more so than others. There's a Noodle activity ring, for example, that records daily movements. A fun animation appears when they achieve a Move Goal, which typically requires at least an hour of physical activity daily, as per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations.\n\nThen, there's Eejie, Fitbit's modern interpretation of the Tamagotchi from the '90s. Kids nurture this character, keeping it happy by meeting their move goals. They earn items for Eejie, from clothing to cool things for its home in Bit Valley.\n\nOlder kids can make use of features like Tap to Pay if parents connect their own debit or credit card to the watch via the app. Parents get real-time notifications whenever the child makes a purchase.\n\nThe Fitbit Ace LTE is a compelling option, though it's a bit confusing in terms of what age is ideal for this smartwatch. Younger kids will love the Arcade and Eejie, and older kids will love the Tap to Pay. But nowadays, kids are getting smartphones at younger and younger ages, so this watch sits in a weird spot. It's likely best for kids aged 8-10, before they are old enough for a smartphone but when they're old enough to get some independence. As your kids get older, you might want to consider one of the best Fitbits instead of this kid-specific one.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Fitbit Ace LTE scorecard Attribute Quick look Score Display & design Fun colorways with matching themes \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Software & performance Interactive and child-centric with parental controls \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Price Quite expensive for a kids' accessory \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Battery life Okay battery that lasts only 16 hours \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Health & fitness Plenty of encouraging fitness and health features \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nOther products we tested\n\n(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)\n\nWe have tried and tested several different kids' smartwatches here at Android Central. One of our past favorites was the Gabb Watch 3, an affordable and beautifully simple LTE smartwatch for kids. Unfortunately, that model has since been discontinued. Gabb has replaced it with the newer Gabb Watch 3e, which is almost the same watch but with a few software improvements. It's still a great watch for kids, but our top selections are just a bit better than it. So while it's not ranked, it definitely deserves an honorable mention in this roundup.\n\nThe $150 smartwatch is regularly on sale for about $100, but you need to buy a cell plan for it via Gabb separately. The plans are super cheap, starting from $12.99 per month for the two-year contract. It sucks that you can only buy plans from Gabb Wireless, which is what makes it a little harder to recommend.\n\nGabb Watch 3e View at Amazon Simplest to use We loved the Gabb Watch 3 for its simplicity and easy-to-use interface. The Gabb Watch 3e is just as straightforward and easy to use. You get an IP68 water and dust-proof rating, a generous 500mAh battery, Gorilla Glass 3 and a 1.41-inch color screen, as well as 20mm interchangeable watch bands.\n\nHow to choose the best kids' smartwatch\n\nIf you are looking for a watch your child will enjoy using, that will also give you some peace of mind, you can't go wrong with the Garmin Bounce. It is the best Android smartwatch for kids who don't need a super-full-featured smartwatch. It's simple to set up, easy to manage, and connects to Garmin's managed LTE network throughout the world with a $10/month subscription. But don't think that simple means it's got nothing going on; this one packs in real-time GPS location and geofencing, great games to keep kids educated and entertained, alarms and timers, activity and sleep tracking, and so much more.\n\nIf you want something with all the extra features and then some, the TickTalk 4 is the best bet for you and your child. It's a well-built piece of technology with its own style and has some wonderful features. Since it has a SIM card in addition to Wi-Fi connectivity, you and your child will be able to communicate as needed. You will also benefit from creating GPS location tracking and location history to monitor your child's location. While the device isn't cheap, it is a great all-in-one communication device for your child that will be much harder to lose than a phone.\n\nThere could be some refinements, such as it would be helpful if there was a keyboard on the watch. Though tiny, it would be useful in situations where the canned responses weren't enough and voice dictation is inappropriate. While it would be nice to see geofencing added in, there are so many other great features like the dual-camera setup and iHeartRadio Family streaming. So, if you want to ensure your child is where they should be and be able to talk to them, there are options for that.\n\nThe Fitbit Ace LTE is the latest smartwatch for kids on this list. While it suffers from a bit of an identity crisis in terms of whether it's best for young kids or pre-teens, it has compelling features that kids in both age groups would love.\n\nBut most importantly, it has safety and communication features that parents will love. If you have a Fitbit, you can manage everything through your single Google account and keep on top of your child's location, activity, and more. Just be prepared to pay for the subscription for 4G LTE connectivity. I just wish it had sleep tracking, too.\n\nIt's a shame that Fitbit removed competitions from its app as well, so you can't compete with your kids. But older kids will love being able to pay for items from their wrist, like school lunches or items at the convenience store once this feature is available.\n\nMost importantly, talk to your kids about the responsibility that a kids' smartwatch affords. It means you're giving them some autonomy, trusting them to do the right thing, like call home in case of emergency or reach out as needed.\n\nParents struggle with the decision of if and when to get their kids a smartphone, so a device like a connected kids' smartwatch is a great transitional device. Do the kids responsibly call or text before they're leaving school and again when they get home? Do they stay within geofenced boundaries when playing outside with the neighboring kids? Are they responsible with their allowance and don't overspend? Are they handling their chores and marking them off as needed? And are they getting enough physical activity.\n\nSeeing how a child handles having a smartwatch is a great way to gauge if and when they might be ready for something more involved, like a smartphone. For parents, meanwhile, who are adamant that their kids won't be getting a smartphone until they're in high school, a smartwatch like one of these models is a great compromise.\n\nHow we test\n\nWhy you can trust Android Central \u2611\ufe0f One of the oldest and most trusted Android sites on the web\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 15 years of product testing\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Thousands of products reviewed and tested since 2007\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Dozens of smartwatches, fitness trackers, and smart rings tested every year by our team\n\nWe here at Android Central test hundreds of wearables each year. When it comes to kids' smartwatches, there aren't as many models released throughout the year as your average Wear OS smartwatch. Still, our team reviews and tests at least 15 to 20 smartwatches designed for children.\n\nOur testing is extremely practical and designed to test the product as the makers intend and advertise them to be used. Since many of us are parents, this has made it even more easier for us to gauge the usefulness, durability, and reliability of smartwatches for children. Our editors' kids vary in age, making our tests even more accurate. So you can rely on us when we recommend a smartwatch for your children.",

(You don\u2019t get T:Mobile or Verizon branded iPhones, for example.) To confuse matters even further, some phones are locked when sold, but are unlocked at a later date when the owner finishes paying off the contract.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s relatively easy to find out if your iPhone is locked or unlocked, and in this article, we\u2019re going to show you how.\n\nIf you want to find out how to unlock your iPhone so you can use it with another network read: How to unlock an iPhone.\n\nHow to check if an iPhone is unlocked in Settings\n\nScreenshot Foundry\n\nThere\u2019s an easy way to check if an iPhone is locked or unlocked using the Settings app.\n\nHere\u2019s how to access information about whether an iPhone is locked to a Network Provider. (This information has been available in iOS since iOS 14 arrived in 2020).\n\nTo access it open Settings. Tab on General. Tap About. Swipe down to Network Provider Lock. If the iPhone is unlocked, it should say that there.\n\nHow to check if an iPhone is unlocked using a SIM card\n\nSince the iPhone 14 arrived in 2022, all iPhones sold in the U.S. come with dual eSim and no sim tray. So, if the phone you are concerned with doesn\u2019t have a sim tray you\u2019ll need to skip to the next section.\n\nIf the phone you are concerned with predates the iPhone 13, the quickest way to check if it is unlocked is to simply try inserting a SIM from a different carrier. If a friend uses another network then ask them if you can borrow the SIM for a couple of minutes. Follow these steps to check that the iPhone is unlocked:\n\nPower off the iPhone. Use the SIM-card ejector tool (or a paper clip) to eject the SIM card from the iPhone. Insert your new SIM card. Press the Sleep/Wake button to wake up the iPhone. If you see a message along the lines of, \u2018The SIM card inserted in this iPhone does not appear to be supported. Only compatible SIM cards from a supported network provider may be used to activate iPhone. Please insert the SIM card that came with your iPhone or visit a supported network provider\u2019s shop\u2019, then the device is locked.\n\nIt\u2019s not such a quick solution \u2013 as it may take a while for the carrier to get back to you \u2013 but if you need to know for sure then it may be worth getting in touch with the network provider you\u2019ve signed up to and seeing if they can help. Many carriers can check for you if you provide a handset\u2019s IMEI.\n\nUse an online IMEI checker\n\nYou know how to find your IMEI, right? Once you\u2019ve got that code, you can go to one of the many IMEI-checking tools online and find out if the handset it\u2019s assigned to is locked or unlocked. The problem is that most of these services ask for a payment (although generally just a nominal amount).\n\nThere are free services too: you could try IMEI24.com, which appears legit and has been recommended by others. We must stress, however, that we don\u2019t know the company and cannot vouch for its services.\n\nGet your iPhone unlocked\n\nWe have a separate tutorial about How to unlock an iPhone.\n\nYou can sometimes get a carrier to unlock an iPhone by calling them.\n\nYou could also try a third-party unlocking service such as:\n\nDoctor SIM, promises to refund you if the unlock is unsuccessful.

            "content": "I have been slowly buying shares of Verizon (VZ -0.32%) over the past few years. The big draw for me is the telecom giant's big-time dividend. At the current share price, it yields over 7%. That's several times higher than the S&P 500's average 1.2% yield.\n\nIn addition to that lucrative income stream, I think Verizon has a lot of upside potential due to its dirt-cheap stock price. That combination of income and value is why I recently bought more of the telecom stock. Given its current valuation, I plan to load up on more shares this year.\n\nA low-risk, high-yielding payout\n\nHigh-yield dividend stocks tend to have higher risk profiles. They often have high dividend payout ratios, questionable growth prospects, and weak balance sheets. However, while Verizon has experienced some growth-related headwinds in recent years, it has a rock-solid financial profile.\n\nVerizon produced $26.5 billion of cash flow from operations through the first nine months of last year. While that was down from $28.8 billion in the prior-year period, it covered its capital expenditures ($12 billion) with $14.5 billion to spare. That free cash flow easily funded the company's dividend outlay ($8.2 billion), enabling it to retain cash to strengthen its already solid balance sheet.\n\nThe company ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 2.5, an improvement from 2.6 a year earlier. Verizon has a lower leverage level than rival AT&T, which ended the third quarter at 2.8 (above its target, which is in the range of 2.5). Verizon's leverage supports its solid investment-grade bond ratings (A-/BBB+/Baa1). The telecom's long-term goal is to further strengthen its financial foundation by reaching an even lower leverage target in the 1.75 to 2.0 range.\n\nGetting back to growth\n\nVerizon is using its strong balance sheet to accelerate the growth of its fiber network by acquiring Frontier Communications in a $20 billion all-cash deal. That transaction will expand its fiber network to reach 25 million premises. The company expects the purchase -- which likely won't close until next year -- to be immediately accretive to its earnings while generating at least $500 million in annual cost synergies.\n\nThe transaction will initially boost Verizon's leverage ratio. However, the increased free cash flow following the deal will enable it to quickly reduce its debt. It will likely achieve its long-term leverage target by 2027. That could allow Verizon to launch a share repurchase program to complement its high-yielding dividend.\n\nIn addition to the future growth from Frontier, Verizon is starting to see the benefits of the heavy investments it made in expanding its broadband and 5G networks, which should continue. During the third quarter, it achieved its fixed wireless subscriber target 15 months ahead of schedule. It also delivered double-digit percentage growth in total broadband connections. These factors have the company on track to start delivering profitable growth again.\n\nThat would enhance Verizon's ability to continue increasing its dividend. It delivered its 18th consecutive annual dividend boost late last year. That's the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. While Verizon has been delivering modest hikes (less than 2% annually in recent years), it has been able to continue growing its dividend, which is something AT&T hasn't been able to do. (AT&T cut its payout by nearly 50% in 2022.)\n\nAn attractive value\n\nGiven Verizon's growth issues in recent years, its share price has slumped (down nearly 30% over the past three years). Because of that, it currently trades at just 8 times forward earnings, which is significantly below the broader market's forward P/E of more than 23. That dirt-cheap earnings multiple is why Verizon has such a high dividend yield.\n\nI believe Verizon can supply me with an attractive stream of dividend income that should continue to rise modestly. On top of that, I think its share price will eventually recover as its earnings begin growing. Add that to the income, and I think this investment could produce solid total returns over the coming years. That's why I've continued buying shares and plan to purchase a boatload more in 2025 if the stock keeps trading around its current level.",

            "content": "Detroit is an integral part of American history as an automobile hub, but the Motor City also lays claims to fame in sports (go, Lions), music (hello, Motown) and even food (cheesy, rectangular pizza). Although the city has cemented its legacy, it\u2019s still upcoming when it comes to the latest and best broadband options. Detroit currently sits in 41st place on Speedtest.net\u2019s ranking of city speeds for the 100 most populous US cities.\n\nDetroit might not have the fastest internet provider options in the country, but Xfinity, our choice for the best ISP in the Motor City, offers its gigabit speeds to just about every corner of town. Fast fiber from AT&T Fiber or Zentro (formerly Snip) Internet (for certain apartments) is also available in certain areas. Get your motor running, and let\u2019s explore the best internet providers in Detroit. Here is our guide to the best internet provider options for Detroit so you can get the best internet service.\n\nBest internet providers in the Motor City\n\nThere is only one major player among ISPs in Detroit: Xfinity. No one else can top its combination of coverage and speeds across all parts of the city. It faces competition in some areas from AT&T Fiber, which offers fast upload speeds to go with fast downloads. Some residents may want to test an alternative from a fixed wireless provider like Verizon 5G Home Internet.\n\nNote: The prices, speeds and features detailed in the article text may differ from those listed in the product detail cards, which represent providers\u2019 national offerings. Your particular internet service options -- including prices and speeds -- depend on your address and may differ from those detailed here.\n\nAll available Detroit residential internet providers\n\nISP availability across the Detroit metro area is very situational. While Xfinity has the broadest coverage in Detroit proper, you\u2019ll find Spectrum or WOW cable services in some communities around the city. Zentro Internet (formerly Snip Internet) is a good fiber option for certain apartment buildings in Detroit. On the fixed wireless side, T-Mobile Home Internet is an alternative to Verizon 5G Home Internet, and it\u2019s an especially good deal for T-Mobile phone customers.\n\nAT&T Internet : AT&T Internet is different from AT&T Fiber. This old-school DSL service isn\u2019t known for good speeds. Depending on location, you may be able to pull down 100Mbps, or you may get internet that\u2019s at a painful crawl. The cost is $55 per month with no contract, but it\u2019s not your best option unless no other ISPs service your home.\n\n: AT&T Internet is different from AT&T Fiber.

The cost is $55 per month with no contract, but it\u2019s not your best option unless no other ISPs service your home. Zentro Internet : Zentro Internet has acquired Snip internet, and provides fiber to apartment buildings around Detroit, concentrating in the downtown area. Like Snip, Zentro positions itself as a fast, hip alternative to other ISPs. There are no contracts, no data caps and no installation fees, and equipment is included. The $75-a-month plan gets you speeds up to 1,000Mbps. If you live in an apartment serviced by Zentro, you\u2019ll find lots to like about the no-fuss plan and reasonable pricing.\n\n: Zentro Internet has acquired Snip internet, and provides fiber to apartment buildings around Detroit, concentrating in the downtown area.

Spectrum : Charter\u2019s Spectrum cable service can be found in northwestern parts of the metro area, including Livonia and Farmington Hills. Call Spectrum for details on all the plans available for your address. A popular option is a 500Mbps plan for $60 monthly with no data cap or contract. A modem is included. If that\u2019s not fast enough, look for the $70-a-month 1,000Mbps plan. Be aware that prices will jump after the first two years.\n\n: Charter\u2019s Spectrum cable service can be found in northwestern parts of the metro area, including Livonia and Farmington Hills.

WOW : \u201cWOW\u201d stands for WideOpenWest, a cable provider serving six states. Coverage is focused on the wider metro area around Detroit, particularly to the north and west. In some areas, plans range from 100Mbps up to 1,200Mbps, but you may find a sweet spot with a promotional deal like the Internet 1 Gig plan for $50 a month for the first two years. There\u2019s an option to add Wi-Fi for $10 a month. Look for a promotional gift card offer. You may luck out and find a deal where WOW covers your modem rental, but you can provide your own modem for most plans. Data caps vary from 1.5TB or 3TB on most plans, though the Internet 1.2 Gig plan is unlimited.\n\n: \u201cWOW\u201d stands for WideOpenWest, a cable provider serving six states.

T-Mobile Home Internet : Verizon competitor T-Mobile Home Internet is the other option for fixed wireless in Detroit. There\u2019s one plan with typical speeds from 72-245Mbps for $60 a month. Add an eligible phone plan, and your home internet will be just $40 monthly. Slots may be limited, so you must run your address to see if the service is available at your home.\n\n: Verizon competitor T-Mobile Home Internet is the other option for fixed wireless in Detroit.

Satellite internet: Rural residents often look to satellite internet from Starlink, Viasat or HughesNet as a lifeline. City dwellers in Detroit, however, will find cable, fiber or fixed wireless makes more sense. One exception is Starlink\u2019s travel plan. It\u2019s not cheap, but it can keep avid RVers and digital nomads connected and working on the go.\n\nMark Gibson/Getty Images\n\nDetroit broadband at a glance\n\nNo matter where you live in Detroit, there's a good chance Xfinity services your address. In some parts of the metro area, you may also have AT&T Fiber, WOW, Spectrum or Zentro to choose from. T-Mobile and Verizon may have open slots if you\u2019d like to test out fixed wireless as an alternative. If it\u2019s down to Xfinity or AT&T\u2019s outdated DSL service, then Xfinity is your friend. Once you know who services your home, you can compare prices and speeds to find the best plan for your needs.\n\nTake our quiz Get Started Progress Step 1 of 4 How many members of your household use the internet? 1-2 people\n\n3-5 people\n\n6-9 people\n\n10+ people Next\n\nPricing details on Detroit home internet service\n\nThe average starting price for home internet in the Detroit area works out to just under $48 a month. Promotional deals from Xfinity or WOW can dip below that, or you can score a deal by bundling an eligible phone plan with home internet from Verizon or T-Mobile. The intro price level for fiber is $55 for 300Mbps from AT&T Fiber.\n\nCheap internet options in the Detroit metro area\n\nThe cheapest internet plan you can get will depend on which ISPs connect to your home. If that\u2019s Xfinity (and it likely is), you can get online with a $20-a-month, 150Mbps plan. But that might not be your best deal in the long term since the promo price is only good for a year. Look for special offers at Xfinity\u2019s faster speed levels and do the math. WOW is plenty competitive with its $30, 12-month promo at the 300Mbps level, so give that a look if WOW runs to your address.\n\nRegarding bang for the buck, AT&T\u2019s 300Mbps fiber plan for $55 gives you reasonable download speeds and equally fast upload speeds. Zentro Internet is a good deal for eligible apartment dwellers at $75 for 1,000Mbps.\n\nFastest internet providers in Detroit\n\nOokla\u2019s Speedtest data shows Detroit with a median fixed internet download speed of about 154Mbps, which we already know isn\u2019t the fastest around. You can still find decent internet speeds if you\u2019re in the right location. AT&T Fiber delivers multigigabit plans, while other ISPs have options for service at or around the 1,000Mbps level. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nAT&T Fiber\u2019s 5,000Mbps plan is untouchable when it comes to residential internet speeds in Detroit. The challenges with this are spotty availability across the metro area and the hefty price of $250 a month. AT&T\u2019s 2,000Mbps plan is still fast but runs a more affordable $150 monthly. If you\u2019re shopping around for gigabit service, there are more options, with WOW, Spectrum, Zentro and Xfinity all offering plans at that level. Here\u2019s what you need to know about multi-gigabit internet plans.\n\nWhat\u2019s the final word on internet providers in Detroit?\n\nNot everyone in Detroit will be able to pull down multi-gigabit speeds, but locations covered by AT&T Fiber can access that luxury. Thanks to its equally fast upload and download speeds (a trait that remote workers and avid gamers will love), fiber trumps other internet connection types. Limited fiber availability doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be left surfing in the dark ages. Xfinity\u2019s wide coverage area delivers gigabit download speeds. Residents in the wider metro area can also look for gigabit plans from WOW or Spectrum.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Detroit\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we\u2019re considering every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. To evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service, we look at sources including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n\nDo customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n\nAre customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend.\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our How We Test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Detroit FAQs\n\nIs fiber internet available in Detroit? It might feel like fiber is a matter of luck in Detroit. AT&T Fiber is available but has patchwork coverage across the metro area. Some homes can get AT&T\u2019s fastest 5,000Mbps plan for $250 a month. Apartment dwellers may be in luck with Zentro Internet, an ISP specializing in fiber to multi-unit dwellings. Zentro's Z1000 plan is $75 a month for 1,000Mbps. That\u2019s a good deal for fiber. Show more\n\nWho is the cheapest internet provider in Detroit? Looking at the wider metro area, people in WOW\u2019s service zones can check into the $30-a-month, 300Mbps plan. The catch is that the price is subject to change, but you can get a price lock-in for $5/month extra. You can rent a modem for an additional $10 monthly or use your own. Bargain hunters should also check into fixed wireless from T-Mobile or Verizon. Bundle with an eligible phone plan and you\u2019ll get a steep discount on your home internet, bringing it as low as $30 a month with T-Mobile or $25 a month with Verizon. Show more",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "Verizon, Vici Properties, and Opera all look like undervalued income generators.\n\nMany dividend stocks lost their luster in 2022 and 2023 as rising interest rates drove jittery investors toward safer CDs, Treasury bills, and other fixed-income investments. However, many of those high-yielding dividend stocks stabilized in 2024 as the Federal Reserve finally implemented three interest rate cuts.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield is still hovering near 4.7% as of this writing, but the Fed plans to cut interest rates at least two more times in 2025. As that happens, more investors will likely rotate back toward the market's high-yielding dividend stocks.\n\nBut before that rotation occurs, you should probably buy some of those stocks while they're still trading at historically low valuations with high yields. If you have at least $1,000 to spare, you can easily churn out $40-$70 in extra annual income with these underappreciated dividend stocks: Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%), Vici Properties (VICI 2.22%), and Opera (OPRA 3.08%).\n\nVerizon\n\nVerizon might initially seem like a lousy dividend stock. Over the past five years, the telecom giant's share prices have tumbled 36%. Even after including its reinvested dividends, it delivered a negative total return of 14% over that timespan. It struggled to grow its core wireless business, fend off its competitors, and meaningfully reduce its debt.\n\nBut after that decline, Verizon stock looks dirt cheap at just 8 times forward earnings and pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 7.1%. That low valuation and high yield should limit its downside potential if it turns its business around.\n\nIn 2023, Verizon's revenue fell 2% as its consumer segment struggled to gain new wireless subscribers and its business segment faced tougher macro headwinds. But in the first nine months of 2024, its total revenue rose 0.3% year over year as the growth of its consumer segment offset its business segment's declining revenue.\n\nThat recovery was driven by its localized incentives and marketing campaigns, customizable \"myPlans,\" distribution partnership with Walmart, and the recent acquisition of the prepaid wireless provider TracFone. The wireless segment's earnings margins are also stabilizing as it cuts costs to offset its lower-margin promotions.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect Verizon's revenue to stay flat as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) dips 2%. But for 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 2% and 3%, respectively. So, if you believe this telecom giant is finally due for a turnaround, it would be smart to buy its high-yielding stock at this discount valuation.\n\nVici Properties\n\nVici Properties is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns casinos and entertainment properties in the U.S. and Canada. As a REIT, it buys up properties, rents them out, and splits the rental income with its investors. To maintain a favorable tax rate, it also must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income as dividends.\n\nVici owns 93 properties, including three of the Las Vegas Strip's most iconic casinos: Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, and the Venetian. Its top tenants include Caesar's Entertainment, MGM Resorts, Penn Entertainment, and Century Casinos.\n\nVici is more resilient than other REITs for two reasons: It locks its tenants into multi-decade leases, with rent increases mostly pinned to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to hedge against inflation, and most casinos are resistant to recessions. That's why it's maintained an occupancy rate of 100% since its initial public offering in 2018, even as the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, inflation, and rising interest rates rattled the global economy.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2023, Vici's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8%, and it expects that figure to grow 5% in 2024. At $29, its stock looks like a bargain at 13 times that AFFO estimate, and it pays a high forward dividend yield of 6%. That makes it a great play for value-minded income investors.\n\nOpera\n\nOpera develops web browsers and a news app. It controls only about 2% of the global web browser market, according to StatCounter, but it still served 296 million monthly active users (MAUs) across all its apps in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOpera has been struggling to gain new users in a market dominated by larger browsers, but it's locking in its existing users with new artificial intelligence (AI) tools and rolling out more integrated ads to grow its average revenue per MAU. Its latest browser, Opera One, bundles generative AI tools from OpenAI with its own integrated AI assistant, Aria.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Opera's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 20% and 32%, respectively. For 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to increase another 16% and 21%, respectively, as it rolls out more AI and advertising features. Those are stunning growth rates for a stock trading at just 8 times forward earnings.\n\nOpera also started to pay semiannual dividends in 2023. It currently pays a forward yield of 4.4%, surprisingly high for a smaller growth stock. Therefore, Opera looks like a uniquely appealing play for value, dividend, and growth investors.",

American Express is expected to issue its fourth-quarter report on Friday, after the credit card issuer raised its full-year profit outlook in its prior report.\n\nInvestors are looking for a rebound from 3M on Tuesday after two of its three divisions posted declining sales in the previous quarter. After rival Delta Air Lines posted strong earnings earlier this month, United Airlines is set to report on Tuesday after its earnings outlook for the quarter was better than analysts had projected.\n\nOn Wednesday, consumer products maker Procter & Gamble earnings are expected to come out after the company\u2019s sales in the prior quarter were below estimates. Travelers\u2019 Wednesday report comes as some insurance providers have experienced share-price declines over worries about the costs of the California wildfires.\n\nThe earnings reports of railroad shipping firms Union Pacific and CSX\u2014expected on Thursday\u2014will provide insight into the strength of the transportation and shipping sector. GE Aerospace's report, also set to release that day, will show whether its commercial engines and services division can return to expectations, while GE Vernova is expected to report Wednesday amid analyst optimism over its gas turbines.\n\nOn Friday, Verizon Communications will look to show continued growth in its wireless phone and internet subscriber base.\n\n",

            "content": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to many companies claiming AI capabilities. Although not all of these are worthy AI investments, telecom giant Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%) may be an overlooked sleeper AI stock.\n\nAI darling Nvidia, for example, saw shares rise more than 130% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, as recently as Jan. 10, Verizon shares hit a 52-week low of $37.59, and they remain near this low.\n\nBut how is Verizon contributing to the AI market's expansion? Is it a buy with its share price down? Let's dig into the company to address these questions.\n\nVerizon's role in the AI industry's growth\n\nVerizon contributes to the growth of the AI sector through its 5G wireless network. Its 5G service supports the fast speeds and security required to deliver AI to devices on the edge of a computer network, such as laptops and mobile phones.\n\nAn example of Verizon's role in the AI edge computing space is its partnership with Nvidia to deliver AI to private networks, which are wireless services dedicated to specific organizations. For instance, Verizon will provide a private network to FIFA for the men's 2026 World Cup.\n\nAccording to CEO Hans Vestberg, \"As we expand our 5G Ultra Wideband network and scale our private networks business, we're opening up new opportunities for growth and innovation.\"\n\nBringing AI to the edge positions Verizon to do just that. That's because the AI edge computing sector is forecast to expand tenfold from $27 billion in 2024 to $270 billion by 2032. Delivering AI to the edge is key to facilitating the growth of self-driving cars, robotics, and the Internet of Things.\n\nThe company is currently growing revenue from its wireless services. In Q3, this part of Verizon's business produced $19.8 billion in sales, a 3% year-over-year increase.\n\nFactors hurting Verizon's share price\n\nThe growth of the AI edge computing industry is a promising tailwind for Verizon's sales. However, other factors weigh on the company and, hence, its stock price.\n\nWhile wireless service sales are growing, overall revenue is not. In Q3, total revenue of $33.3 billion was flat compared to 2023. The company's revenue growth stalled as equipment sales fell year over year amid a macroeconomic environment of lower consumer discretionary spending.\n\nAnother factor is Verizon's large debt burden. The telecom exited Q3 with over $150 billion in debt on its balance sheet. This debt could increase as the company prepares to acquire Frontier Communications Parent, a broadband internet service provider, in the coming months.\n\nThat said, the Frontier acquisition sets Verizon up to strengthen its rapidly growing broadband business, which also contributes to delivering AI to the edge. At the end of Q3, Verizon had total broadband connections of 12 million, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Acquiring Frontier will nearly double this by adding an estimated 10 million homes by 2026.\n\nOther factors to consider with Verizon stock\n\nAlthough Verizon shoulders a large debt burden, the company benefits from the ability to generate strong free cash flow (FCF). FCF provides insight into the cash available to invest in the business, pay debt obligations, and fund dividends. The company's Q3 FCF was $6 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $14.5 billion.\n\nThis easily covered Verizon's $8.4 billion in dividend payments made through the first nine months of 2024, leaving cash to pay down debt and support business growth. Dividends are a key reason to consider an investment in Verizon. The firm's dividend yield is a staggering 7%. Also, Verizon raised its dividend for the 18th straight year in September. This long streak of increases, plus the telecom's excellent FCF, means it's a reliable source of passive income.\n\nOn top of that, Verizon reaching a 52-week low recently led to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of eight. This metric helps to assess stock valuation by telling you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on estimates for the next 12 months.\n\nVerizon's forward P/E multiple is lower than that of its main rivals, AT&T and T-Mobile US. This suggests its stock is a better value than its competitors. Its low forward earnings multiple, coupled with a robust dividend, strong FCF, and a growing wireless service business, combine to make Verizon stock a buy.\n\nHold onto shares as a long-term investment to benefit from its dividend while the telecom titan tackles the growing AI edge computing market.",

            "content": "U.S. prosecutors have formally linked the arrest of a serving U.S. Army soldier in December to a massive theft of U.S. phone records from AT&T and Verizon last year.\n\nAuthorities arrested Cameron John Wagenius, a U.S. Army communications specialist, in Texas on December 20 following a brief two-page grand jury indictment accusing the U.S. serviceperson of two counts of unlawfully transferring confidential phone records. Wagenius was later extradited to Washington state.\n\nIn a new court filing on Friday, U.S. prosecutors confirmed that the charges against Wagenius are related to the earlier indictment of two alleged hackers, Connor Moucka and John Binns, who the U.S. government accused of multiple intrusions at cloud computing company Snowflake that saw the mass theft of data stored in its customer accounts. The Snowflake customers whose data was stolen include AT&T, which had \u201cnearly all\u201d of its customer call records through 2024 exfiltrated from its Snowflake account, and Verizon, from whom a substantial cache of customer call logs was taken.\n\nU.S. Attorney Tessa Gorman told the Seattle court that \u201cboth cases arise from the same computer intrusion and extortion and include some of the same stolen victim information,\u201d and as such, \u201cthese cases rely on overlapping evidentiary material and legal process and arguably present common questions of law and fact.\u201d\n\nThis is the first public acknowledgment by prosecutors that Wagenius\u2019 charges are connected to last year\u2019s breaches at Snowflake. Security journalist Brian Krebs first reported on the link between Wagenius and the Snowflake hacks in November, and later broke the news of Wagenius\u2019 arrest.\n\nThe account hacks at Snowflake became one of the most wide-reaching cyberattacks of last year, affecting AT&T, LendingTree, Santander Bank, Ticketmaster, and at least 160 other companies. The hackers allegedly stole huge banks of personally identifiable and sensitive corporate data that companies stored in Snowflake, in part by using passwords stolen from employee computers with malware. Most of the affected Snowflake customers were not using multi-factor protection, which Snowflake did not require of its customers at the time.\n\nAccording to Krebs\u2019 reporting, following the earlier arrest of Moucka by Canadian authorities, Wagenius claimed in a post on a known cybercrime forum to have access to the call logs of Vice President Kamala Harris and President-elect Donald Trump, and threatened to leak all of the stolen files unless Moucka was released.\n\nProsecutors accuse the Snowflake hackers of stealing data that includes personal information, cell phone and IMEI numbers, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, passwords, Social Security numbers, government-issued identity numbers, and payment card and bank account numbers.\n\nWagenius was ordered on January 8 to be detained and is understood to be in custody in Washington state.",

Although not all of these are worthy AI investments, telecom giant Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) may be an overlooked sleeper AI stock.\n\nAI darling Nvidia, for example, saw shares rise more than 130% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, as recently as Jan. 10, Verizon shares hit a 52-week low of $37.59, and they remain near this low.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nBut how is Verizon contributing to the AI market's expansion? Is it a buy with its share price down? Let's dig into the company to address these questions.\n\nVerizon's role in the AI industry's growth\n\nVerizon contributes to the growth of the AI sector through its 5G wireless network. Its 5G service supports the fast speeds and security required to deliver AI to devices on the edge of a computer network, such as laptops and mobile phones.\n\nAn example of Verizon's role in the AI edge computing space is its partnership with Nvidia to deliver AI to private networks, which are wireless services dedicated to specific organizations. For instance, Verizon will provide a private network to FIFA for the men's 2026 World Cup.\n\nAccording to CEO Hans Vestberg, \"As we expand our 5G Ultra Wideband network and scale our private networks business, we're opening up new opportunities for growth and innovation.\"\n\nBringing AI to the edge positions Verizon to do just that. That's because the AI edge computing sector is forecast to expand tenfold from $27 billion in 2024 to $270 billion by 2032. Delivering AI to the edge is key to facilitating the growth of self-driving cars, robotics, and the Internet of Things.\n\nThe company is currently growing revenue from its wireless services. In Q3, this part of Verizon's business produced $19.8 billion in sales, a 3% year-over-year increase.\n\nFactors hurting Verizon's share price\n\nThe growth of the AI edge computing industry is a promising tailwind for Verizon's sales. However, other factors weigh on the company and, hence, its stock price.\n\nWhile wireless service sales are growing, overall revenue is not. In Q3, total revenue of $33.3 billion was flat compared to 2023. The company's revenue growth stalled as equipment sales fell year over year amid a macroeconomic environment of lower consumer discretionary spending.\n\nAnother factor is Verizon's large debt burden. The telecom exited Q3 with over $150 billion in debt on its balance sheet. This debt could increase as the company prepares to acquire Frontier Communications Parent, a broadband internet service provider, in the coming months.\n\nThat said, the Frontier acquisition sets Verizon up to strengthen its rapidly growing broadband business, which also contributes to delivering AI to the edge. At the end of Q3, Verizon had total broadband connections of 12 million, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Acquiring Frontier will nearly double this by adding an estimated 10 million homes by 2026.\n\nOther factors to consider with Verizon stock\n\nAlthough Verizon shoulders a large debt burden, the company benefits from the ability to generate strong free cash flow (FCF). FCF provides insight into the cash available to invest in the business, pay debt obligations, and fund dividends. The company's Q3 FCF was $6 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $14.5 billion.\n\nThis easily covered Verizon's $8.4 billion in dividend payments made through the first nine months of 2024, leaving cash to pay down debt and support business growth. Dividends are a key reason to consider an investment in Verizon. The firm's dividend yield is a staggering 7%. Also, Verizon raised its dividend for the 18th straight year in September.

This suggests its stock is a better value than its competitors.

            "content": "You've heard of the big names in 5G home internet: T-Mobile, Verizon, Starry and AT&T Internet Air, but what is 5G home internet and what makes this technology stand out from the rest?\n\nFor most Americans, internet service providers are a constant source of stress to consumers and, notoriously, one of the lowest-rated industries in the US. ISPs rank lower than social media, the US Postal Service and even airlines. We can collectively agree on why: wading through confusing details like hidden fees, yearly price hikes, contracts, service details and even the different speeds, can make for a frustrating experience.\n\nMany rural Americans know how difficult it is to find a good internet provider at their address, some can often feel like there are hardly any options at all. Could 5G be the answer?\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nThe technology powering the latest phones is tackling our household broadband needs. In addition, cellular internet like 5G could help rural and underserved communities to stay connected. According to the 2024 J.D. Power Survey, 5G home internet can be a cheaper and more accessible internet connection type than cable or fiber. It may not produce the fastest speeds, but customers are willing to overlook that. CNET has reviewed all the major 5G services and we've got the details on how they work, what speeds you can expect, what it costs and where it's available. Read on to see if a 5G connection is for you.\n\nSo, what is 5G home internet?\n\nSimply put, 5G stands for the fifth generation. The fifth generation of what? The fifth generation of wireless data networks. You're probably most familiar with hearing 5G used to describe better mobile communications and speedier phones. You're not wrong: 5G networks, which use different radio frequencies than previous generations, aim to provide faster data speeds with much less lag or delay than we had with 4G. However, while 5G cellular service might be available on your phone, 5G home internet is not as widely available.\n\nLocating local internet providers\n\nHow fast is 5G home internet?\n\nMy CNET colleague Eli Blumenthal does a great job of breaking down the basics of 5G. Millimeter-wave technology uses higher frequencies than previous generations, providing faster speeds and connections. Those higher, gigabit speeds come with a price: the data doesn't travel the same distance as 4G and has more trouble with obstructions. To combat that, midband technology, which offers speeds averaging between 300 and 400 megabits per second, increases the coverage area provided by millimeter-wave. Finally, low-band 5G offers a range similar to 4G but speeds between 100 and 200Mbps.\n\nIs 5G home internet the same as 5GHz?\n\nNope. One common mistake is to see the \"5GHz\" setting on your Wi-Fi router and assume you have access to 5G. Wi-Fi routers also use short-range radio frequencies (typically either 2.4GHz or 5GHz) to transmit your internet signal to connected devices within your home. 5GHz might be one of the band options for your home's Wi-Fi system, but it's not the same as 5G, which is a cellular technology that uses higher-frequency waves.\n\nCable, DSL and fiber internet plans require wires connecting your home to the provider's grid. Fixed wireless services, like 5G, connect your home to a provider's network over the air. Taylor Martin/CNET\n\nHow does 5G home internet stand out?\n\nMost ISPs deliver internet service via phone lines or cables connecting your home to a more extensive network. That includes common internet connection types like digital subscriber lines or DSL, coaxial cable and fiber-optic internet. Those are all wired connections from your provider to your home.\n\n5G home internet, on the other hand, is a fixed wireless internet service, which means that the connection between your provider and your home is not wired. With 5G, you will need an indoor or outdoor 5G receiver at your house to pick up the signal. It's similar to satellite internet, but instead of beaming in a signal from satellites orbiting in the night sky, it's relaying information from a much closer wireless hub. Although you're using the same 5G network as your mobile phone, the gateway is specific to your location and cannot be used elsewhere.\n\nWhat providers offer 5G home internet?\n\n5G is still being deployed across the country. Therefore, the number of providers offering any 5G home internet plan is relatively limited. Your 5G home internet options are AT&T Internet Air, Starry, T-Mobile and Verizon. All prices listed on this page reflect available discounts for setting up paperless billing. If you decide not to go with automatic monthly payments, your monthly bill will be higher. Now, let's explore what each offers.\n\nAT&T Internet Air Price range $60 per month Speed range 75-225Mbps Connection Fixed Wireless Key Info Equipment included, no contracts, no overage fees AT&T Internet Air uses AT&T's 5G wireless network and features download speeds between 90 and 300Mbps. The setup process is as simple as plugging in your router, setting up the Wi-Fi network and figuring out the best location in your home. CNET's broadband expert Joe Supan discovered this at home, taking him only 11 minutes to set up. When it comes to latency, AT&T Internet is on par with T-Mobile, Starry and Verizon, featuring a latency between 30 to 65ms. The straightforward pricing (just one plan for $60 or $47 when bundled with an eligible AT&T wireless plan), terms of service and decent speeds make Internet Air a reliable option for many customers with access to it. The Internet Air router is included in your monthly cost and you save money since no professional installation is required. AT&T offers mesh Wi-Fi extenders for an additional $10 monthly for improved connection. There are no overage fees, data caps or contracts. Read our picks for the best Wi-Fi extenders available in the market right now. What AT&T Internet Air lacks, however, is the same availability as its competitors. Although it's available across 48 states, many of those locations boast equal availability for AT&T's fiber internet option, which outpaces fixed wireless in terms of fast, reliable speeds and cost per Mbps.

Upload speeds are not symmetrical and will plateau at 50Mbps or less because Verizon does not exclusively use millimeter-wave technology, but rather a mix of low-band, mid-band and millimeter-wave. Verizon 5G Home Internet pricing is $50 a month for 50 to 300Mbps or $70 monthly for 85 to 1,000Mbps, plus some extra perks. Unlike most ISPs, you can expect a two to three-year price lock. Either way, it's an all-in price that includes equipment, setup fees and taxes. Like all other Verizon plans, it requires no contracts or data caps. Verizon offers many promos and deals to sweeten the pot for potential customers. First, both plans come with a price lock of up to five years, a rare gem in the world of broadband. In addition, if you switch to Verizon, eligible customers can receive an early termination fee credit of up to $500. Second, 5G Home Plus customers can have a free Netflix and Max subscription for a year. Lastly, customers with qualifying Verizon mobile plans will get a discount on the monthly cost of either plan, bringing them down to $35 or $45 monthly. Read our Verizon 5G Home Internet review.

While the list of cities seems to expand nearly every month, most are larger US cities.\n\nT-Mobile Home Internet is the most widely available service among the three highlighted providers, with coverage of 60%, according to the FCC. While Verizon's 5G home internet service is now available to 40 million homes, T-Mobile leapfrogged that by expanding its fixed wireless service to over 50 million households. Still, T-Mobile acknowledges it does not have unlimited availability across those locations due to network capacity.\n\nVerizon's 5G Home Internet is currently offered in approximately 900 markets or 19% of the country. Although the total number of households in which it is available is less than T-Mobile's, it does cover more cities.\n\nAT&T Internet Air is not quite as widely available as T-Mobile Home Internet or Verizon 5G Home Internet. The service is still slowly expanding but making decent progress, available to nearly 100 locations in 48 states and covers just over 14% of the country.\n\nStarry Internet is available in Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington, DC serving only 1% of the country, according to the FCC.\n\nFinal thoughts: Is 5G home internet for you?\n\nThe first thing to say is what we always say regarding ISPs: No matter how good the service, it's all moot if it's unavailable at your address. 5G technology is still being rolled out nationwide, so we should expect to see some bumps in the road as that effort continues.\n\nStill, 5G home internet availability is increasing at a pretty rapid pace. The affordable, straightforward pricing is vastly appealing and it's what jumps off the page for me. Time will tell if that trend holds as availability continues to expand. It would be a real step forward if 5G could emerge as a viable broadband option for traditionally underserved parts of rural America. As CNET alum Rick Broida put it after he tested T-Mobile's service, \"Imperfection is a lot more tolerable when you're paying less than half what you were before.\"\n\n5G home internet FAQs\n\nIs 5G home internet cheaper than other connection types? 5G home internet is one of the more affordable options available considering the decent download speeds that current plans average. T-Mobile averages just over 100Mbps, Starry chimes in at 200Mbps and Verizon's median speed is 300Mbps. The lowest monthly cost among the three main providers is $15 (Starry's low-cost option) and the highest is $70 (T-Mobile and Verizon 5G Home Internet Plus without the mobile discount). Each provider's monthly costs include all fees, taxes, equipment and installation charges. So the monthly charge you see is the monthly charge you pay. Lastly, none require term contracts, so you won't have to fear any early termination fees.\n\nIs 5G fast enough for home internet? In theory, 5G should enable a speedy connection that will match or improve what you get with cable or fiber internet. That's usually not the case regarding the reality of 5G home internet. To increase the reliability and coverage of the 5G internet service, most providers rely on a mix of millimeter-wave, low-band and midband technology -- as well as 4G LTE in some cases -- and this means home internet customers won't see the real high-end capabilities of 5G at present. You should see well over the average speeds of your typical DSL and satellite internet plans.\n\nWhat does the 'G' stand for in 5G? It simply means generation. In other words, 5G is the fifth generation of cellular technology.",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "In an industry already facing rising prices for goods, materials, and labor, even a slight cost increase can have a significant impact.\n\nOver the past five years, small and midsize construction businesses have been hit hard by supply chain disruptions, inflation, and geopolitical pressures that have driven up material costs and intensified labor shortages. While some market conditions have stabilized since the initial upheaval, many contractors still face persistent challenges, affecting their cash flow and bottom line. Here\u2019s a closer look at their top priorities and concerns today.\n\nInflation: A Persistent Challenge\n\nManaging cash flow is tough for any construction business, but it\u2019s an especially stubborn challenge for smaller construction businesses with tighter margins. Inflation, even at a reduced rate, continues to erode those margins. Even as prices stabilize in some areas, small businesses are still paying significantly more for materials than they did five years ago, and concerns are growing that costs could rise again.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, has fallen significantly from its 2022 peak (now at 2.7%, down from 8.0%), yet inflation remains the primary concern for construction and contracting companies. According to the 2024 State of Small Business Survey, 76% of contractors rank inflation as a top issue, well ahead of other concerns like online transaction security.\n\nSo why is inflation still a major worry despite its decline? First, \u201cbetter\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cgood\u201d \u2013 CPI remains above pre-pandemic norms. The cumulative effect of several years of high inflation has squeezed margins, while ongoing geopolitical and trade uncertainties keep costs and supply chain pressures unpredictable. In an industry already facing rising prices for goods, materials, and labor, even a slight cost increase can have a significant impact.\n\nA Delicate Balance: Labor Costs vs. Client Relationships\n\nRising labor costs are another pressing concern for small and midsize construction companies, with nearly two-thirds (63%) of contractors expecting further increases. For businesses already navigating slim margins, higher labor expenses worsen cash flow challenges and reduce profitability. In response, many small contractors are forced to make difficult choices, such as limiting the workforce on a project which can lead to longer hours, quality issues, and even project delays, eroding client satisfaction and future business opportunities. A resulting cash flow crunch may further restrict contractors\u2019 ability to take on new projects, creating a potential downward cycle that could threaten business viability.\n\nIn this climate, prioritizing strong client relationships has become essential, with nearly half of small contractors identifying it as a top priority. As economic pressures and labor costs climb, contractors may be forced to pass costs onto clients to avoid compromising quality. Building trust and emphasizing customer service can help contractors maintain client loyalty, even as rising expenses are felt across projects. In an industry where reputation is key, a strong focus on customer connections becomes a valuable asset for navigating turbulent times.\n\nPreparing for the Future: Pragmatism and Prudence\n\nGiven today\u2019s economic uncertainties, it\u2019s understandable to adopt a cautious approach. But relying on fear alone doesn\u2019t predict future outcomes. While current conditions may not reflect past strength, they also don\u2019t signal impending collapse. The economy, though not as strong as it once was, remains resilient. Small contractors will be best served by practicing judicious spending, focusing on operational efficiency, and investing in customer service. As the saying goes: hope for the best, but prepare for the worst \u2014 a balanced approach that combines optimism with prudent foresight.",

T-Mobile was earlier legally charged for passing off price increases as mandatory government charges. The companies have been scrutinized for initially offering good deals to entice users and after they are onboard with a plan, users have to face either incremental price increases or unexpected surcharges. The latest reported increase by Verizon is for customers with multi-line plans or shared usage and is expected to be a hike of $15 per month.\n\nVerizon is rumored to raise prices for Verizon family plans, stirring quite the debate online over the continuous rate increase and lack of transparency\n\nReports about Verizon's potential price increase are shared by someone who claims to be a Verizon supervisor on Reddit via Android Police. As per the post, starting this February 20th, myPlan rates for customers with five or more lines will see an increase in their cost, and the charges for four or more lines will be aligned with the five or more lines. In simpler words, this means that if the report stands true, there would be a $3 increase per line, which could translate to a minimum $15 hike for users with a five-line plan.\n\nUsers are already frustrated with the administrative fee increases that, although incremental, end up being more for users with multiple lines. If Verizon goes ahead with the pattern it has established of price hikes every now and then, it will raise concerns among customers regarding pricing transparency. It will be another example of bluffing the users into signing up by painting the plans as affordable or locked-in and then hitting them with sneaky fees or rate adjustments.\n\nMany Verizon users have expressed their dismay about the rumored price increase. Some have even blamed the company for luring them in by suggesting users can save by switching plans and adding subscriptions and then passing off these additional increases without informing users before the increase. Several staff members even shared the increased pressure they would be facing from customers as a result of the price increase. All of this is resulting in some users mentioning moving to T-Mobile instead.\n\nVerizon is not the only company with price hikes, as this seems to be a broader trend in the telecommunications industry. Most companies are steadily opting for price increases and citing these adjustments as operational costs or finding other justification for them. There should be greater transparency and regulatory notice of the ongoing pattern of creeping fees, so consumers do not feel stuck or blindsided by these increases.",

            "content": "The market expects Verizon Communications (VZ) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis largest U.S. cellphone carrier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.9%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $35.4 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.46% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verizon?\n\nFor Verizon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.40%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Verizon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verizon would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.19, delivering a surprise of +0.85%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

            "content": "Verizon couldn\u2019t even wait a full month into the new year to announce price increases on some of its most valuable customer accounts. Starting in February, myPlan customers with 5 or more lines are going to see a significant price increase to their monthly bills. Also, folks holding on to the older \u201cNew Verizon Plan\u201d plans of S, M, L, XL, and XXL are seeing even bigger increases.\n\nYesterday, Verizon began informing store employees that they were preparing to notify customers on myPlan accounts with 5+ lines that they would see an increase to their bills next month (\u201cno sooner than\u201d 2/20/2025 to be exact). Moments ago, those emails began hitting inboxes. The emails state that myPlan customers with 5 or more lines will see a reduced multi-line discount and that their bills would increase by $3/mo per line.\n\nHere\u2019s the bulk of the email:\n\nThanks for being a loyal Verizon customer. We\u2019re proud to provide you with the network that connects you to what matters most. In order to continue bringing you the best mobile experience, we\u2019re adjusting our plan prices. No sooner than 2.20.25, our myPlan multi-line discount for accounts with 5 or more lines will be reduced. This means the price for the myPlan lines below will increase by $3/mo per line.\n\nDoing a bit of math here, every single myPlan account with 5+ lines will see at least an $15/mo increase to their monthly bill. With a $3/mo per line increase, you can do the math to figure out how much your bill might go up, assuming you have 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or more lines. This Verizon price increase essentially brings the plans in line with the multi-line discount that 4-line accounts see.\n\nFor those on the \u201cNew Verizon Plan\u201d with options of S, M, L, XL, and XXL you too will see a price increase by 2/20/2025. These increases are $4/mo for single line accounts as an access fee, with shared multi-phone accounts seeing an added $15/mo as an access fee. As an added bonus, Verizon is also increasing the data overage fee from $15 per GB to $20 per GB.\n\nHere\u2019s the explanation of those changes from Verizon\u2019s site:\n\nEach shared data plan single phone line account will be charged an added $4/month line access fee.\n\nEach shared data plan multi-phone line account will be charged an added $15/month line access fee.\n\nThe data overage fee is increased from $15 to $20 per GB.\n\nVerizon states the need for this increase here as \u201cdue to rising operational costs.\u201d\n\nRecapping here \u2013 Verizon is raising prices on myPlan accounts with 5+ lines, as well as older S, M, L, XL, and XXL accounts.

            "content": "If you're looking to invest in Verizon Communication (VZ -0.32%) stock, odds are, you're doing it for the dividend income it can generate for you. That's because, historically, this hasn't been a good stock for growth investors to own. It has typically underperformed the market, and in five years it has declined by 36%.\n\nIs Verizon's stock likely to continue producing lackluster returns for investors in the future, or can this be a good contrarian pick to add to your portfolio today?\n\nThe last time Verizon stock outperformed the S&P 500 was in 2018\n\nIt hasn't just been one or two bad years for Verizon; the stock has generally been a poor investment when compared to the S&P 500. Here's a breakdown of how it has performed versus the broad index going back to 2018, which was the last time it was a market-beating stock.\n\nYear Verizon Stock S&P 500 2024 6.1% 23.3% 2023 -4.3% 24.2% 2022 -24.2% -19.4% 2021 -11.6% 26.9% 2020 -4.3% 16.3% 2019 9.2% 28.9% 2018 6.2% -6.2%\n\nDuring the past seven years, the best return the stock achieved was a 9.2% gain in 2019. And in four of those seven years, it declined in value.\n\nNow, the past doesn't predict the future, but it does offer some insight into how investors have viewed the investment and how the business has performed. In recent years, there has been a lot of volatility in the economy, with rising interest rates and high inflation resulting in less-than-ideal conditions for Verizon. Not only do rising rates make its debt look more worrisome, but higher costs for consumers have also resulted in fewer phone upgrades and general cutbacks on discretionary spending.\n\nVerizon's growth has been virtually nonexistent\n\nLater this month, Verizon will report on its latest earnings numbers, and the results will likely be modest, at best. The telecom company's growth has been flat or declining in recent quarters. There's little reason to expect that will improve in the near future.\n\nThe bottom line isn't showing improvement, either. In 2023, the company reported an operating profit of $28.7 billion -- nearly identical to the $28.8 billion operating profit it posted three years earlier in 2020. It was also the second consecutive year that the company's earnings declined.\n\nCan Verizon's stock turn things around in 2025?\n\nThere are two scenarios in which I can see Verizon potentially being a good buy this year.\n\nThe first is due to stronger economic conditions and consumers upgrading their phones, possibly to new artificial intelligence-powered devices. That can help bolster its growth and improve its top and bottom lines, giving investors a reason to be a bit more bullish on the business. However, it's too early to tell how likely of a scenario this proves to be.\n\nThe second is due to a further decline in interest rates. Lower rates could make the stock and its high-yielding dividend a more attractive option for income-seeking investors. However, with economic conditions perhaps not bad enough to warrant several rate cuts this year, this may be an unlikely scenario. Many investors appear to be scaling back their expectations for rate cuts this year, given the strong jobs report released earlier this month.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't expect shares of Verizon to take off this year, simply because there may not be a big catalyst out there for the telecom stock. But if you're looking for a fairly safe, high-yielding dividend, this can still make for a good investment to hang on to.",

            "content": "Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is an architecture that enables cloud computing capabilities and services at the edge of a mobile network. By running application workloads closer to mobile customers, network latency is reduced to tens of milliseconds and application response time is improved.\n\nAs one example of MEC, private MEC brings AWS compute and storage closer to the end-customer connected to a private network. This allows for not only the reduction of network latency to less than 20 milliseconds but also an increase in security and privacy. In this post, learn how Verizon\u2019s managed private MEC solutions \u2013 available through their 5G Edge portfolio \u2013 bring near real-time insights, decision-making, and data security to on-premises locations of enterprise customers alongside private 5G networks. Using AWS Hybrid and Edge services, Verizon has helped enterprises select the right hybrid edge solution across network connectivity, access patterns, consolidated billing, and technical support. After introducing how AWS Outposts can be used to deliver private MEC solutions, we show examples of operational models created for private MEC using AWS Hybrid and Edge services alongside private 5G networks offered by Verizon.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAcross on-premises data center (Outposts), retail stores (AWS Snow Family), major cities (AWS Local Zones), or at the edge of a 5G network (AWS Wavelength), AWS is reinventing hybrid and edge computing models to provide a continuum of consistent cloud services wherever customers need it to support their businesses. Beyond the preceding core compute and storage solutions, enterprise customers have asked for best practices regarding how to deploy Hybrid and Edge services alongside Private Mobile Networks (5G and LTE). To address customer requirements, we introduce private MEC using Outposts to provide cloud computing capabilities on-premises for the customer, coupled with Private Mobile Networks to deliver mobile coverage, high data throughput, and low latency for applications.\n\nPrivate MEC\n\nAs customers look to modernize their infrastructure operations, they frequently experience the following requirements:\n\nData Residency: Customers have stringent digital sovereignty requirements with a complementary desire to harness the capabilities, performance, innovation, and scale of the cloud.\n\nNetwork Throughput: Customers want to run applications that involve huge volumes of data, making data transfer unfeasible due to limited available network bandwidth.\n\nLocal Processing: Customers want to use local data processing to maximize the speed of decision-making for their downstream connected devices.\n\nPrivate MEC solutions deployed on Outposts address these challenges by providing a secure, dedicated cloud-computing platform and Verizon\u2019s reliable private 5G network. Verizon\u2019s private 5G network offers better performance, control, reliability, and density. By combining Verizon\u2019s private 5G network with Outposts, customers are using the benefits of 5G and the cloud on-premises while deploying low latency, high-performance applications using the same AWS experience.\n\nPrivate MEC use cases\n\nPrivate MEC with Private Mobile Networks has enabled many use cases in the following verticals:\n\nIndustry 4.0\n\nIndustrial control and automation, computer vision for video surveillance and safety, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications for productivity gains, and visualization of 3D datasets for CAD models or digital twins.\n\nEvents and Venues:\n\nEnhanced experiences with AR/VR, live information overlays, multi-camera, multiple angle views, personalized instance replaces, and many more use cases can improve the end user experience at venues such as sports, concerts, performances, and theme parks.\n\nHealthcare:\n\n5G and private MEC together can provide solutions for agile setups, real-time diagnostics with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), rapid access to radiological scans on-site, and local processing of sensitive patient data in healthcare verticals.\n\nShipping Ports and Airports:\n\nAt shipping ports and airports, real-time processing of manifests, luggage and container processing automation, predictive maintenance, AR-enabled connected port/airport workers, autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) control, passenger security, safety and monitoring, passenger temperature screening, and social distancing enforcement.\n\nWarehouses:\n\nAR enabled connected warehouse workforce, way-finding, AGV control, and inventory monitoring and updating.\n\nSchools and Universities:\n\nVirtual desktops, private networks for students in rural regions or areas of inadequate coverage, and improved campus coverage.\n\nSmart Cities:\n\nReal-time sensor driven automation, safety monitoring, climate controls, and energy savings.\n\nManaged private MEC: Solution overview\n\nManaged private MEC, offered by Verizon, has relieved customers from the undifferentiated heavy-lifting of building on-premises infrastructure. Application builders use the same AWS API and tools with which they are familiar. This provides a seamless developer experience and development velocity. AWS and Verizon have helped end-customers with the following:\n\nSelecting the right hybrid edge infrastructure option for the use-case (based on available site and network connectivity, workload types, scale/growth, cost, etc.)\n\nCreating account structure for onboarding end-customers\n\nSharing resources to end-customers\n\nConsolidated billing\n\nUsing multiple accounts plays an important role in how business, governance, security, and operational requirements are met. In a managed private MEC, Verizon orders an Outpost on behalf of the end-customer. Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) onboard various software, which provide business values to end-customers. In private MEC architectures, Verizon, end-customers and ISVs require multiple accounts to be created and overall deployment becomes very complicated very fast.\n\nTo address this requirement, AWS Organizations simplifies multi-account governance for customers with tools to centrally manage their AWS accounts. Organizations offers an account management service that enables the consolidation of multiple AWS accounts into an organization that is created and managed centrally. Organizations include account management and consolidated billing capabilities to meet the budgetary, security, and compliance needs of the end-customer. As an administrator of an Organization, accounts are created in an Organization and existing accounts are invited to join the Organization. As a best practice, accounts are grouped under Organizational Units (OUs) for better manageability and control. Organizations also supports nested OUs.\n\nFor data residency use-cases, you may consider applying Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict the usage of the AWS Region, thus only allowing resources to be launched on the Outpost. As a best practice, we recommend applying security guardrails to OUs rather than individual AWS accounts.\n\nWorkloads are grouped based on business purpose and ownership by sharing resources on Outposts to distinct accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). Sharing Outposts helps align the ownership and decision-making with individual accounts. Billing and metering for Outposts is linked to the owner account where the Outpost was created. When Outposts resources are shared with the account that represents the billing boundary for a workload, cost is managed using allocation tags applied to the workload resource to identify the Outpost usage. With Organization tag policies, consistent tags are maintained for Outpost consumer accounts.\n\nThe consolidated billing feature also helps Verizon with billing consolidation and payment for multiple AWS accounts. Verizon has management accounts in Organizations that incur the costs of the member accounts (end-customers). Consolidated billing, offered at no additional cost, allows users to track the changes across multiple accounts and download the combined cost and usage data. By combining the usage across the accounts in the Organization, Verizon accrues volume discounts, reserved instance discounts, and savings plans driving cost efficiency.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, AWS features such as AWS Organizations, AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) sharing, and consolidated billing along with Verizon\u2019s private 5G network helped design a managed private MEC offering. This operational model helps enterprise customers deploy private MEC use cases and start using low latency, data residency, and local data processing use cases without the burden of building and managing private MEC infrastructure. This managed private MEC architecture results in simplifying and expediting private MEC deployments across multiple industry verticals benefiting both Verizon and their end-customers.

            "content": "Dear Monica,\n\nI agree that T-Mobile has the best 5G coverage. Part of the reason this happened is the result of the order in which T-Mobile received the spectrum they use for 5G. The first 600 MHz spectrum became available in rural areas with fewer television stations to relocate to different channels. Unlike typical buildouts, T-Mobile installed 600 MHz base stations in rural areas with cleared spectrum first and they skipped earlier standards and went with 5G New Radio from the start. During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, T-Mobile had permission to rent 600 MHz spectrum from other license holders to use wide channels in all markets.\n\nIn parallel, the large amount of Sprint EBS/BRS spectrum allowed T-Mobile to start building a large capacity 5G network without waiting on clearing C Band spectrum.\n\nVerizon's reputation for best coverage was built on two major purchases. They purchased the rural cellular carrier Alltel starting in 2008 and they won a nationwide license for 700 MHz upper C block, also in 2008. This gave Verizon a chance to build a nationwide 4G LTE network with excellent coverage and building penetration while also having lots of original 850 MHz cellular spectrum for their CDMA voice network.\n\nIn my opinion, CDMA with single frequency networks and soft handoffs gave Verizon an early advantage over AT&T and T-Mobile with GSM networks that have hard handoffs that are more prone to dropped calls. With a soft handoff, the phone can receive signals from both the current base station and the next one simultaneously, making it less likely that calls gets dropped.\n\n\u2014 G.

            "content": "Verizon Communications, an American telecommunications company, said that it has successfully contained the cyber incident, a fact confirmed by an independent and reputable cybersecurity firm. The company was recently targeted by a nation-state threat actor, as reported by the U.S. government. These hackers are believed to have breached several national telecommunications networks, including Verizon infrastructure.\n\nSince September, hackers linked to the Chinese government have broken into a handful of U.S. internet service providers in recent months in pursuit of sensitive information, marking the latest intrusion into core U.S. infrastructure by entities tied to Beijing. In the hacking campaign called \u2018Salt Typhoon\u2019 by investigators, these cyber adversaries allegedly linked to China burrowed into America\u2019s broadband networks.\n\nThe New York headquartered company disclosed that in this incident, some individuals primarily involved in government or political activity were targeted by the threat actor. Those customers have been notified of the threat actor\u2019s activity. Also, the hackers accessed a small percentage of mobile internet access and mobile call records of other Verizon wireless customers.\n\nVerizon said that it \u2018does not have reason to believe that those customers were targeted, or that any banking or financial information or Social Security numbers were exposed.\u2019\n\nUpon learning of the incident, Verizon said, \u201cwe immediately took several key actions to protect our customers and our network. This includes working with federal law enforcement and national security agencies, industry partners, and private cybersecurity firms to investigate and contain the threat as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nIt added that this nation-state threat actor targeted a few individuals primarily involved in government or political activity. Those individuals have been notified about the threat actor\u2019s activity. The nation-state threat actor also accessed information related to a small percentage of mobile internet access and mobile call records of other Verizon wireless customers. For these customers, the threat actor did not access the content of their communications.\n\n\u201cImmediately upon learning of this incident, Verizon took several key actions to protect its customers and its network, including partnering with federal law enforcement and national security agencies, industry partners, and private cybersecurity firms,\u201d Vandana Venkatesh, Verizon\u2019s chief legal officer, said in a media statement. \u201cWe have not detected threat actor activity in Verizon\u2019s network for some time and, after considerable work addressing this incident, we can report that Verizon has contained the activities associated with this particular incident.\u201d\n\nVenkatesh added: \u201cOur goal from the beginning was to ensure that the nation\u2019s leading network provider remains resilient and best in class.\u201d\n\nVerizon continues to \u201cdevote significant resources to further strengthen and protect our network. This incident has not impacted our day-to-day operations, and customers can continue to use their Verizon devices and services as usual. We are unwavering in our commitment to offering our customers cutting-edge products and services over the nation\u2019s leading telecommunications network.\u201d\n\nTo deal with rising cybersecurity attacks from China, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned earlier this year Beijing-based cybersecurity vendor Integrity Tech for its role in multiple computer intrusion incidents against U.S. victims. These incidents have been publicly attributed to another Chinese state-sponsored cyber group Flax Typhoon, which has been active since at least 2021, often targeting organizations within U.S. critical infrastructure sectors.",

            "content": "2025 is shaping up to be a year of exciting technological advancements. As customer mobile data demands continue to soar, the need for continued enhancements on mobile networks has never been more apparent. To meet the connectivity needs of consumers and businesses and deliver on the promises of Artificial Intelligence (AI) going forward, driving technological advancements and pushing the boundaries of technology are going to be more important than ever. Customers expect us to be ahead of where technology is going and be a future-ready partner that can ensure they\u2019ll be connected, wherever they are.\n\nTo stay on the cutting-edge, here are six tech trends to keep on your radar this year.\n\nCloud-Native Networks Gain Importance. Cloud-native networks will become increasingly important for supporting customers' AI and machine learning workloads with the best performance. For the operator, having full control to orchestrate their own cloud not only will play a critical role for advanced services like network slicing and Edge Compute, but will also add critical flexibility to dynamically adapt to the customers needs in terms of capacity and topology. While cloud-native networks used to be considered a \u201cnice to have\u201d, it\u2019s not unlikely that the industry will now start to recognize they are essential to run AI workloads with specific requirements such as higher speeds, lower latency or added security.\n\nNetwork Slicing Use Cases Grow. As the 5G Standalone Core expands, we\u2019ll also see network slicing enabling more differentiated services for new applications beyond enhanced video calling. By dynamically matching network performance characteristics to specific application requirements, network slicing could see applications in numerous industries. For example, massive multi-player online gaming that requires occasional high bandwidth upload or download speeds and constant low latency, public safety where slicing can enhance situational awareness for personnel, or on a factory floor using 5G to run Autonomous Guided Vehicles.\n\nO-RAN is here. When it comes to Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technologies, the question is no longer if it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s here and will continue to evolve and mature. Establishing open and interoperable interfaces between different hardware and software components adds optionality, by increasing competition and creating opportunities for new entrants. This results in deployment flexibility for the operator, faster innovation in the industry, and greater service options. Greater competition, innovation, and increased supplier diversity is already starting to bring cost benefits to both operators and customers and it will continue on this trajectory as it progresses further with wider deployments and wider standardization efforts.\n\nThe AI inflection point is approaching. AI and Generative AI, with its predictive capabilities, are poised to be a critical component of digital transformation and future business growth in almost all industries. It\u2019s clear that a reliable, trusted 5G network is essential to the AI ecosystem since it provides the ability to power the processes of AI-generated activity with the ability to move massive amounts of data with minimal delay. For over a decade, we\u2019ve been using AI in our network to enhance internal efficiencies, elevate customer experiences, and optimize our network infrastructure. The transformation that is approaching will be driven by the use of the network for AI instead. This may stretch operators\u2019 networks in several ways. Consider the downlink/uplink balance for instance. While today most AI use cases require exchanges that are usually conversational, low in context and partially transactional, the next iterations on AI may add higher contextual awareness enabling chatbots or assistants to provide much more efficient support or even advise proactively without the need of prompts. This will require a constant feed of information resulting in new wider data streams in the uplink direction from the sensing device of choice on the customer end towards the inferencing point, driving a traffic pattern different from today\u2019s that may require some adaptation. All in all, the continuous investment in network infrastructure will remain key to retain unique strengths in meeting customer needs in the form of low latency, high bandwidth and robust mobile edge compute capabilities.\n\nAPIs drive new use cases and add value for customers. Network Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will come to the foreground making functionality not only dynamic but accessible and configurable by apps and by customers. This new useful interface for network services will help customers by turning the network into a platform where information and functionality are shared with the right industries and with the right privacy and security frameworks. Whether it is fraud prevention for the banking industry or assisting enterprise customers managing fleets of drones, enabling the right APIs can accelerate digital transformation, drive innovation, growth and profitability and help create deeper engagement with consumers, creating a better overall experience and brand loyalty.\n\nSatellite Direct-to-Device technology matures. In 2025, we will continue seeing \"text anywhere\" services that allow customers to stay connected wherever they are. Satellites will provide access to emergency messaging and location sharing even when a terrestrial cellular network is not available. Satellites can also drive innovation for enterprises by enabling IoT devices to roam onto a satellite network when out of range of the terrestrial cellular network providing enhanced geographic coverage for IoT devices. The challenge as of today remains for satellite technology to enable the operator to offer seamless and robust data and voice services to unmodified devices that match the quality and experience of the terrestrial network. Even if only viable in low densely populated areas, this would be a fundamental step towards a ubiquitous uniform service and this is an area where we may definitely see progress soon.\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, cutting-edge, advanced technology solutions like AI, private networks, cloud, edge computing, APIs, satellite or network slicing will be more and more vital to empower industries to adapt and succeed. One thing that for sure is not changing is that network providers will still need to continuously improve the customer experience, and remain trusted experts capable of guiding other businesses on their own AI journeys and working to infuse AI capabilities into their products to deliver more value by making interactions smarter, more intuitive, and ultimately more beneficial.",

The company operates through two segments, namely Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group.\n\nInside HON\u2019s Headlines\n\nThe Honeywell-Verizon bundled solution enhances business resiliency for retail and logistics companies.

We are unwavering in our commitment to offering our customers cutting-edge products and services over the nation\u2019s leading telecommunications network.\u201d\n\nDeputy National Security Adviser Anne Neuberger, speaking on the government response to the breach late last year, has said that at least eight telecom companies\u2014including AT&T, Verizon and Lumen\u2014and dozens of countries are known to have been affected by Salt Typhoon.\n\nNeuberger has also said that the White House does not believe any classified communications were accessed.\n\nIn the wake of the Salt Typhoon attack, the FCC is also taking a hard look at network security requirements. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has proposed a draft ruling that part of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) legislation requires telecommunications carriers to secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications. That ruling has been presented to all the members of the FCC and would become effectively immediately upon a passing vote, the FCC noted.\n\nRosenworcel also is proposing that telecom service providers submit annual attestation that they have \u201ccreated, updated, and implemented a cybersecurity risk management plan, which would strengthen communications from future cyberattacks.\u201d\n\nThe FCC would also pursue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking input on \u201cadditional ways to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of communications systems and services.\u201d\n\nIn related developments, the FCC also has proposed similar cybersecurity risk management plan requirements for submarine cable landing applicants and licensees, as incidents of deliberate cuts of sub-sea cables have risen. The Commission has also previously proposed that participants in the Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alerts maintain cybersecurity risk management plans, to prevent those systems from being hijacked.",

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines -- and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics -- browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one person sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two people to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more people to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Billings\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from FCC.gov.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. We use the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When it comes to selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds, and also take into account real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Billings FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Billings? Spectrum is the best internet service provider in Billings. It\u2019s the only cable or fiber provider widely available and offers fast speeds at reasonable prices. A recent speed and price adjustment at Spectrum saw all 300Mbps plans increased to 500Mbps -- for the same price of $50 a month. Now you can choose between 500Mbps for $50 monthly or 1,000Mbps for $70 monthly. The main downside with Spectrum is that prices increase significantly after two years.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Billings? Yes, fiber internet is available to 32% of Billings residents, according to FCC data. TDS Telecom is the primary fiber provider in the area, but Quantum Fiber also has some coverage in southwest Billings.\n\nWho is the cheapest internet provider in Billings? TDS Telecom is the cheapest internet provider in Billings, with plans starting at $40 a month for 600Mbps speeds.",

            "content": "The bull market has sent the S&P 500 up 23% over the last year. But this run has brought the average yield of the index down to just 1.24% -- the lowest yield since 2000.\n\nInvestors looking to boost their yield in the new year can find compelling choices in retail and telecommunications. Here are two solid dividend payers that can help you increase your passive income.\n\n1. Target\n\nRising inflation and interest rates have taken a toll on many retail companies. Leaders like Walmart and Costco have handled the headwinds well and have seen their share prices soar, but they also don't pay a high dividend yield and currently trade at expensive valuations. Target's (TGT 0.19%) 3.24% forward dividend yield and modest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio offer much better value that could lead to excellent returns.\n\nTarget enjoys similar levels of scale as other big-box stores. It generates $107 billion of trailing revenue from nearly 2,000 stores and e-commerce. The company has paid a dividend since 1967, illustrating its resiliency through economic cycles.\n\nDespite a weak consumer spending backdrop, Target still reported a 2.4% year-over-year increase in traffic last quarter. But customers just aren't spending as much, as noted by a meager 0.3% increase in comparable sales.\n\nHowever, the stock's forward P/E of 16 looks more reasonable than that of its competitors that trade at much higher earnings multiples. Combined with the high yield, investors are getting solid value in the shares right now.\n\nMoreover, investors might see a small expansion in the valuation multiple once consumer spending improves. Target is seeing strong growth from its same-day delivery program, which could lead to more sales opportunities over the long term.\n\nThe quarterly dividend payment is $1.12, up from $1.10 a year ago. On an annual basis, that comes to 52% of Target's earnings, providing plenty of wiggle room to grow the dividend in 2025 and beyond.\n\n2. Verizon Communications\n\nInvesting in top wireless service providers can be a great way to boost passive income. Telecoms are slow-growing businesses, but the regular fees customers pay for services like internet and wireless connectivity allow Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%) to generate consistent cash flow and pay generous dividends.\n\nVerizon, including its subsidiaries, has paid a dividend since 1984. It raised the quarterly dividend in 2024 by 1.8% to $0.6775, bringing the forward dividend yield to 6.99%.\n\nThe stock is down 28% over the last three years, as investors need a higher yield to compensate for the higher interest rates offered by long-term bonds. Wall Street is also worried about the impact of a possible recession on Verizon's revenue growth.\n\nStill, Verizon turned in a solid Q3 earnings report in October. Wireless servce revenue grew 2.7% over the year-ago quarter, with a net addition of 239,000 postpaid phone subscribers. It also reported the ninth consecutive quarter of 375,000 or more broadband additions. Management reported that new products like myPlan and myHome are resonating well with customers.\n\nA potential slowdown in new subscribers seems already priced into the stock's valuation. Even if revenue growth slows, investors will still see more dividends. Verizon is only paying out 58% of its adjusted earnings in dividends. It should be able to sustain and grow its dividend over the long term.\n\nWhile you won't earn monster returns with Target or Verizon, these are solid dividend stocks that might pay you for the rest of your life.",

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Bloomington\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When it comes to selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds, and also take into account real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Bloomington FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Bloomington, Indiana?

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the Federal Communication Commission. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Wilmington\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there: We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answers to those questions are often layered and complex, the providers that come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.).\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Wilmington FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Wilmington? AT&T Fiber is the best internet service provider in Wilmington due to its fast, symmetrical speeds, favorable service terms (free equipment, unlimited data, no contracts) and record of high customer satisfaction. Spectrum is a close second to AT&T Fiber in Wilmington. The area\u2019s largest cable internet provider is available to more local households than AT&T Fiber and has a lower starting price of $30 to $50 per month. Spectrum\u2019s affordable plans also offer faster maximum download speeds than similarly priced plans from AT&T Fiber, 500Mbps compared to 300Mbps.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Wilmington? Yes. Around a third of Wilmington addresses are wired for fiber internet service, according to the most recent FCC data. Coverage is greatest in the South Oleander, Princess Place and Pine Valley Estates neighborhoods, but fiber service can be found in random areas throughout the city. AT&T Fiber is Wilmington's largest and essentially only fiber internet provider.\n\nWho is the cheapest internet provider in Wilmington? Spectrum, T-Mobile Home Internet, US Cellular and Verizon 5G Home Internet all have plans starting at $50 a month. Spectrum offers the fastest download speeds, up to 1000Mbps. Equipment rental, although optional, will add $10 to your monthly bill with Spectrum, whereas T-Mobile Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet include equipment rental at no extra cost.",

But this year, the telecoms giant has undertaken a bold initiative designed to \u201cbring all of the magic of the Super Bowl to fans across the country.\u201d\n\nFanFest brings the beloved event to 30 NFL cities across the U.S., employing venues such as MetLife Stadium, SoFi Stadium, Nissan Stadium, Empower Field at Mile High Stadium.\n\nFans can experience free celebrations on Super Bowl Sunday with local foods, beverages, player meet-and-greets, live music and more. So, at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, Rams legend Marshall Faulk and other NFL alumni, Rams cheerleaders, team mascot Rampage and more, will be on hand. And DJ Infared and The Mariachi Rams will musically get the crowd amped.\n\nPlay\n\nMuse huddled with Nick Kelly, head of partnerships at Verizon, to discuss the nationwide blitz:\n\nMUSE: How long have you had a relationship with the NFL?\n\nNick Kelly: Verizon has been an official partner of the NFL since 2010, providing connectivity at many of the NFL stadiums, the private network for coach-to-coach communications and activations throughout the season. Last year during Super Bowl LVIII, we exclusively took over Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s Comedy Club as a \u201cVerizon Live\u201d space, providing customers with unique experiences and exclusive access to special events with NFL players, celebrity talent and music artists. We also ran Super Bowl ads in the English and Spanish-language broadcasts featuring Beyonc\u00e9 and J Balvin. The campaign showcased the power of Verizon\u2019s 5G network and aligned with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s album drop.\n\nDo you also have an in-game ads this year?\n\nAdvertising in the Super Bowl is an incredible opportunity to reach large-scale audiences nationally. We\u2019ve done it in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future. Our goal this year, however, is to create something truly ambitious\u2014national in scope, yet deeply rooted in local communities, so the storytelling we\u2019ll be doing is on the local level. We\u2019re dedicating all of our focus and energy to delivering 30 simultaneous experiences that are not only exceptional but also tell unique, localized stories in ways we\u2019ve never done before.\n\nCan you talk about the challenges of putting this together, as there are numerous activations, and at the national level?\n\nCoordinating activations across all 30 NFL markets required strong collaboration with our local partners. From securing venues to working with small businesses and NFL legends, there are a lot of moving parts. Every market is unique, with its own set of logistical and cultural nuances, which meant we had to take a highly customized approach. But that\u2019s what makes it so exciting. It\u2019s not just a one-size-fits-all initiative. The goal is to create something that feels meaningful and personal to fans in every city.\n\nWhy is experiential critical for advertisers, and how does will FanFest move the needle?\n\nExperiential marketing is about creating meaningful moments that resonate. Fans want to feel connected to the brands they engage with. By integrating local elements, we\u2019ve made sure each FanFest feels authentic to the community.\n\nAt the same time, the breadth of this initiative is unparalleled. We\u2019re connecting with fans in ways that matter to them, whether it\u2019s on the 50-yard line of their favorite stadium or through exclusive meet-and-greets. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that a brand like Verizon can deliver both national impact and hyper-local relevance. That balance is critical when every market has its own identity and culture.\n\n(Which brand will take home the 2025 Super Clio for the best Big Game commercial? We\u2019ll find out on Feb. 10.)",

The contract is part of the Air Force\u2019s so-called \u2018offer-to-lease\u2019 (OTL) programme to upgrade critical comms infrastructure. Verizon said it represents its \u201cseventh OTL win in eight attempts\u201d, and follows parallel OTL contracts in 2019, 2021 and 2023, meaning it is engaged in OTL upgrades at 36-odd (\u201cthree dozen\u201d) Air Force bases.\n\nThis includes a major standalone 5G (5G SA) network deployment at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. The new contract covers installations at Air Force bases in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Washington DC, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. In total, Verizon is delivering 5G and other wireless network services across 72 bases in the US, it said.\n\nIts 5G portfolio with the federal government, and the US Department of Defense specifically, is strong, it noted. The focus is on \u201chigher speeds, increased bandwidth, and lower latency for base personnel and surrounding communities\u201d, it said. Maggie Hallbach, senior vice president for public sector business at Verizon, said: \u201cThis is [our] seventh OTL win out of eight attempts, which serves as a testament to the trust the Air Force has in\u2026 our network, as well as the quality of the professional and managed services expertise they gain from our people.\u201d\n\nThe new infrastructure will help the Armed Forces in the US to pursue \u201cstrategic digital transformation priorities\u201d. These include supporting flight line test equipment, \u201canimated\u201d (AR/VR) simulation and training, \u201cfull-motion and high-definition\u201d video for telemedicine for airmen, and AI for biometric identification. In January last year, Verizon won a $1 million deal to provide 5G coverage to the Army Garrison Hawaii\u2019s Helemano Military Reservation via a newly constructed cell tower (\u2018Dragon Tower\u2019) to serve military families, personnel, and visitors.\n\nIn June last year, the Department of Homeland Security awarded Verizon Business a 10-year deal, valued at $176 million, to provide a government emergency telecoms service (GETS) and wireless priority service (WPS). The contract, first awarded in 1993, makes Verizon a strategic partner to improve mission-critical comms systems for national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) efforts, it said. First responders from federal, state, and local public safety agencies can also access Verizon\u2019s WPS through its Verizon Frontline network for first responders.\n\nLast May, the Department of the Navy (DON) selected Verizon Business to provide wireless devices and services (\u201cvoice, data, IoT and mobility management\u201d) as part of a \u201cmultiple award contract\u201d worth up to $2.67 billion over 10 years.

            "content": "A developer is planning a new apartment complex with 180 units across seven buildings on the former Verizon site along East Empire Street in Bloomington. If approved, construction could start later this year in a community starved for more housing.\n\nThe Holladay Properties project is planned for 1312 E. Empire St., on about 7.5 acres just east of Towanda Avenue. The 180 apartments would be a mix of 94 one-bedroom and 86 two-bedroom units. They\u2019re described as upscale apartments with amenities, including two green space areas as well as a dog park.\n\nHolladay has been looking at Bloomington for a potential project for about two years, said development manager Mike Doyle. They landed on the Empire Street property in part because it\u2019s a centrally located infill site, he said. He praised the staff at the City of Bloomington and Bloomington-Normal Economic Development Council for being \u201cexceptionally helpful\u201d in advancing the project. It\u2019s unclear what incentives will be offered.\n\n\u201cWe believe there is a need for housing (in Bloomington),\u201d Doyle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to do our part to meet the right folks and learn the community, versus just show up and stick a flag in the ground.\u201d\n\nDoyle said Holladay has a lot of experience these types of high-end apartment communities. They tend to include resident amenities like a community club room and fitness rooms. They tend to be pet-friendly, often with a dog park area and pet-wash station. While plans for Bloomington are still conceptual, Holladay is considering \u201cZoom rooms\u201d (shared work-from-home rooms) and \u201ccreate studios,\u201d another shared space for arts and crafts projects and other uses.\n\nHolladay is a large commercial real estate company based in South Bend, Indiana, with nearly $1 billion in owned property and over 275 employees in 25 locations around the country. Chicago is one of its main locations.\n\nFacing a housing shortage, Bloomington-Normal has seen several housing projects get announced but never come to fruition in the last few years. Doyle said that\u2019s happening in other communities too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very fortunate that even during these trying times, we\u2019ve been able to get projects launched,\u201d he said.\n\nDoyle said Holladay has two advantages that help keep projects moving. The company\u2019s Chicago office has a sister construction company that often serves as general contractor for its projects. That helps Holladay \u201chave a much tighter grasp on construction prices\u201d as they fluctuate, Doyle said.\n\nAnd Holladay itself has been around for 73 years, with a track record that\u2019s built trust, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little easier for us than perhaps some other folks who haven\u2019t been around as long to raise the equity needed for these projects. We have investors and folks who are willing to put their money into our projects because they know we do what we\u2019ll say we\u2019re gonna do. We followed through in the past,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cAnd on the debt side, because we\u2019ve been in business for so long, because we\u2019ve been a really good partner with the partner banks we work with, we have a pretty steady stable of lenders who are eager and excited to work with us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what city incentives or redevelopment agreement will be offered to Holladay. Doyle said one of the most common structures is Tax-Increment Financing, or TIF, in which you freeze the base layer of property taxes with any increases above that rebated to the developer or used for special projects within that area. That property already appears to be inside Bloomington\u2019s existing Empire Street Corridor TIF District, which was established in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt has been our experience with the last few projects we launched that some form of incentive is necessary really to get us the minimum-return threshold that we need to attract the investors we need to make these projects go,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cOur philosophy with any sort of incentive conversation is, it\u2019s frankly easier if you don\u2019t need it. We really only want to ask for what we absolutely need. It\u2019s all just a math problem.\u201d\n\nMcLean County Museum of History / Courtesy The GTE building on East Empire Street in Bloomington, seen here in October 1975. The building was later demolished, and the property could soon be redeveloped into an apartment complex.\n\nThe property at 1312 E. Empire St. was formerly home to a large office building which opened in 1958. It was home to the GTE State Office and later Verizon. It closed in 2007 and later demolished. It's been a vacant lot for several years.\n\nVehicular access to the new apartment complex would be provided via three curb cuts along the south Frontage Road and one curb cut along Robinhood Lane. In all, 331 total parking spaces would be provided on site (surface and enclosed).\n\nThe Holladay project will go before the Bloomington Zoning Board of Appeals for a special use permit (since the property is zoned for office use) during a meeting at 4 p.m. Jan. 15. It\u2019s possible the project will go before the full Bloomington City Council at its Feb. 10 meeting, Doyle said.\n\nHolladay hopes construction can begin this year, as soon as late summer or early fall, and take about 20-22 months. That means the project could be completed by mid-2027 at the earliest.",

My family and I moved from T\u00fcrkiye to Rochester, New York.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f How did you end up in Rochester, specifically?\n\nThis was before the internet, so we literally knew one other person from our hometown who moved there. We made a couple of long-distance calls to him and we were on our way!\n\n\ud83e\udea1 You eventually found community?\n\nWe were happy to find a thriving T\u00fcrkish community. As an undergraduate, I took a class in ethnic geography and learned that after World War II, there were two prominent textile factories in Rochester that needed skilled tailors. So, from the 1960s - 1980s, they heavily recruited from T\u00fcrkiye, Greece and Northern Africa.\n\n\ud83d\udcbc I understand you had some interesting jobs prior to Verizon.\n\nI once taught at a community college without intending to do so.

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Verizon is buying AOL for about $4.4 billion, advancing the telecom\u2019s push in both mobile and advertising fields.\n\nThe acquisition gives Verizon an entry into increasingly competitive online and mobile video. The New York company is the country\u2019s largest wireless carrier as well as an Internet and TV provider \u2014 and wireless video and targeted advertising is seen as the next battleground for customers.\n\nThe move comes as the media landscape is increasingly being disrupted on several fronts as more TV watchers stream shows online and through their smartphones and tablets. AOL offers an advertising sales and display network that made it an acquisition target.\n\n\u201cAOL\u2019s focus on unifying the advertising experience across display, video, mobile and TV makes it an attractive asset because advertisers are looking for better ways to reach their audience across screens,\u201d said Lauren Fisher, analyst at eMarketer. \u201cCoupled with Verizon\u2019s existing mobile (and streaming video) presence, the companies\u2019 combined ad offerings mean massive cross-screen reach with much richer audience data.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, companies like Verizon and Google are looking to connect together the video and other content viewers want, the digital \u201cpipes\u201d that deliver the content and the advertising networks that support it.\n\nVerizon said last month that it was preparing to launch a video service over the summer for mobile devices. It also recently began offering various levels of cable service rather than one big cable package, which has been the norm.\n\nThat has put Verizon at odds with major content companies like ESPN as it sees more customers cut the cord in favor of video that is streamed online.\n\nVerizon will gain access to AOL\u2019s advanced advertising technology, including its \u201cOne by AOL\u201d integrated platform. AOL reported a 7 percent boost in revenue during its first quarter, mainly on strong global advertising sales.\n\nIt also gains control over significant AOL content, including cultural and political website The Huffington Post, and also TechCrunch. AOL is the nation\u2019s fourth-largest online property with about 200 million monthly consumers of its premium brands, according to its website.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. will pay $50 in cash for each share of AOL Inc., also based in New York, a 15 percent premium to its closing price on Monday.\n\n\u201cVerizon\u2019s vision is to provide customers with a premium digital experience based on a global multiscreen network platform,\u201d said chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam in a printed statement.\n\nThe deal is expected to close this summer. Tim Armstrong, AOL chairman and CEO, will continue to lead that company.\n\nVerizon has 108.6 million wireless customers, 5.7 million FiOS video subscribers and 6.7 million Internet subscribers. It operates in 150 countries.\n\nDuring its most recent quarter, it saw wireless subscribers grow by 4.8 percent, while FiOS Internet customers grew 36 percent. FiOS cable customers grew 58 percent.\n\nAOL has evolved since its early days as an Internet company with the familiar phrase \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail.\u201d It started out as Quantum Computer Services in 1985 and was renamed America Online in 1991. By 1996, it reached 5 million members.\n\nAs AOL grew larger, it began to make acquisitions. It purchased CompuServe and ICQ in 1998 and Moviefone and Netscape the next year. In 2000, it acquired MapQuest. A year after the MapQuest purchase, AOL merged with Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner. The deal with Time Warner would come to be considered one of the most disastrous business combinations in history after failing to gel.\n\nThe company changed its name from America Online to AOL during that time. In 2009 AOL was spun off from Time Warner, becoming an independent, publicly traded company.",

            "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Verizon Communications (VZ), which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis largest U.S. cellphone carrier has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 0.86%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Verizon was expected to post earnings of $1.18 per share, but it reported $1.19 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.85%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.14 per share, while it actually produced $1.15 per share, a surprise of 0.88%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Verizon. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nVerizon currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.05%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on January 24, 2025.\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.",

Samsung also favored Google Messages on its new flagships over its own Samsung Messages. Google's messaging app is already quite capable and is equipped with all the features people have come to love from alternatives.Now, Android Authority was able to find Google isn't stopping where everyone else is. The chat app will get even better with upcoming MLS encryption support, which will mark its next step toward end-to-end encryption interoperability across apps and platforms.Back in 2023, Google announced support for Messaging Layer Security (MLS) encryption as a new standard for ensuring end-to-end encryption remains in place across apps and platforms. Google Messages is working on incorporating the standard for RCS to finally enable safe, secure, and encrypted interoperability.The folks at Android Authority were able to switch on MLS encryption within Google Messages in a one-on-one conversation but were unsuccessful so far with enabling it for group chats (yet). Hints in the code of Google Messages v20250106 beta also indicate the MLS encryption protocol.Currently, this encryption protocol is not publicly available. Google is still laying the groundwork for it, and it would be the next step for Google Messages.MLS is a protocol for end-to-end encryption, designed to offer security for one-on-one chats as well as group chats. Right now, if both you and the person you're texting are using Google Messages, your messages would be end-to-end encrypted thanks to RCS.However, MLS would level up RCS and ensure interoperability, meaning you'd be able to chat with people using other apps such as Samsung Messages or others and still know your messages are safe and secure. This means that when apps transition to the MLS protocol, we'll have standardized encryption messaging, where you can communicate securely regardless of the app or platform you're using.Encryption ensures that your messages cannot be intercepted by malicious users.Also, with the adoption of MLS, group chats will finally enjoy the same robust encryption as one-on-one chats. With this, RCS would become a true competitor to proprietary encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp, iMessage, and Signal. To put it simply - it's a step towards Google Messages world domination, if you will.As we're seeingand even Samsung transition to Google Messages, the app seems in an ideal position to throw a big challenge to rivals.",

They agreed to pay $100 million.\n\nCustomers who were charged those administrative fees between Jan. 1, 2016, and Nov. 8, 2023, were eligible to file a claim. The deadline to file was April 15, 2024.\n\nThe payments under that settlement are now being made.\n\nWhy are customers angry?\n\nThe payouts are a joke.\n\nOriginally, customers were told they could expect to be paid up to $100 depending on how long they were a customer and how long they paid the fees.\n\nThe settlement website still lists that as a possibility, but it does not appear anyone got anywhere close to that amount.\n\nPeople have started posting on social media about the payouts they received. Most are between $3 and $15.\n\nThe money is being deposited directly into customer bank accounts.\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\nNope.\n\nUnfortunately, this is common when companies settle large class action lawsuits.\n\nThe initial number may seem large, but it rarely ends with a windfall to customers who have been wronged.\n\nAttorneys are entitled to between 25% and 35% of the settlement, and maybe more, depending on the complexity of the case. (A judge decides this).\n\nThere are administrative fees and other costs associated with actually making the payments, and the actually pool of money to be paid to the plaintiffs in cases like these are often reduced by nearly 50%.\n\nFurther impacting settlement amounts is how many people are eligible for payment and how many file a claim.\n\nAll of these factors have impacted the payouts in the Verizon case and customers have no recourse to claim a larger share of the money.\n\n12 rules to live by in New Jersey Gallery Credit: Dennis Malloy\n\nPOP QUIZ: Can you guess these NJ landmarks from Google Earth images?

In anticipation of the evolving landscape of mobile consumption, where video calls are replacing traditional voice calls, streaming dominates entertainment, gaming has moved to the cloud, and factories are running their operations on 5G private networks, Verizon engineers are pushing the boundaries of mobile technology. Using carrier aggregation and Verizon\u2019s 5G virtualized technology, engineers recently achieved 5.5 Gbps download speeds. That\u2019s the equivalent of downloading 266 Taylor Swift albums a minute or streaming 3,056 Hulu episodes per hour.\n\n\u201cCustomers expect the gold standard from Verizon and we work every day to do even better for them,\u201d said Adam Koeppe, Senior Vice President of Technology Planning at Verizon. \u201cOur goal is to provide cutting-edge solutions our customers need to thrive in today\u2019s changing world. We will continue to push the boundaries of our technology and drive innovation in our industry so our customers know they are always a step ahead of what\u2019s next simply by being a Verizon customer.\u201d\n\nVerizon, along with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and MediaTek, demonstrated 5G speeds of 5.5 gigabits per second in a 5G lab environment. Using carrier aggregation, a technology that combines multiple channels of both FDD and TDD spectrum bands to provide greater efficiency for data sessions transmitting over the wireless network, the companies combined six separate channels of sub 6 GHz spectrum to achieve this multi-gigabit speed in the downlink.\n\nThe need for continued acceleration of enhancements on mobile networks has never been more evident. Mobile data traffic is expected to grow more than fourfold by 2030, reaching over 5,400 exabytes, and customers are doing more on mobile networks than ever before. By driving technological advancements, Verizon engineers are addressing the evolving needs of consumers and business customers as mobile connectivity evolves to power every aspect of their lives.\n\nAbout this trial\n\nThis recent proof of concept was conducted in a lab and aggregated 350 MHz of PCS, 850 MHz, AWS, CBRS and C-band spectrum. Using Samsung\u2019s virtualized RAN (vRAN) solution and MediaTek\u2019s next-gen connectivity platform featuring 6CC technology, the trial ran 5G data through Samsung\u2019s 5G Standalone core, and demonstrated how the next generation of devices with this evolving technology will enable new use cases and drive innovation in mobility.\n\nVirtualization is essential in next-generation network evolution that delivers higher speeds and lower latency. Using virtualization in the RAN allows Verizon to effectively manage its network and rapidly accommodate its customers\u2019 varying needs by offering greater flexibility in resource allocation and enabling higher throughput speeds.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be part of this industry-leading achievement alongside Verizon and MediaTek, bringing increased performance and greater possibilities to consumer devices,\u201d said Alok Shah, Vice President of Strategy, Business Development and Marketing, Networks Business, Samsung Electronics America. \u201cAs the vRAN market leader, Samsung has long been harnessing the power of virtualization and 5G to elevate networks around the globe. 5G Standalone adds exciting potential to the mix, including enhanced scalability and flexibility, helping operators like Verizon make their network vision a reality. \u201d\n\n\u201cAchieving 5.5 Gbps peak download speeds in collaboration with Verizon and Samsung is a testament to our innovative spirit and technical expertise, and not only highlights the potential of our next-generation chipset but also sets the stage for new and exciting use cases in the 5G era,\u201d said Dr. HC Hwang, General Manager of Wireless Communication Systems and Partnerships at MediaTek. \u201cWe will continue driving advancements that will empower consumers and businesses with unparalleled connectivity and performance.\u201d\n\nAbout Verizon\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $136.8 billion in 2022. The company offers data, video and voice services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms, delivering on customers\u2019 demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.\n\nMEDIA CONTACT:\n\nKaren Schulz\n\n864.561.1527\n\nKaren.schulz@verizonwireless.com",

The settlement agreement said that each valid claim would receive a minimum of $15, plus $1 for every month of service the payee was a Verizon customer and paid the challenged administration fee. The reality fell a little short.\n\nA screenshot from an email announcing a payment deposit for a Verizon class action lawsuit settlement Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2025.\n\nSome customers got as much as $14.81 deposited to their PayPal or Venmo accounts.

The base payment, after dividing the funds among the number of applicants, may have been significantly lower than the initial $15, with the additional dollar a year of service for some recipients bringing their payments up.\n\nApplicable taxes and any fees charged by the payment services each applicant specified when they filed may also affect the total.\n\nAnother possible factor? Last year Reuters reported that the plaintiff's lawyers in the lawsuit were requesting $33 million in fees.\n\nWhat was Verizon sued for?\n\nAccording to the class action lawsuit, plaintiffs said that Verizon's \"administrative charge\" was not disclosed in the plan's advertised monthly fee and they were charged in a \u201cdeceptive and unfair manner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVerizon has denied the claims, saying in a statement that the company \u201cclearly identifies and describes its wireless consumer admin charge multiple times during the sales transaction, as well as in its marketing, contracts and billing.\u201d\n\nIn the settlement to resolve the lawsuit (actually a combination of four lawsuits), the company denied all wrongdoing and pans to continue to charge the administrative charge but agreed to pay $100 million to affected customers who submitted a claim.\n\nHowever, as part of this settlement, Verizon will amend its Customer Agreement to include revised Administrative Charge disclosures.\n\nWhat is a class action lawsuit?\n\nUSA TODAY explains that a class action lawsuit involves one or more people suing on behalf of themselves and others with similar claims. Once a class action lawsuit is approved, every member of the class is awarded, with the exception of anyone who opts out of the group.\n\nWho was eligible for a payment from the Verizon settlement?

The Verizon Air Force deal extends the public 5G and private 5G networks that have already been rolled out in 14 military bases by major operators in 2024.\n\nThe 35 new Air Force bases covered with 4G or 5G include Cape Canaveral, Eglin, Vandenberg and many others. \u201cSome installations where 5G service is already operational include Luke Air Force Base (Arizona), Tyndall Air Force Base (Florida), Dobbins Air Reserve Base (Georgia), Moody Air Force Base (Georgia), Robins Air Force Base (Georgia), Grissom Air Reserve Base (Indiana), Minneapolis-St Paul Air Reserve Station (Minnesota), Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station (New York) and Shaw Air Force Base (South Carolina),\u201d SNS\u2019s Khan noted in an email, referencing the firm\u2019s existing military base communications report.\n\nSo, are these networks a public 5G extension or a private 5G network? Many could be considered a public-private combination, Khan said. \u201cWhile many may view this simply as an expansion of mobile operator RAN coverage, it could also be considered a hybrid public-private 5G implementation, with the potential to prioritize traffic and process data locally via on-premise user plane functionality for security-sensitive or time-critical use cases in work centers, training areas and along flightlines,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the DoD is continuing with its military 5G push in 2025, we\u2019ll see how further hybrid public-private 5G deployments happen over the course of the year.",

            "content": "Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky once said that part of his greatness was because \"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.\" In other words, his precise ability to anticipate the next move set him apart from the pack. The ability to anticipate and predict secular trends is also an incredible tool for investors. For instance, if you predicted that online shopping would explode back when the internet was still relatively new and bought $10,000 worth of Amazon stock at its IPO, you could have $22 million today.\n\nInvestors have turned to Verizon Wireless (VZ -0.32%) for years, looking for quality returns, and the results haven't been good recently. Actually, its total return over the past five years is abysmal compared to that of the S&P 500 index, as shown below.\n\nMany people invest in Verizon for its dividend yield, which currently stands at 6.8%, so it's important to note that the total return charted above includes dividends. Verizon's growth is stalled, and 2024 hasn't been great through the third quarter; cash flow, earnings per share, and operating income are all down year over year, debt is up, and revenue is essentially flat. It's time to look at stocks of the future. Here is a suggestion.\n\nCritical trends to boost Airbnb\n\nShort-term rentals, also called vacation rentals, booked through Airbnb (ABNB 2.92%) have significant long-term tailwinds. The largest is simple demographics. Roughly 36% of Airbnb users are aged 25 to 34. For comparison, only 7% are 55 to 64 years, and only 5% over age 65. The implications of this are massive. As the younger folks age, become more established in their careers, and accumulate wealth, they will become a larger portion of vacationers, driving the vacation rental market.\n\nNext, the total market size is forecast to increase from $100 billion in 2024 to $125 billion in 2029, giving Airbnb a growing market to capture. The company reported revenue of $11 billion over the past 12 months, so there is much room to grow. Finally, as shown below, the number of users should skyrocket over the next several years.\n\nAirbnb's business model is terrific because it creates immense free cash flow. Free cash flow is essentially the money left after all expenses and capital investments for equipment (known as capex) are made. This goes into the company's pocket to fund growth and reward shareholders. Airbnb pocketed $4.1 billion of its $11 billion in sales over the past 12 months for an excellent 38% margin. Verizon's margin was just 10% over this time because its business isn't as efficient and has significant capex needs. The preferable business model should drive Airbnb's valuation higher over time.\n\nWhat about the dividend?\n\nYet there is more than one way to achieve a goal -- and I know there is more than one way to return cash to shareholders. Dividends are one, and share buybacks are another. Companies buy back their own stock to reduce the number of outstanding shares, making each share represent a larger portion of the pie. Buybacks can also increase earnings per share, increasing the stock price, with all else equal.\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) prolifically repurchase stock, and shareholders have benefited wildly. Airbnb repurchased $1.1 billion in shares in Q3 2024 and $3.3 billion, 4% of the current market cap, over that trailing 12 months. Given Airbnb's excellent free cash flow, buybacks will likely continue in earnest.\n\nSome people prefer dividends since they receive cash upfront, but I prefer buybacks. First, shareholders pay taxes annually on dividends but not on buybacks. Second, buybacks give the company maneuverability. It can increase and decrease them strategically with little fanfare. Companies can't usually cut dividends because they negatively affect stock prices -- it's big news! This means companies pay and even raise dividends when it isn't the best move for the company.\n\nAirbnb's current market cap is $82 billion, compared to Verizon's at $169 billion; however, they have been headed in different directions since 2023, as you can see below.\n\nIf Airbnb rides its tailwinds to 15% annual growth and Verizon continues to tread water or lose ground, Airbnb will be worth more in about five years, and its shareholders will reap the rewards.\n\nI recognize that some investors can't afford to lose their dividend income, so click here to read about a couple of dividend-paying alternatives to Verizon as well.",

            "content": "Enterprises are hungry. Appetites for digital transformation are reaching a new intensity, brought on in part by excitement around paradigm-shifting tools like generative AI. This enthusiasm is inspiring enterprises to be bolder with their technology roadmaps and strategies in general, lest they miss out on the opportunity to innovate, improve offerings to customers and drive new revenue.\n\nThe current enthusiasm might seem sudden, but it\u2019s converging with a run-up that\u2019s been in motion for years. As head of 5G Acceleration \u2013 the Verizon Business division in charge of market development for private 5G, edge compute and the associated tech ecosystem \u2013 I\u2019ve been completely immersed in it. Here\u2019s how I see it the market for dedicated wireless networks advancing in the next 12 months.\n\nState of play\n\nArtley \u2013 richer IT/OT strategies\n\nIn 2023, my team and I spent a significant amount of time on market seeding and education around what private 5G and its ecosystem can do to improve customer operations. In 2024, those conversations heated up, and we saw our funnel explode triple digits with new business. Now, as we move into 2025, networks are coming on line and the pipeline continues to grow.\n\nThe combination of expanded customer understanding and the previously mentioned hunger for tech-driven transformation has led to richer conversations about IT strategy. We can spend less time talking about the platform and more time discussing the customer\u2019s desired business outcomes. These are promising, growth-minded conversations that encompass applications, devices, and the full technology ecosystem that powers modern enterprise.\n\nThis is the fun stuff \u2013 which brings me to my core 2025 prediction.\n\nMomentum drivers\n\n2025 is the year that private wireless moves from the margins of the industry to the mainstream, alongside mobility, fixed-wireless, cloud and broadband. But private wireless itself is just the tip of the spear. The neutral-host network product we introduced this year quickly became one of the most significant momentum drivers we\u2019ve seen in the wireless infrastructure space so far.\n\nThe timing was perfect: neutral-host architecture was emerging as a convenient, cost- and space-efficient alternative to DAS, and because it uses lots of the same componentry as private wireless networks, it presents a simple but powerful value proposition when paired with private 5G as a combined solution. The two go together perfectly both in terms of technological compatibility and the unique customer needs each can cover.\n\nThe neutral host network covers employees, retail shoppers, and visitors with macro-network connectivity, while the private network handles connectivity for industrial or mission-critical operations requiring heightened security, high bandwidth, and low latency. This framework will continue to gain momentum in the marketplace, and, increasingly, customers will want to layer on more use cases.\n\nEnterprise flexibility\n\nOne of the most significant trends among enterprises is the shift in focus from cost efficiencies to innovation and revenue growth. The combination of private and neutral host networks plays into this perfectly because customers can develop unique workflows for general connectivity (neutral host) and advanced, mission-critical use cases (private wireless). One side need not cannibalize the other when it comes to operational planning, which helps straighten the path toward testing or operationalizing new applications.\n\nBusiness-as-usual connectivity and high-tech bets don\u2019t interfere with each other. In fact, they don\u2019t even need to share a timeline, let alone a wireless core. A customer can start with neutral-host connectivity via the macro network and still install a dormant private core, lighting up that private core when they\u2019re ready. This cares for near-term efficiencies and foundational connectivity needs via neutral host without rushing more complicated, data-intensive workloads that belong on a private network.\n\nIncreasingly we\u2019re hearing from customers who want to start with macro connectivity, build pathways to engage cloud-based solutions, and then engage that private core for edge-based capabilities and co-innovation over a longer period of time, layering on new devices and applications organically. The neutral-host plus private-wireless combination facilitates this approach. The flexibility is unprecedented, the platform is powerful, and the value proposition is highly attractive as part of a digital transformation strategy for 2025.\n\nService provision\n\nAnother key trend is the growing demand for streamlined, turnkey solutions without compromising on the above-mentioned capability and flexibility. Enterprises are increasingly looking for partners who can provide comprehensive solutions that encompass everything from core network engineering to in-building wiring and powering. This shift is driven by the recognition that a fragmented approach to deployment often leads to delays, inefficiencies, and suboptimal outcomes.\n\nAs a result, service providers who can offer a more integrated and holistic approach will be well-positioned to capture market share. That desire for turnkey solutioning is also fueled by the expanding richness of the technological ecosystem. While new technologies, devices and applications are exciting, integrating them can come with a steep learning curve. Customers need partners who can help them navigate this complexity, remove friction points, and deliver solutions that are tailored to their needs and desired outcomes.\n\nThat means the role of service providers must continue to evolve. We are becoming trusted advisors and strategic partners in addition to providers. We need to be able to work closely with our customers to understand their unique challenges and opportunities, and then provide infrastructure that can help them realize specific outcomes. That includes working with device manufacturers to optimize their hardware for Industry 4.0 use cases and developing IoT platforms and capabilities to help integrate those devices into customer networks.\n\nIt\u2019s a process that requires a deep understanding of technology, the customer\u2019s industry, and their operational models, all while moving quickly and adapting to changing market conditions.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nTaking private wireless mainstream is a matter of balancing customers\u2019 elevated tech ambitions with platform flexibility and ease-of-use. As enterprises become more comfortable with and knowledgeable about cutting-edge wireless infrastructure, the natural next step is to layer on exciting new devices and applications. That means service providers must be ready to develop and integrate new ecosystem components, accommodate scale, and remove complexity from deployment and management.\n\nI predict we\u2019ll see a heightened emphasis on APIs, self-service, and other tools that empower IT teams to do more with their innovation platforms and essential infrastructure, with less effort. Customers can focus on business outcomes and worry less about whether their infrastructure can accommodate their plans. The next 12 months will constitute a tremendous opportunity for those who are prepared to embrace change.\n\nCustomers and service providers who work together to calibrate networks for capability, flexibility, and seamless integration will be best positioned to succeed.",

You can check your AT&T privacy settings by logging into your account and going to Profile followed by Privacy Choices.\n\nThe carrier has four main privacy toggles:\n\nPersonalized Plus: This setting \"uses data like web browsing and precise location for customization\" including for offers and ads. This data includes your precise location, web browsing, viewership history, apps as well as data AT&T collects from advertisers like demographic information, ZIP code and age ranges.

Share or sell my personal information: This lets AT&T \"share limited information to create, deliver and measure advertisements for things you might like\" including targeted ads. This is on by default.\n\nOf the four, you can easily toggle off all settings, though I would recommend keeping identity verification on for all lines on your account.\n\nThere is also an option for \"automated messages\" that allows the carrier to contact you \"by phone or text with important non-marketing information about your AT&T services like install and repair appointments, billing and account information.\" It's on by default and I would recommend keeping it on as well.\n\nT-Mobile\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nT-Mobile's privacy options are a bit more varied. To access the company's Privacy Center, log into your T-Mobile account and then click My account in the upper right corner, followed by Profile. From there scroll all the way to the bottom and select privacy and notifications and privacy dashboard.\n\nFrom there you will see the following:\n\nShare data for public and scientific research: T-Mobile says that this option allows it to \"help support research initiatives for the public good, such as pandemic response and the development of new technologies.\" Created last year, the carrier says this program is in response to requests from \"outside researchers or researching institutions.\" T-Mobile says this data will be \"de-identified as much as possible before being shared\" and will not include personal information such as your name, though it can share location, demographic and usage data. It also says that data shared here won't be given to law enforcement.\n\n\n\nT-Mobile says that this option allows it to \"help support research initiatives for the public good, such as pandemic response and the development of new technologies.\" Created last year, the carrier says this program is in response to requests from \"outside researchers or researching institutions.\" T-Mobile says this data will be \"de-identified as much as possible before being shared\" and will not include personal information such as your name, though it can share location, demographic and usage data.

The company notes on its site that it still may share \"some personal information with our service providers so you can, for example, receive products and services from us.\" In an annoying extra step, the carrier notes on its website that you can limit what data third-party advertisers share with T-Mobile through its Magenta Advertising Platform, but to opt out of that you need to download a separate app.\n\nOf these options, I would recommend turning all of them off.\n\nIn addition to the dashboard, T-Mobile's Privacy Center website details something called \"phone privacy.\" T-Mobile says that it uses information gathered from here to \"identify offers for T-Mobile calling plans, protect against fraud and respond to emergencies\" but that under this policy it is not collecting \"your name, address, phone number or the content of your phone calls.\" It also says it's not sharing this data with other companies so that it could \"help them market their stuff.\"\n\nVerizon\n\n\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nLike T-Mobile, Verizon has a host of different options when it comes to privacy. This can be found by logging in, clicking on account then account overview.

            "content": "Switching wireless providers isn't easy. Although there are three major networks in the US, the actual number of wireless carriers and plans is significantly higher. Sifting through this big, confusing mess can be overwhelming especially when you are thinking of switching providers after your carrier raised the rate on your older plan.\n\nWe want to help make this process a little easier. Here's how to choose a cellphone plan in 2025.\n\nWhich network works best for you?\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nIn the US there are three major networks: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. All three offer services directly and have robust nationwide networks that offer 4G LTE (fast) and 5G (really fast) data.\n\nThe most important aspect of choosing a network is finding one that works in your area. This makes it hard for us to give a blanket recommendation of any one carrier. For example, T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but if you're in rural Iowa, Verizon is more reliable.\n\nWhile your mileage may vary, the good news is that these networks are growing and improving all the time, particularly as the three major players continue to try and blanket the US with 5G. It's quite possible that a decade ago you left a network complaining about its sparse service, but now it has beefed itself up because of that arms race to acquire customers.\n\nIf you know any friends or family in your area that already use the carrier you're considering, ask about their experience. You could also go to a carrier's store and see if they offer any free ways to try out the service before switching over, such as T-Mobile's Network Pass which lets you sample T-Mobile's service for free for three months. Verizon offers a similar 30-day \"trial\" program while AT&T has recently introduced its own 30-day eSIM free trial option for sampling its network.\n\nThen, of course, there are the plans themselves. Below is a comparison of some of the latest plans from AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. For this chart, we focused on each carrier's cheapest plan, as well as their respective \"middle\" options that we think could make sense for most people.\n\nIt is worth noting that some plans, like T-Mobile's Go5G include streaming perks like Netflix while Verizon lets you add perks like the Disney Bundle (Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu) for $10 per month if you have its latest Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate plans.\n\nMost Verizon and AT&T unlimited plans (with the notable exception being AT&T's Value Plus VL) also don't require you to have every line on the same plan, so if only one of your family plan's lines needs extra hotspot data, you can drop the others down to cheaper options and save a little.\n\nIf you're looking for multiple lines on T-Mobile and its cheapest rate, you're better off going with its regular Essentials or Essentials Saver plans. A promotion the carrier is doing has it available for $100 per month for four lines.\n\nWireless plans compared Plan Total data Cost for one line (with AutoPay) 5G High-speed hotspot Cost for four lines (with AutoPay) T-Mobile Essentials Saver Unlimited $50 Yes Yes (but at \"3G speeds\") $120 T-Mobile Essentials Unlimited $60 Yes Yes (but at \"3G speeds\") $100 AT&T Value Plus VL Unlimited $51 Yes No $124 Verizon Unlimited Welcome Unlimited $65 Yes (5G Nationwide only) No $120 T-Mobile Go5G Unlimited $70 Yes 15GB per line $140 AT&T Unlimited Extra EL Unlimited $76 Yes 30GB per line $164 Verizon Unlimited Plus Unlimited $80 Yes 30GB per line $180\n\nKnow the smaller and prepaid players\n\nVisible, Google Fi and Mint Mobile are just a few of the many MVNOs that rely on larger networks. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nWhile AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon operate the major networks, other smaller providers offer service on their airwaves. First, there are the prepaid brands each carrier owns. Verizon has Visible, AT&T has Cricket and T-Mobile has Metro and now Mint Mobile. All use their parent's respective networks for service.\n\nSmaller players also rely on the larger networks for service. Google Fi, for example, uses T-Mobile's network, while cable companies Comcast and Spectrum rely on Verizon for their respective Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile brands.\n\nBoost Mobile, which is owned by Dish, uses a combination of T-Mobile and AT&T while Dish builds out its own 5G network. Dish has started offering its own service that rivals the big carriers under the Boost brand.\n\nThe benefit of these smaller carriers -- many of which are known as mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs -- is that you can get access to the larger provider's service at a more affordable rate. If you found that Verizon works best where you live but its service is too pricey, switching to Visible, Spectrum Mobile or Xfinity Mobile could potentially allow you to keep similar coverage but pay a bit less (although you may lose out on some other perks like free streaming services).\n\nWe've broken down a few of these providers, including which provider uses which network and explained some of the trade-offs you'll want to keep in mind.\n\nKnow how much you owe on your installment plan\n\nGetting a new iPhone at a deep discount from a carrier often requires a big commitment. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nTwo-year contracts have largely disappeared from the US wireless market. Unfortunately, they now seem set to be replaced by increasingly longer installment plans.\n\nAT&T and Verizon now consistently only offer 36-month installment plans for the latest devices from Apple, Google and Samsung. T-Mobile, meanwhile, still has options for 24-month installments with plans like its Go5G Plus offering better upgrade deals every two years and Go5G Next offering deals every year.\n\nWith these longer timelines you can get a flagship phone for significantly less, but you need to stay on that carrier (and potentially with a pricier unlimited plan) for two or three years. If you leave before that time has passed, you risk needing to pay out the balance owed on the phone, which some providers require before they \"unlock\" the device to be used on other networks.\n\nMajor carriers often offer several hundred dollars when you switch, which can help subsidize the price of the change. You'll want to check your account online or go into your carrier's store to find out how much you might still owe on your phone before you leave.\n\nDecide if you should keep your current phone\n\nThe modernization of phones and networks means your existing phone will probably work just fine on a new carrier. All the major wireless carriers offer a similar assortment of the latest devices, particularly when it comes to the iPhone and the Galaxy lines.\n\nTo make the most of any switch you'll probably want to take this opportunity to upgrade your device, particularly if it's a few years old and lacks modern features like 5G. There are often extra deals when adding or opening a new line to help pay off any installment plan or get you to a better device.\n\nIf you'd rather keep what you have, your existing device will probably work just fine so long as it's unlocked from your previous provider.\n\nKnow your discounts\n\nKeep in mind that all of the carriers offer additional savings, which you could be eligible for depending on your employer, military status, student status or even age. If you're on a family plan, a family member could qualify even if you don't.\n\nFirst responders, military members, veterans, nurses and teachers can get discounts from every major carrier. Verizon offers discounts for students and those in a range of professions, while T-Mobile's Work Perks could knock 15% off Go5G Plus or Go5G Next plans and AT&T offers a similar program for its Unlimited Premium PL and Elite plans that it calls Signature.\n\nIf you're 55 or older, you may also be eligible for a discounted plan: T-Mobile offers discounted plans nationwide for as low as $55 a month for two lines, while Verizon and AT&T offer similar options but only for Florida residents.\n\nWe break down the discounts in greater detail here, for AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile.\n\nThis could save you money if you switch, or potentially lower your current rate a bit and save you the hassle of changing providers.\n\nUnderstand the perks\n\nIf you have the right Verizon plan you could get free Disney Plus. Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nMany of the major carriers bundle in perks for using their higher-end unlimited plans, particularly streaming services. Verizon offers the Disney Bundle (Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus) as a $10 monthly perk for its latest unlimited plans while T-Mobile offers Netflix Standard (with ads) on its Go5G branded offerings and also includes a subscription to Apple TV Plus and Hulu (with ads) with Go5G Next.\n\nEven prepaid and smaller carriers like Cricket (HBO Max with Ads) and US Mobile (a variety of options) offer perks with some of their unlimited plans.\n\nIn addition, Verizon has perks for services including Apple One, Walmart Plus and a Netflix/Max bundle while T-Mobile's Go5G plans also offer in-flight Wi-Fi and unlimited data abroad. T-Mobile's Metro offers 100GB of Google One storage and one-year subscriptions to ViX Premium with some of its Unlimited and Metro Flex plans, with its Metro Flex Plus adding in a subscription to Amazon Prime. AT&T, meanwhile, gives six months of free gaming with an extended trial of Nvidia's GeForce Ultimate.\n\nIf you're already paying for one or more of these subscriptions, switching to the right provider could be a way to help you save even more.",

The events are anticipated to collectively draw around 150,000.\n\nManning, who was a New York Giants quarterback, called the cross-country experiences the \u201clargest simultaneous Super Bowl party ever.\u201d He believes the idea can succeed, likening the Super Bowl\u2019s broad appeal to the spirit of a national holiday.\n\n\u201cThis is a chance to give fans a unique way to enjoy the whole day,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the game. It\u2019s music, food, having things for kids and families. It\u2019s about enjoying the experience while watching the game.\u201d\n\nSome of the local entertainment includes the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 Mariachi band and the Houston Texans Gameday presentation team along with appearances in select cities from deejays such as DJ Infared, DJ Jay Ejercito and DJ Split Second Sound.\n\nAttendees will be able to take a selfie from the 50-yard line, spike a football in the end zone, take a tour of the locker rooms, enjoy tailgate games and participate in football-themed activities on the field. Fans will have field and stadium access at MetLife, SoFi, Nissan Stadium, Empower Field at Mile High and at other NFL sites.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking through \u2018How do we create something that\u2019s truly once-in-a-lifetime?\u2019\u201d said Leslie Berland, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Verizon. She said the company began developing the experience in September, collaborating closely with the NFL and its teams.\n\n\u201cRelatively, few people get to experience the Super Bowl live in stadium,\u201d Berland said. \u201cWe wanted to do something that\u2019s absolutely never been done before and bring that magic of the Super Bowl to fans across the country.\u201d\n\nFor colder climate cities like Chicago and New York, those in attendance will have the option to keep warm in either the stadium\u2019s premium or field club lounge areas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all slightly different depending on market, but we definitely took weather into account,\u201d said Nick Kelly, head of partnerships at Verizon.\n\nManning said the players are excited to take part in this experience, giving them the ability to reconnect with the city where they became football icons. Around 120 players are expected to attend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for them to be a part of something special,\u201d he said. \u201cThis involves great players, and they get to be in their local city with fans who love the game of football. It\u2019s special. It\u2019s unique.\u201d",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence has been a hot market throughout 2024. AI fueled the surge in share price for companies such as Nvidia, which saw its stock rise nearly 180% over the past year through Dec. 31.\n\nThe AI market's growth isn't slowing down any time soon. Forecasts estimate the industry will expand at a phenomenal rate, from $184 billion in 2024 to over $826 billion by 2030.\n\nA great way to capitalize on the AI boom is to invest in companies that are not only involved in artificial intelligence, but also pay a robust, dependable dividend. That said, not all dividend-paying AI stocks are equal. For instance, Nvidia offers a dividend, but its dividend yield is a paltry 0.03% as of this writing.\n\nSo where are the AI companies with great dividends? Three of them are International Business Machines (IBM 1.04%), Cisco Systems (CSCO 1.39%), and Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%). Here's a deeper look into each.\n\nIBM's compelling qualities\n\nIBM offers many reasons to invest in its stock. Shareholders get an impressive dividend yield of 3% , and payments are as reliable as you can hope to see. The company has paid quarterly dividends continuously since 1916 and has increased payments for the past 29 years.\n\nIBM smartly switched its focus to cloud computing and AI in 2020. After AI demand took off in 2023, IBM has enjoyed rising revenue.\n\nIBM's third-quarter sales related to generative AI rose by over $1 billion from the second quarter. This performance demonstrates strong demand for Big Blue's AI offerings.\n\nThe company's future looks bright as well. IBM is working on quantum computing, which uses subatomic particles to perform calculations at unimaginable speeds on the world's most powerful supercomputers. If Big Blue can successfully scale up its quantum capabilities, it could deliver more advanced AI than any available today.\n\nThe case for Cisco\n\nCisco made its name in computer networking, and that discipline is more essential than ever in the AI era. AI systems need the computing power of many computers networked together to crunch the mountains of data required for AI to function. And to deploy that AI to customers requires resilient, dependable, and secure internet networks.\n\nThese are all areas Cisco is known for, and it contributed to the 20% year-over-year rise in the company's product orders in its fiscal first quarter, ended Oct. 26. This strong start to its fiscal year led the company to forecast its 2025 revenue to come in between $55.3 billion and $56.3 billion, up from 2024's $53.8 billion.\n\nCEO Chuck Robbins sees AI powering Cisco's sales growth. He noted that businesses are investing in IT infrastructure to support the demands of AI systems. As a result, the company is integrating its Cisco Silicon One platform into all of its products. Silicon One is the company's custom semiconductor chip designed to deliver superior speed and efficiency to support AI.\n\nIn addition, the stock offers a dividend with a yield of nearly 3%. Cisco has raised its dividend consistently for over a decade.\n\nVerizon's AI offerings\n\nVerizon's involvement in AI is related to edge computing, which entails bringing AI to your devices, whether that be your mobile phone, laptop, or internet-enabled car. These devices are on the periphery, or edge, of a computer network, hence the name.\n\nTo implement edge computing requires a wireless network robust enough to handle a large data load with speed and security. That's where Verizon's 5G network comes in. The telecom partnered with Nvidia specifically to enable the use of AI on its network.\n\nThis capability is coming in 2025, but Verizon's wireless service is already experiencing success. In Q3, its wireless service business saw sales rise 3% year over year to $19.8 billion. This division contributed the bulk of the telecom's Q3 revenue of $33.3 billion.\n\nVerizon is a great dividend stock as well. Because nearly everyone has a cell phone these days, the company can reliably generate substantial free cash flow (FCF) to fund its dividend. Through the first three quarters of 2024, the company produced $14.5 billion in FCF, nearly the same as 2023's $14.6 billion, which illustrates its FCF consistency.\n\nBecause of its strong FCF, Verizon has raised dividend payments for 18 consecutive years. In addition, its dividend yield is nearly a whopping 7% as of this writing.\n\nWith the AI market's growth delivering a tailwind to IBM, Cisco, and Verizon, combined with their outsize dividend yields, these companies are a great way to see a return on your AI investment. And you can collect passive income as the AI market grows over time.",

The bills piled up quickly, and I knew I needed to find a better solution for future trips abroad.\n\nIn 2021, I made the switch to T-Mobile and haven\u2019t looked back since. Not only are T-Mobile\u2019s unlimited plans more affordable than Verizon\u2019s, they also come with several travel-friendly perks that are hard to beat. Here\u2019s a closer look at those benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverview of T-Mobile Plans\n\nOf all T-Mobile\u2019s plans, frequent travelers should pay close attention to Go5G Plus or Go5G Next in particular. These plans include unlimited data in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, unlimited Wi-Fi on major domestic airlines, and up to 5GB of high-speed data in over 200 countries (with speeds reduced to 256 Kbps afterward).\n\nPricing starts at $95 per month for Go5G Plus and $105 per month for Go5G Next, with discounts available for multiple lines. Additionally, you can save $5 per line by enrolling in auto pay, though payment must be made via debit card or bank account \u2014 not a credit card.\n\nI personally don\u2019t enroll in auto pay and instead use The Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express, which I find to be one of the best cards for paying cell phone bills thanks to its long list of benefits. By enrolling, I can receive up to $10 in monthly statement credits when I use my card to pay for wireless phone services from a U.S. carrier, including T-Mobile. Additionally, I benefit from complimentary cell phone protection against damage and theft, which makes skipping the auto pay discount worth it to me.\n\nELEVATED OFFER Terms Apply / Rates & Fees The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express U.P.

This ongoing promotion pays you up to $800 on your eligible phone on the remaining device payment balance by switching from carriers like AT&T, Verizon, Xfinity, and more.\n\n1. Free Wi-Fi When Flying\n\nT-Mobile provides complimentary inflight Wi-Fi, texting, and streaming on Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines for Go5G customers. These inflight Wi-Fi partnerships give T-Mobile a significant edge over other wireless carriers.\n\nWith the Go5G Next and Go5G Plus plans, customers enjoy unlimited Wi-Fi and texting for the entire flight, while the standard Go5G plan includes up to 4 full inflight Wi-Fi sessions per year and 1 hour of free Wi-Fi on all other flights thereafter. For frequent travelers, upgrading to Go5G Next or Go5G Plus is worthwhile for this benefit alone.\n\nYour number will be verified upon connecting to Wi-Fi. Image Credit: T-Mobile\n\nThis complimentary Wi-Fi perk is available on 100% of domestic flights with these airlines with Intelsat, Viasat, Thales, and Panasonic systems, according to T-Mobile. To access it, simply switch your phone to airplane mode and connect to the airline\u2019s Wi-Fi. You\u2019ll be redirected to a portal where you can log in using your T-Mobile phone number, and you\u2019ll receive a verification code to complete the connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Unlimited International Data\n\nI travel internationally several times a year, though most trips typically last about a week or less. However, in 2023, I spent nearly 3 weeks in Japan and South Korea, and I was grateful to have a T-Mobile plan by then, which made staying connected much simpler.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible to buy a new SIM card for international data, I found it much more convenient to stick with my T-Mobile plan. The Go5G Plus and Next Plans provide up to 5GB of 5G data and unlimited texting in over 200 countries per billing cycle. During my 3-week trip, I came close to hitting the 5GB limit but didn\u2019t feel the need to strictly conserve the data I was using on my phone day by day.\n\nEven if you exceed the 5GB limit, you still have unlimited data, though speeds slow to 256 Kbps. For longer trips, I always recommend using Wi-Fi when available. T-Mobile also offers reasonably priced additional data options:\n\n24-hour pass (512MB): $5\n\n$5 10-day pass (5GB): $35\n\n$35 30-day pass (15GB): $50\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that international calls cost 25 cents per minute (except in Canada or Mexico, where it\u2019s actually free!) so I generally avoid making phone calls while traveling. However, if unlimited international calling is important to you, you can add it to your T-Mobile plan for an additional $15 per month.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I had been a Verizon customer for over a decade, and their international data rates are significantly higher. Verizon\u2019s TravelPass costs $5 per day in Canada and Mexico and $10 per day elsewhere. Although it offers unlimited data, calls, and texts, only the first 2GB each day is at high speeds; after that, you\u2019re limited to 3G speeds.\n\nIn essence, you can save a lot of money and avoid the hassle with T-Mobile\u2019s plans, eliminating the worry of paying $10 per day for data. It may not be the best option if you\u2019re a nomad or a long-term traveler, but T-Mobile is perfect for my 3 or 4 international escapades every year.\n\n3. Other T-Mobile Benefits You Didn\u2019t Realize You Have\n\nWhile inflight Wi-Fi and international data are the main reasons I stay loyal to T-Mobile, the phone carrier offers several travel perks that you may not even realize you have.\n\nEvery Tuesday, the company\u2019s T-Mobile Tuesdays offer rotating perks and deals. Some weeks are better than others, but I\u2019ve taken advantage of $2 movie tickets, free Shake Shack burgers, $25 off Zappos orders (with no minimums), and more.\n\nT-Mobile customers can also enroll in a complimentary AAA membership for 1 year, which saves you $65. This can be especially useful for road trips and driving in general, as it provides access to 24/7 roadside assistance in the U.S.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nT-Mobile has made it much easier for my family and me to stay connected while traveling, and at an affordable rate. I\u2019ve found that the data speeds abroad are reliable, and the free inflight Wi-Fi on my phone saves me at least a few dollars every time I fly.\n\nFor the cell phone protection benefit of The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, coverage for a stolen or damaged eligible cellular wireless telephone is subject to the terms, conditions, exclusions and limits of liability of this benefit. The maximum liability is $800, per claim, per eligible card account. Each claim is subject to a $50 deductible. Coverage is limited to two (2) claims per eligible card account per 12 month period. Eligibility and benefit level varies by Card. Terms, conditions and limitations apply. Please visit americanexpress.com/benefitsguide for more details.

Verizon is launching a nationwide FanFest that will offer free celebrations on Super Bowl Sunday at stadiums and venues across all 30 NFL markets.\n\nWhile each location will have its own local draws, attendees at Verizon Super Bowl FanFest will be able to watch the Big Game, meet hometown NFL legends and players, and enjoy entertainment from team cheerleaders, local artists, djs and live bands, such as the Mariachi Rams and Houston Texans Gameday Presentation Team. Each event will feature tailgate games and food prepared by local chefs, including chef Stacey Weber, who oversees culinary operations for the Arizona Cardinals, and chef Rocco Whalen, owner of Fahrenheit Restaurants.\n\nAt MetLife, SoFi and Nissan Stadiums and other select locations, football enthusiasts will get \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d venue access, with the opportunity to stand on the 50-yard line, snap a selfie at themed photo ops, spike a ball in the end zone, tour locker rooms and take part in on-field experiences. Exclusive team memorabilia will be available for purchase in select cities.\n\n\u201cSuper Bowl LIX is the most anticipated sporting event of the year, but few get to experience it in person; we wanted to bring that collective excitement and energy to fans across the country with once-in-a-lifetime access they\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Leslie Berland, evp and cmo at Verizon, said in a statement. \u201cVerizon is the only brand that can do something like this; we\u2019re leveraging the power of our sponsorships, national and local partnerships across the country to put our customers at the center of this incredible event.\u201d\n\nVerizon customers can score tickets to FanFest on a first-come, first-served basis on a microsite and bring a select number of guests.

            "content": "Three Verizon Communications Inc. retirees are suing their former employer, along with fiduciary State Street Global Advisors, for transferring pension plan liabilities to two allegedly \u201crisky\u201d insurance companies.\n\nThe retirees filed the pension risk transfer complaint on December 30, 2024, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that Verizon and SSGA violated their fiduciary duties when they chose to transfer $5.9 billion in pension liabilities to group annuity contracts with Prudential Financial Inc. and Reinsurance Group of America Inc. The transactions, which closed in March 2024, transferred the payment of benefits for 56,000 retirees.\n\nDempsey et al. v. Verizon Communications Inc. et al. claims that Verizon and SSGA chose the \u201ccheapest available\u201d annuities, as opposed to the \u201csafest available,\u201d which is the standard set by the Department of Labor\u2019s Interpretive Bulletin 95-1. The plaintiffs are being represented by Edward Stone Law P.C., which also has filed other PRT-related lawsuits, including one against SSGA and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n\n\u201cThe combination of unique risks posed by the Verizon/[Prudential]/RGA transaction is contrary to the best interests of the impacted Verizon retirees, and has resulted in less secure pension benefits for those retirees,\u201d the plaintiffs allege in the complaint. \u201cThe Verizon retirees have now been transformed into certificate holders under risky group annuities that are no longer regulated by ERISA or insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u2018PBGC\u2019). As a consequence, impacted retirees are quite rightly fearful and concerned about their futures, the fate of their retirements, and the financial well-being of their beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nContinuing Trend\n\nThe lawsuit is the most recent in a spate of filings over the past year targeting the choice of annuity provider as jeopardizing the retirement savings of participants in employer-sponsored defined benefit plans.\n\nMany of those lawsuits targeted PRT transactions done with Athene Annuity Life & Co., including those by General Electric Co., AT&T Inc. and Lockheed Martin. Athene has not been named as a defendant in those cases and has shot back against claims, calling them \u201cbaseless\u201d and driven by \u201cattorneys who are attempting to enrich themselves.\u201d\n\nNeither Prudential nor RGA were named as defendants in the Verizon lawsuit, and neither immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe plaintiffs also allege that State Street, which was hired by Verizon as an independent fiduciary, \u201cdirectly profited\u201d from the PRT transaction through common stock holdings in Verizon, Prudential and RGA.\n\n\u201cState Street failed to act solely in the interests of the Plan Participants as required under ERISA,\u201d the complaint alleges. \u201cRather, State Street\u2019s own financial interests were improperly served by off-loading Verizon liabilities to [Prudential] and RGA, and by helping Verizon obtain the cheapest available annuity provider, as opposed to the \u2018safest available\u2019 annuity provider as required by ERISA.\u201dSSGA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nVerizon issued a statement that: \u201cThe lawsuit is completely without merit. Verizon will defend the matter vigorously.\u201d\n\nDominic DeMatties, a partner in Thompson Hine LLP, which represents plan sponsors, did not comment directly on the Verizon lawsuit. But he did note via email that the decision as to whether to transfer pension assets and liabilities to insurance companies is made by the plan sponsor \u201cin its settlor capacity,\u201d which means the decision is not subject to fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and should not be treated as such. Only the selection of the insurance company or companies from which to purchase the contracts is subject to ERISA.\n\n\n\n",

The nationwide celebration will feature on-field access, live music, local chefs and meet-and-greets at each location with current and former NFL players such as Marshall Faulk, Jason Witten, Tiki Barber, Derrick Brooks and Thurman Thomas.\n\n\u201cThis is a new way for fans to enjoy the Super Bowl\u201d said Eli Manning, a two-time Super Bowl MVP and Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist, who will serve as a FanFest ambassador. Verizon customers can claim free tickets on a first-come, first-served basis starting Friday by visiting VerizonFanFest.com, with an option to bring guests to their city\u2019s experience. The events are anticipated to collectively draw around 150,000.\n\nManning, who was a New York Giants quarterback, called the cross-country experiences the \u201clargest simultaneous Super Bowl party ever.\u201d He believes the idea can succeed, likening the Super Bowl\u2019s broad appeal to the spirit of a national holiday.\n\n\u201cThis is a chance to give fans a unique way to enjoy the whole day,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the game. It\u2019s music, food, having things for kids and families. It\u2019s about enjoying the experience while watching the game.\u201d\n\nSome of the local entertainment includes the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 Mariachi band and the Houston Texans Gameday presentation team along with appearances in select cities from deejays such as DJ Infared, DJ Jay Ejercito and DJ Split Second Sound.\n\nAttendees will be able to take a selfie from the 50-yard line, spike a football in the end zone, take a tour of the locker rooms, enjoy tailgate games and participate in football-themed activities on the field. Fans will have field and stadium access at MetLife, SoFi, Nissan Stadium, Empower Field at Mile High and at other NFL sites.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking through \u2018How do we create something that\u2019s truly once-in-a-lifetime?\u2019\u201d said Leslie Berland, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Verizon. She said the company began developing the experience in September, collaborating closely with the NFL and its teams.\n\n\u201cRelatively, few people get to experience the Super Bowl live in stadium,\u201d Berland said. \u201cWe wanted to do something that\u2019s absolutely never been done before and bring that magic of the Super Bowl to fans across the country.\u201d\n\nFor colder climate cities like Chicago and New York, those in attendance will have the option to keep warm in either the stadium\u2019s premium or field club lounge areas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all slightly different depending on market, but we definitely took weather into account,\u201d said Nick Kelly, head of partnerships at Verizon.\n\nManning said the players are excited to take part in this experience, giving them the ability to reconnect with the city where they became football icons. Around 120 players are expected to attend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for them to be a part of something special,\u201d he said. \u201cThis involves great players, and they get to be in their local city with fans who love the game of football.

            "content": "Three Verizon Communications Inc. retirees are suing their former employer, along with fiduciary State Street Global Advisors, for transferring pension plan liabilities to two allegedly \u201crisky\u201d insurance companies.\n\nThe retirees filed the pension risk transfer complaint on December 30, 2024, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that Verizon and SSGA violated their fiduciary duties when they chose to transfer $5.9 billion in pension liabilities to group annuity contracts with Prudential Financial Inc. and Reinsurance Group of America Inc. The transactions, which closed in March 2024, transferred the payment of benefits for 56,000 retirees.\n\nDempsey et al. v. Verizon Communications Inc. et al. claims that Verizon and SSGA chose the \u201ccheapest available\u201d annuities, as opposed to the \u201csafest available,\u201d which is the standard set by the Department of Labor\u2019s Interpretive Bulletin 95-1. The plaintiffs are being represented by Edward Stone Law P.C., which also has filed other PRT-related lawsuits, including one against SSGA and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n\n\u201cThe combination of unique risks posed by the Verizon/[Prudential]/RGA transaction is contrary to the best interests of the impacted Verizon retirees, and has resulted in less secure pension benefits for those retirees,\u201d the plaintiffs allege in the complaint. \u201cThe Verizon retirees have now been transformed into certificate holders under risky group annuities that are no longer regulated by ERISA or insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u2018PBGC\u2019). As a consequence, impacted retirees are quite rightly fearful and concerned about their futures, the fate of their retirements, and the financial well-being of their beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nContinuing Trend\n\nThe lawsuit is the most recent in a spate of filings over the past year targeting the choice of annuity provider as jeopardizing the retirement savings of participants in employer-sponsored defined benefit plans.\n\nMany of those lawsuits targeted PRT transactions done with Athene Annuity Life & Co., including those by General Electric Co., AT&T Inc. and Lockheed Martin. Athene has not been named as a defendant in those cases and has shot back against claims, calling them \u201cbaseless\u201d and driven by \u201cattorneys who are attempting to enrich themselves.\u201d\n\nNeither Prudential nor RGA were named as defendants in the Verizon lawsuit, and RGA did not respond to request for comment.\n\n\u201cIn filing this lawsuit, class action attorneys are attacking the state insurance regulatory system, the health of the entire pension risk transfer industry, and the very retirees whose pension obligations are safeguarded through these transactions,\u201d Dylan Tyson, president, Prudential retirement strategies, said in a statement. \u201cThe class action attorneys show no understanding of reinsurance but nonetheless make unsubstantiated and erroneous allegations. Although Prudential is not a party to the lawsuit, Prudential vehemently denies all allegations made against it in the complaint.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs also allege that State Street, which was hired by Verizon as an independent fiduciary, \u201cdirectly profited\u201d from the PRT transaction through common stock holdings in Verizon, Prudential and RGA.\n\n\u201cState Street failed to act solely in the interests of the Plan Participants as required under ERISA,\u201d the complaint alleges. \u201cRather, State Street\u2019s own financial interests were improperly served by off-loading Verizon liabilities to [Prudential] and RGA, and by helping Verizon obtain the cheapest available annuity provider, as opposed to the \u2018safest available\u2019 annuity provider as required by ERISA.\u201d\n\nSSGA declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nVerizon issued a statement that: \u201cThe lawsuit is completely without merit. Verizon will defend the matter vigorously.\u201d\n\nDominic DeMatties, a partner in Thompson Hine LLP, which represents plan sponsors, did not comment directly on the Verizon lawsuit. But he did note via email that the decision as to whether to transfer pension assets and liabilities to insurance companies is made by the plan sponsor \u201cin its settlor capacity,\u201d which means the decision is not subject to fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and should not be treated as such. Only the selection of the insurance company or companies from which to purchase the contracts is subject to ERISA.\n\n\u201cThese lawsuits, in which plaintiffs include no specific allegation of wrongdoing by the plan fiduciaries in connection with the pension risk transfer but instead allege more generally that a particular insurance company is risky and/or a particular independent fiduciary is conflicted, seem oddly aligned with recent political attacks on the general practice of transferring assets and liabilities from a defined benefit pension plan to an insurance company rather than addressing or remedying any specific harm or loss actually suffered by plan participants and beneficiaries as a result of the transaction,\u201d DeMatties says.\n\nPrudential\u2019s Tyson said in a statement that \u201call of Prudential\u2019s reinsurance transactions are structured and executed in full compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, under the robust oversight of our insurance regulators. Prudential is widely regarded as a safe and secure insurance company and diversified financial services organization, with exceptional financial strength and stability.\u201d\n\nPrevious PRT Complaint Against Verizon Reached Supreme Court\n\nThrough the PRT, Prudential and RGA each now assume about 50% of the transferred pension liabilities, except in some geographic areas where Prudential will take on 100% of the obligations.\n\nIn March 2024, shortly after the PRT was made public, the Association of BellTel Retirees Inc. called for renewed protections of Verizon retirees\u2019 pension assets. The 134,000-member nonprofit advocacy group alleged that Prudential\u2019s dependence on an Arizona-based reinsurance company hides some of its books and records and makes its group annuities less safe for retirees.\n\nThe association sued Verizon in 2012 to try and prevent an $8.4 billion transfer to Prudential of 41,000 retirees\u2019 pension assets. In the lawsuit challenging the PRT\u2019s legality, the plaintiffs received class action status. Appeals in the case eventually went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which remanded it back to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, where it was dismissed in 2016.\n\nERISA attorney DeMatties noted that, from the perspective of a plan sponsor, running a DB plan is an unrelated business in which it must engage and which it must manage. With that backdrop, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in many of these cases \u201cseems to prefer that status quo indefinitely over having a pension plan run by a company whose core business is professionally managing assets in order to pay insurance benefits over an extended period of time\u2014which is exactly what occurs under a traditional defined benefit plan.\u201d\n\nWhether these cases continue to be filed in 2025 will be \u201cheavily dependent on whether any of these complaints survive the motion to dismiss stage,\u201d DeMatties says.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated to include comment from Prudential.",

            "content": "Verizon employees claim they are getting a raw deal in a new pension risk transfer lawsuit.\n\nA group of ex-Verizon employees filed the latest lawsuit challenging the efficacy of insurance companies managing pension funds.\n\nFiled Monday in the Southern District of New York, the Verizon pensioners claim the pension risk transfer (PRT) deal agreed to in March threatens their retirement funds. Verizon inked the $5.9 billion PRT deal for Prudential Financial and Reinsurance Group of America to manage the pensions of 56,000 Verizon retirees and their beneficiaries.\n\nPrudential and RGA agreed to \u201cirrevocably guarantee and assume 50% of the benefit obligation to the retirees, except in certain jurisdictions where Prudential will irrevocably guarantee and assume 100% of the benefit obligation,\u201d a news release said.\n\nThe transaction is the second major PRT deal between Prudential and Verizon. In 2012, Prudential completed an approximately $7.5 billion transfer that covered approximately 41,000 of Verizon\u2019s retirees.\n\nNeither Prudential or RGA is named as a defendant in the new lawsuit. Instead, plaintiffs are suing Verizon, several Verizon groups connected with the pension plan, and State Street Global Advisors Trust Co. State Street served as \u201cthe independent fiduciary\u201d in putting the deal together, the lawsuit says.\n\nBut State Street \u201cwas anything but independent,\u201d claim plaintiffs Maureen Dempsey, Heinz E. Schlenkermann, and Chris Shelton, all ex-Verizon employees.\n\n\u201cState Street directly profited from the annuitization transactions through its common stock holdings in Verizon, Prudential Financial \u2026 and RGA,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cState Street\u2019s own financial interests were improperly served by off-loading Verizon liabilities to PICA and RGA, and by helping Verizon obtain the cheapest available annuity provider, as opposed to the \u2018safest available\u2019 annuity provider as required by ERISA.\u201d\n\nPRT deals surge\n\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is a federal law that sets minimum standards for most private sector retirement and health plans. PRT deals have become big business in recent years, as companies look to offload hefty pension commitments. Meanwhile, insurers and private equity firms crave the chance to invest and reap fees from large pots of pension funds.\n\nIn 2023, PRT deals surged to a record 773. But pensioners say they are caught in the middle and unprotected. Since the start of 2023, Lockheed Martin, GE, AT&T, and Alcoa have been sued by employees in class action lawsuits.\n\nVerizon employees say they are now invested in unwanted and \u201crisky group annuities.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of going through a rigorous, independent and thorough selection process that took into consideration the requisite analysis that an ordinary and prudent ERISA fiduciary is required to undertake, Verizon and State Street chose to purchase substandard annuities for Verizon retirees from PICA and RGA, which are both heavily dependent upon transactions with affiliates that are not transparent and expose plan participants to unreasonable amounts of risk and uncertainty,\u201d plaintiffs claim.\n\nNeither State Street nor Verizon responded to requests for comment.\n\n\u2018Regulation light\u2019\n\nThe lawsuit appears to reference risky offshore reinsurance arrangements that have become commonplace in the life insurance industry. Prudential and RGA are dependent on affiliates domiciled in \u201cregulation light\u201d jurisdictions \u201cwhere wholly owned captive reinsurers and affiliates are permitted to count debt instruments as assets and are not required to file publicly available financial statements in accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles,\u201d plaintiffs note.\n\nPlaintiffs claim that State Street and Verizon \u201cignored obvious red flags\u201d with Prudential and RGA's reliance upon affiliates \u201cwithin the same controlled group.\u201d\n\nThe dangers of risky retirement annuities is not just hypothetical, plaintiffs note. In the 1980s, hundreds of employers replaced their pension plans with retirement annuities from Executive Life Insurance Co. Executive Life had embarked on a disastrous \u201cjunk bond\u201d investment strategy.\n\nThe pension benefits of approximately 84,000 workers and retirees were transferred from the federally regulated pension system to Executive Life, the lawsuit says.\n\n\u201cExecutive Life was often selected by employers because it offered the lowest bid on group annuity contracts,\u201d plaintiffs say. \u201cRather than choose a safer, more expensive annuity, employers placed their own financial interests over plan participants\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nIn 1991, Executive Life became insolvent and pensioners lost billions in valuable retirement funds, the lawsuit notes.\n\n\u00a9 Entire contents copyright 2025 by InsuranceNewsNet.com Inc.

Both Vertical Bridge\u2019s parent company DigitalBridge and global investment company CDPQ, which is a large shareholder in Vertical Bridge, contributed to the financing of the transaction, which company executives described as pivotal for the company\u2019s realization of its long-term strategy.\n\n\u201cThe close of this transaction marks a transformative milestone for Vertical Bridge, solidifying us as the partner of choice in the U.S. communications infrastructure industry. These under-tenanted towers, many in hard-to-site locations, uniquely position us to expand vertical real estate solutions to our customers,\u201d said Bizick in a statement on the closing of the tower deal. \u201cWith the addition of these towers, Vertical Bridge looks forward to growing our partnership with all our tenants.\u201d\n\nVertical Bridge also purchased 226 towers from Shenandoah Telecommunications (Shentel) for $310.3 million in cash earlier this year.",

            "content": "SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2013 The Notre Dame men\u2019s basketball team (7-6, 1-1) will look to unlock the green jersey magic once again when they host the North Carolina Tar Heels (8-6, 1-1) on Saturday, Jan. 4, presented by Verizon. The game will be broadcasted by CBS at Noon ET. The game is officially sold out \u2013 Notre Dame\u2019s first of the season.\n\nND vs UNC\n\nSaturday will mark the 40th meeting between the Irish and Tar Heels. ND trails the overall series 9-30 but has a better mark at home at 4-6. In fact, the Irish have won two of the last three against UNC inside Purcell Pavilion.\n\nSaturday will also mark the second of what will be four Irish Wear Green games this conference season. Notre Dame was successful in its first Green Game, defeating Syracuse on December 7.\n\nLastly, there is an interesting Irish connection in this series. North Carolina\u2019s athletic director Bubba Cunningham earned his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in business administration from Notre Dame in 1984 and 1988, respectively. He\u2019s a former member of the Irish golf team (1982-83) and served as Notre Dame\u2019s associate athletics director for finance and facilities from 1995-2000 and was the associate director of athletics for external affairs from 2000-02. Notre Dame\u2019s athletic director is a former Fighting Irish student-athlete as well. Pete Bevacqua graduated magna cum laude, with a B.A. in English in 1993. He was a walk-on punter for head football coach Lou Holtz.\n\nTHE TAE-KOVER\n\nTae Davis has stepped up and balled out in Markus Burton\u2019s absence, emerging as one of the top talents in the league. Scoring-wise, Davis had the fourth-best December in the ACC, averaging 20.0 ppg last month.\n\nHe\u2019s produced three straight games with 20+ points, averaging 23.7 ppg in that span on 61.5 percent shooting. He\u2019s also averaging 7.7 rebounds and 2.0 assists over those three games. If Tae can go big for two more games, it\u2019ll mark the first time an Irish player has recorded five straight of 20+ since Ben Hansbrough in February of 2011.\n\nLastly, he\u2019s riding a career-best eight straight games in double figures.\n\nPROTECT PURCELL\n\nFor the most part, the Irish have done just that, going 6-1 inside Purcell Pavilion during non-conference play. If it weren\u2019t for the letdown vs. Elon, the Irish could have been looking at 7-0.\n\nThis is their best start at home since the 2021-22 season in which they were a dominant 14-1 inside Purcell and qualified for the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Irish are averaging 80.6 ppg at home on 49.6 percent shooting. They boast a scoring margin at home of +13.4.\n\nThe best individual player at home this year? Braeden Shrewsberry is averaging 18.0 ppg on an impressive 51.8 percent shooting. He\u2019s 41.5 percent from deep. The sophomore has recorded 20+ points in three of his last four home games.\n\nMAKING UP POINTS\n\nBefore Vegas, Burton was the only player in the country averaging 20+ points, 5+ assists, and 5+ rebounds. Now the Irish continue to work together to make up the 20+ points per game lost along with Burton\u2019s ability to create shots for his teammates.\n\nThree players in particular have stepped up to fill the void. Both Tae Davis and Braeden Shrewsberry are posting career highs in both points per game and shooting percentage. Then there\u2019s Matt Allocco who is on pace to have the highest assist-to-turnover ratio in program history.\n\nDavis is averaging 16.6 ppg, which ranks 10th in the ACC. For comparison, Tae averaged 9.2 ppg in his first year with the Irish. He boasts the third-best shooting percentage in the ACC at 53.7 percent. Diving deeper, he\u2019s 51-of-75 (.680) at the rim.\n\nTae has this explosiveness and innate ability to attack the rim like no other on the team. He\u2019s been using that to his advantage and getting to the foul line. He\u2019s averaging 6.9 FD/40 which ranks 27th nationally. The Indy native ranks third in the league in FT attempts and sixth in makes. He\u2019s shooting a career-best 76.5 percent from the stripe.\n\nNext is Braeden Shrewsberry, who is averaging 16.2 ppg (11th in the ACC) on 43.7 percent shooting. His 2.9 threes per game rank second in the league, while his .373 clip from three ranks fifth.\n\nIn particular, Shrewsberry is hot from corner threes this year, knocking down 52.2 percent (12-for-23), which is 17.2 percent above the D1 average.\n\nLast season, he drained 55 three-pointers in conference play which set a new program record for ACC threes. He ultimately hit 78 treys which were second most by a DI freshman.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to point out that he\u2019s added to his overall arsenal. He\u2019s developed a dangerous floater that keeps defenders guessing. Oh you think he\u2019s shooting a three, well he\u2019s gonna pump fake and drive now. He\u2019s shooting 48.4% from the paint and he\u2019s 12-15 around the rim. He\u2019s 52.8 percent overall from two.\n\nLast but not least is grad transfer Matt Allocco. The 6-4 guard is averaging 10.2 ppg on 45.4 percent shooting from the floor and 46.9 percent from beyond the arc. His 3.8 assists per game rank 10th in the ACC.\n\nAllocco owns a 4.1 assist-to-turnover ratio which ranks fifth in the nation and leads all ACC players. It\u2019s obviously way too early for comparisons, BUT, the highest A/TO ratio in program history for a season was 3.16 by Martin Inglesby back in 2000-01.\n\nNOTRE NOTABLES\n\nNotre Dame is shooting 47.2 percent from the field which ranks fourth in the ACC.\n\nA defensive statistic that sticks out is the team\u2019s three-point percentage allowed vs. the average opponent \u2013 .296 which ranks 25th. That\u2019s the best ranking the Irish have had in that category since Haslam Metrics started tracking in 2014.\n\nLast time out, it was the tale of the good and the bad. The bad was the first half. The Irish shot a season low 28.1 percent and faced a 19-point halftime deficit at 24-43. The good was the second half. They scored a season best 51 points in a half on 60.0 percent shooting. Tae Davis scored 22 of his 27 points in the second half. Now, the Irish have to rebound from a tough 75-86 loss at Georgia Tech with UNC on Saturday.\n\nFreshman guard Sir Mohammed made his return from injury in the Georgia Tech game on Dec. 31. He had been out since the second game of the season back on Nov. 11.\n\nJ.R. Konieczny is averaging 10.5 ppg in the two ACC games this year, which is third-best on the team. J.R. is shooting 8-18 (.444) from the floor and 3-7 from three (.429).\n\n\u2014 ND \u2014",

Back in September, news began to break about the Salt Typhoon hacking operation that had reportedly compromised parts of the US telecoms system.\n\nA minimum of nine telecoms firms are believed to have been impacted by Salt Typhoon in the US, with dozens of telecoms businesses in other countries also being affected. While the campaign was publicly acknowledged in recent months, the attacks may have been in operation for more than one year.\n\n\u201cWe detect no activity by nation-state actors in our networks at this time. Based on our current investigation of this attack, the People\u2019s Republic of China targeted a small number of individuals of foreign intelligence interest. In the relatively few instances in which an individual\u2019s information was impacted, we have complied with our notification obligations in cooperation with law enforcement,\u201d said AT&T in a statement.\n\nThe wide scale of the digital attack has seen the Chinese hackers gain access to the geolocation data of potentially millions of people and gain the ability to record phone calls at will, according to a press briefing by The White House. The US Department of Commerce banned the last few remaining China Telecom operations in the US in retaliation for the attacks. The Chinese Government have denied any involvement in the hacking attacks.\n\n\u201cImmediately upon learning of this incident, Verizon took several key actions to protect its customers and its network, including partnering with federal law enforcement and national security agencies, industry partners, and private cybersecurity firms,\u201d said Vandana Venkatesh, chief general officer at Verizon, in a statement.\n\nAT&T Battles with Cybercrime\n\nIn July, AT&T was alleged to have paid hackers \u00a3307,750 ($400,000) to delete all user data stolen in a cyberattack.\n\nA hacker who is believed to be a member of the high-profile ShinyHunters hacking group told WIRED that a ransom payment was made in Bitcoin. Blockchain security business, Chainalysis, investigated the claims and found a transaction to a Bitcoin wallet that matches the ransom timeline.\n\nThe cyberattack occurred from 14 and 15 April, with calling and text message records from over 100 million people impacted. While AT&T has said the content of calls and messages were not stolen, including sensitive personal information, there are fears data from the breach could be used to target victims through social engineering.",

            "content": "In the past year, telecommunication systems have been exposed to critical vulnerabilities, such as hackers accessing sensitive information. This led to an overall mistrust and increased risk to privacy, especially with many big companies falling prey to cyber-attacks. It seems that not only telecommunication networks but also federal authorities are now actively pursuing the breaches and charging strict penalties against them. Now, a 20-year-old U.S. Army soldier has been arrested for being behind major breaches of AT&T and Verizon systems.\n\nA 20-year-old Army soldier has been arrested for his link to hacking activities that compromised the systems of AT&T and Verizon\n\nThere has been an increased number of concerns regarding securing customer data in the telecommunication sector due to major breaches on account of cybersecurity gaps. As per a new report by KrebsonSecurity, a 20-year-old U.S. Army soldier, Cameron John Wagenius, was arrested on December 20th close to an army base in Texas for his link to the Salt Typhoon hacking incident.\n\nIt is reported that even though the indictment documents do not give away any details on the hacking incident, Wagenius's mother, Alicia Roen, let the police know about her son's association with Connor Riley Moucka, who was an accomplice in the cybercrime. Moucka was apprehended back in October over accusations of stealing data from big companies by exploiting vulnerabilities in the cloud data company Snowflake, which these companies relied on for cloud data services. He, along with John Binns, was charged with stealing 50 billion AT&T user's text and call records.\n\nThe stolen data is said to have then been outsourced to other individuals, including John Wagenius. This could be the reason why he could not be directly linked to the serious hacking attempt on AT&T systems. Instead, he is facing charges for obtaining the information unlawfully and attempting to share the records. The arrest also highlights how cybercrime operations tend to work where stolen information is often shared and distributed across multiple networks, raising even deeper concerns regarding data theft and the potential risks it brings about.\n\nIt is further said that the chief research officer, Allison Nixon, played a major role in uncovering the cybercriminals and endured turmoil in the process. AT&T and Verizon faced immense pressure amidst the breach but have now put the concerns to rest by letting the community know about the successful removal of the Salt Typhoon hacking group and that the systems have now been secured.",

            "content": "Federal Communications Commission has released its communications market place report for the year 2024 indicating significant investment in 5G network.\n\nCapex\n\nOver the past five years, mobile wireless service providers have invested nearly $163 billion in their networks, with $30.2 billion reported in 2023, a 22 percent decrease from $38.7 billion in 2022. The three largest providers \u2014 AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon \u2014 combined for an estimated $32.6 billion in 2023, reflecting a decline after steady increases from 2020 to 2022.\n\nIn 2023, these providers allocated 16.1 percent of their revenues to capital expenditures, with AT&T leading at 19 percent, followed by T-Mobile at 15.3 percent and Verizon at 14.2 percent. EchoStar has spent $2.6 billion annually in 2022 and 2023 to develop a facilities-based 5G network, contributing to the rapid deployment of wireless infrastructure, FCC said.\n\nThe major providers constructed their 5G networks 1.5 times faster than their 4G networks. EchoStar projects a $10 billion investment to create the first nationwide cloud-native 5G network, reporting broadband coverage to over 246 million people, or 73 percent of the U.S. population, by mid-2023.\n\n5G coverage\n\nOver the past two years, 5G coverage has significantly expanded, enabling high bandwidth and low latency for applications on a scale and with time sensitivity not achievable with 4G LTE. This growth has driven new streams of research and development in the wireless industry.\n\nBy mid-2024, AT&T reported 5G coverage for over 300 million U.S. consumers across 24,900 cities and towns, T-Mobile covered 330 million people over two million square miles, and Verizon aimed to cover 250 million consumers.\n\nEchoStar, as of mid-2023, covered 70 percent of the U.S. population with 5G. According to FCC data, by December 2023, approximately 97 percent of the U.S. population was covered by at least one 5G provider at speeds of 7/1 Mbps or higher in outdoor stationary environments, with 93 percent covered at speeds of 35/3 Mbps or higher.\n\nMIMO antenna\n\n5G-NR has enabled the adoption of Massive MIMO antenna technology in higher frequency bands, significantly enhancing network capacity, coverage, and user experience. Massive MIMO antennas, with numerous active elements, use beamforming to direct signals to specific users, reducing interference and improving signal quality.\n\nVerizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and EchoStar are actively deploying this technology. Wireless providers have also embraced carrier aggregation, which combines different spectrum channels to improve service quality by enhancing coverage, capacity, and speed. AT&T pioneered two-carrier aggregation for standalone 5G uplinks in 2023, while T-Mobile introduced four-carrier aggregation in mid-2023 and began deploying six-carrier aggregation in early 2024, aiming for speeds exceeding 3.6 Gbps.\n\nInitial 5G deployments primarily used non-standalone architectures, combining 5G radios with an LTE core, allowing seamless switching between 5G and 4G LTE based on application needs and device compatibility. Standalone 5G, featuring a 5G core, has been introduced by T-Mobile, AT&T, and EchoStar in select areas. This architecture offers faster speeds, enhanced coverage through carrier aggregation, support for higher device density, lower latencies, real-time applications, improved security, and enables network slicing. Equipment vendor Spirent anticipates broader deployment of standalone 5G in 2024.\n\nOpen RAN\n\nThe largest Open RAN deployment in the U.S. is EchoStar\u2019s 5G network, which covers 246 million people. Other deployments include Inland Cellular in Idaho and OptimERA in Alaska. In 2023, AT&T announced a $14 billion investment to move 70 percent of its wireless traffic to Open RAN, and in 2024, Verizon reported 130,000 radios supporting Open RAN specifications.\n\nFWA\n\n5G\u2019s enhanced spectral efficiency, achieved through Massive MIMO and beamforming, has made it a viable technology for Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). FWA is more cost-effective and quicker to deploy than other fixed broadband services, and consumers can install antennas themselves. AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and UScellular are offering FWA services using their 5G networks as they compete for fixed broadband customers.\n\nWhile cable and wireline companies lost over 140,000 broadband subscribers in 2023, FWA saw more than 3.6 million net additions. Verizon and T-Mobile together gained over 6.7 million FWA customers in 2022 and 2023, with AT&T having over 200,000 FWA customers by April 2024.\n\nRegional providers like Carolina West Wireless, Cellcom, Cellular One, and Union also use FWA in remote areas, and UScellular is exploring FWA with standalone 5G. In addition, IoT solutions such as Low-Power Wide-Area Networks, Narrowband IoT, and Long Range have emerged, and 5G\u2019s high bandwidth, low latency, and ability to support many devices make it ideal for IoT. Companies like CISCO and TELUS are launching IoT services.\n\nBaburajan Kizhakedath",

            "content": "I would say there are more ways to generate passive income than you can shake a stick at. However, that expression might not be true, depending on how big your stick is and how committed you are to shaking it. Nonetheless, there are lots of ways to make passive income.\n\nBuying dividend stocks is one of the best approaches. If you have a tidy amount of cash to invest and can find stocks with especially juicy dividend yields (and the ability to keep those dividends coming), you can potentially rake in significant passive income. The good news is that it's not hard to find such stocks. Investing $134,800 in these three high-yield dividend stocks could make you $10,000 in reliable passive income in 2025.\n\n1. Ares Capital\n\nAres Capital (ARCC 1.53%) is the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC). As a BDC, Ares provides financing primarily to middle-market businesses with market caps between $100 million and $1 billion. It has roughly $464 billion in assets under management, and over half of its assets are first-lien senior secured notes.\n\nBDCs must return at least 90% of their earnings to shareholders as dividends to be exempt from federal income taxes, so their dividend yields tend to be quite high. Ares Capital is no exception with its forward dividend yield of 8.72%. If you invested one-third of an initial $134,800 (around $44,933), you would receive passive income of nearly $3,919 in 2025.\n\nWhile there's always a risk that a given company could cut its dividend, I think Ares Capital's dividend is solid. CFO Scott Lem pointed out in the company's Q3 update, \"Our conservative approach to investing and funding our balance sheet have enabled us to pay a stable to growing regular quarterly dividend for our shareholders for over 15 years.\"\n\nThe traditional middle market presents a $3 trillion market opportunity. The addressable liquid credit market for companies with annual revenue of more than $1 billion adds another $2.4 trillion to Ares Capital's total addressable market. With more companies turning to direct lending because of its convenience and speed of execution, I expect Ares Capital's business will continue to grow -- and its dividends will continue to flow.\n\n2. Enterprise Products Partners\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (EPD 1.88%) ranks among the biggest midstream energy companies in the U.S. It operates over 50,000 miles of pipeline that transport natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals. The company's other midstream assets include 42 natural gas processing trains, 26 fractionators, and facilities that can store over 300 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons.\n\nInvesting in limited partnerships (LPs), such as Enterprise Products Partners, comes with some extra tax filing hassles. However, I think the trouble is worth it, as Enterprise offers a forward distribution yield of 6.76%. One-third of your initial $134,800 would provide a little over $3,037 in annual income.\n\nI'll bet that your actual passive income in 2025 will be even higher. Why? Enterprise Products Partners has increased its distribution for 26 consecutive years. The chances look very good that the company will extend that streak this year.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners' business is recession-resistant. Its revenue isn't impacted much by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Around 90% of its long-term contracts include inflation-protection provisions. Unsurprisingly, Enterprise has been able to generate strong cash flow per unit during both good times and bad times for the energy sector.\n\n3. Verizon Communications\n\nMost investors are probably already familiar with Verizon Communications (VZ -0.32%). The company is a telecommunications giant serving millions of consumers and businesses (including nearly all of the Fortune 500).\n\nVerizon has been popular with income investors for years -- and still is, with its ultra-high forward dividend yield of 6.79%. If you invested the final one-third of an initial $134,800 in the stock, you should receive roughly $3,051 in annual income. That brings your total passive income for 2025 with these three stocks to a little over $10,000.\n\nI suspect Verizon could make that total somewhat higher, though. The company has increased its dividend for 18 consecutive years. My hunch is that 2025 will up the count to 19.\n\nCould Verizon's pending acquisition of Frontier Communications negatively impact its ability to fund the dividend? I don't think so. Verizon expects the deal will immediately boost its revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).",

Mike Watters-Imagn Images\n\nOn Wednesday, Optimum subscribers flipping to MSG \u2013 which also broadcasts Islanders and Devils games \u2013 were greeted with a blue screen telling them: \u201cMSG Networks is no longer available on your TV lineup.\u201d\n\nThe Altice-owned cable operator went on to tout a QR code and a web address that offer \u201coptions to ensure\u201d they don\u2019t miss any Knicks, Rangers, Islanders or Devils action.\n\nThat option is a 30% discount if they subscribe to the streaming service Fubo, which carries MSG Networks, as long as they keep Optimum\u2019s internet service.\n\nThe blackout immediately impacted Devils and Knicks games scheduled on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nOptimum also issued a scathing message Wednesday aimed at MSGN, which is led by Knicks and Rangers owner James Dolan.\n\n\u201cMSG Networks demanded that we pay an exorbitant amount in fees to be able to carry its content and that customers who don\u2019t want the content \u2013 who are the majority \u2013 have to pay for it anyway,\u201d Optimum said.\n\n5 Optimum subscribers were greeted with message Wednesday informing them that MSG Networks is no longer available.\n\n\u201cDespite this, Optimum offered to absorb their egregious price demands if we could package MSG Networks in a way that would give more flexibility and control to our customers. \u2026 MSG Networks said no and refused multiple offers from us to reach a deal.\u201d\n\nMSGN issued a rebuttal in its own New Year\u2019s Day statement: \u201cThis is a pure and simple price gauge from Altice. An attempt to add over $10 dollars a month right to their bottom line. In essence a $10 dollar rate increase on top of a 50 % rate increase.\u201d\n\nThe company also said that it had \u201coffered Altice a number of fair and reasonable proposals that called for Altice to pay us less than last year. Altice rejected all of them, including our offer to keep MSG Networks on the air while we continued to try to reach a deal. We remain ready to negotiate in good faith.\u201d\n\nIn an odd bit of irony, the Knicks owner is feuding with the company founded in 1973 by his dad, cable pioneer Charles Dolan, and then called Cablevision. It was sold, along with the Optimum brand, to European telecom giant Altice for $17.7 billion in 2016. Charles Dolan died last weekend at age 98.\n\nOptimum subscribers, meanwhile, were furious over losing access to their beloved teams.\n\n5 New York Rangers fans will not be able to see their team play on Optimum. Neil Miller\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t care whose fault it is now that MSG has gone dark on Optimum,\u201d Lou Panico of Manalapan, NJ fumed. \u201cAs usual the consumer is caught in the middle between two greedy, dishonest entities.\u201d\n\nMSGN was willing to move from the basic Optimum tier where it was getting a roughly $10-per-subscriber fee in 2024, according to a source close to the negotiations.\n\nThat\u2019s about the same rate that national sports giant ESPN charges cable companies.\n\nThe move from basic cable to a premiere tier could hit debt-saddled MSGN\u2019s bottom line by as much as 50%, since the majority of Optimum\u2019s roughly 1 million subscribers in the New York City area would no longer pay for the channel, an RSN executive working for another network told The Post.\n\nOptimum does face the risk also of losing subscribers to rival cable companies like Charter Communications and Verizon\u2019s Fios, which has a deal to carry MSG on basic cable.\n\nDolan recently negotiated a new deal with a major New York-area cable company in which it was moved off the basic tier and accepted lower overall revenue in return for a longer pact, two sources familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nHowever, Optimum is the only cable option in large swathes of the city, and once the hard-core sports fans jump ship it may be in no hurry to return to the negotiating table, a source said.\n\n5 James Dolan\u2019s MSG Networks could be forced into bankruptcy if the channel is dropped by Optimum, a source said. Brad Penner-Imagn Images\n\nAltice could decide to play hardball and threaten to drop the channel to extract better terms from MSGN.\n\n\u201cWhen you drop an RSN, you lose about 5% of your customers but your revenue increases nearly 20% since you save money by not paying for that channel,\u201d the RSN executive said.\n\nThe impasse could exacerbate the overall trend of cord-cutting that has eaten away at cable\u2019s dominance over the past decade.\n\nIn 2023, MSGN Networks launched a streaming service priced at $29.99 a month. Last year, it teamed with the YES Network, home of the Yankees and Nets, on the Gotham Sports app, which costs $41.99 a month if one combines YES and MSG. Customers can still just get MSG for $29.99.\n\nMSGN has been in a protracted standoff with Comcast for more than two years, impacting subscribers in New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nBut an extended fight with Optimum could force MSGN into bankruptcy, sources said.\n\nThe network, which is part of publicly-traded Sphere Entertainment, has been in default on $830 million in loans since October and has a forbearance agreement with its lenders that expires Jan. 10.\n\n5 New York Rangers fans in some Optimum regions may switch to Verizon\u2019s Fios. Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post\n\nThe debt on that loan is trading at five cents on the dollar, the RSN executive said.\n\n\u201cA full drop would ultimately bankrupt MSG Networks,\u201d media analyst LightShed Partners said in a report this week.\n\nMSGN is losing money party because it is paying $187 million in 2025 to broadcast Knicks and Rangers games as part of a 20-year agreement that ends in 2035, according to public filings.\n\nBut the revenue MSGN gets from cable providers, in deals that have much shorter time frames, is falling.\n\nIf MSGN was pushed into bankruptcy, it could renegotiate with the Knicks and Rangers and likely pay much lower rights fees to reflect the new RSN market, the RSN executive said.\n\nAn MSGN bankruptcy would not necessarily be bad for Dolan, who controls both Sphere Entertainment and Madison Square Garden Sports, the parent company of the Knicks, Rangers and operator of the World\u2019s Most Famous Arena.\n\nHe would take a hit from reduced rights fees for the Knicks and Rangers.\n\nBut cleaving away MSGN would likely boost Sphere Entertainment, which also includes the $2.3 billion futuristic Las Vegas music mecca.\n\n\u201cThis would be good news for Sphere shareholders,\u201d LightShed said. \u201cRemoving the $830 million in MSG Networks debt from Sphere\u2019s balance sheet should mean a significant increase in Sphere\u2019s stock price.\n\nMSG Networks declined comment about its financial status.",

(NYSE:VZ) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nMacroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation.\n\nImproved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024.\n\nDividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019\u2014a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates\u2014dividends contributed 75% to the market\u2019s overall returns.\n\nInvestors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company\u2019s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not.\n\nReflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers.",

The sparse, two-page indictment (PDF) doesn\u2019t reference specific victims or hacking activity, nor does it include any personal details about the accused. But a conversation with Wagenius\u2019 mother \u2014 Minnesota native Alicia Roen \u2014 filled in the gaps. Roen said that prior to her son\u2019s arrest he\u2019d acknowledged being associated with Connor Riley Moucka, a.k.a. \u201cJudische,\u201d a prolific cybercriminal from Canada who was arrested in late October for stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that stored data at the cloud service Snowflake.\n\nThe site\u2019s Brian Krebs had previously identified evidence from chat logs that Kiberphant0m was a US soldier stationed in South Korea.\n\nMoucka was arrested back in November, and has been indicted of 20 counts. The report suggests that Moucka was the primary hacker, while the main role of Wagenius was to obtain money from the data.\n\nMassive AT&T data breach\n\nOne of the ransom demands appears to relate to a massive data breach at AT&T, in which personal details were obtained for almost every customer the carrier had at the time.\n\nIn an incredible security fail, the stolen data includes not only customer phone numbers, but also records of who contacted whom \u2013 a potential privacy minefield [\u2026] To make matters worse, hackers were also able to obtain cell site identification numbers for some of the calls and texts \u2013 which can provide locations of customers to an accuracy of around 300 feet in some areas.\n\nIt was later reported that AT&T paid a ransom of $373k in Bitcoin in return for the deletion of the data.\n\nThe carrier said the data was obtained from a third-party cloud platform, and this is now believed to be Snowflake \u2013 where data from other companies was also obtained. This includes obtaining the personal data of 560M TicketMaster customers. Wired provides evidence that AT&T paid a ransom to the hacker in return for them deleting the data. The hacker originally demanded $1M in Bitcoin, and the amount finally paid was the equivalent of $373k.\n\nVerizon call logs\n\nThe other demand appears to relate to Verizon call logs.\n\nOn Nov. 5, Kiberphant0m offered call logs stolen from Verizon\u2019s push-to-talk (PTT) customers \u2014 mainly U.S. government agencies and emergency first responders. On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a \u201cSIM-swapping\u201d service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target\u2019s phone calls and text messages to a device they control.\n\nThe indictment against Wagenius has been transferred to the Western District of Washington in Seattle.\n\nPhoto by Levi Meir Clancy on Unsplash",

It\u2019s widely available in the city and offers speeds up to 2,000Mbps. That said, Cox has several drawbacks, like slow upload speeds, price increases after two years and data caps. Still, it\u2019s the best choice among a number of flawed providers.\n\nIf you can get it, AT&T Fiber offers the fastest internet speeds in Oceanside. Unfortunately, it\u2019s currently available to only about 22% of homes in the city. Another alternative to Cox is wireless internet, which both T-Mobile and Verizon offer.

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines -- and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.\n\nFor more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.\n\n0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics -- browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.\n\n5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.\n\n40 to 100Mbps should give one person sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming.\n\n100 to 500Mbps allows one to two people to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming.\n\n500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more people to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time.\n\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers in Oceanside\n\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it\u2019s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what\u2019s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP\u2019s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\n\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n\nDoes the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they\u2019re paying? Are customers happy with their service?\n\nWhile the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\n\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\nInternet providers in Oceanside FAQs\n\nWhat is the best internet service provider in Oceanside? Cox is the best internet service provider in Oceanside, offering the broadest coverage and cheapest plans in the area. Cox\u2019s drawbacks include slow upload speeds and steep price increases after two years.\n\nIs fiber internet available in Oceanside? Yes, fiber internet is available to 22% of Oceanside households, according to FCC data. AT&T Fiber is the only fiber provider in the city.\n\nWhat is the cheapest internet provider in Oceanside? Cox is the cheapest internet provider in Oceanside. Its ConnectAssist plan provides speeds up to 100Mbps for $30 per month. AT&T Fiber, T-Mobile Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet are other affordbable internet providers in Oceanside, offering plans that start around $50 a month and are a decent value.",

News first broke in October that the hackers had compromised the networks of some of the largest U.S. phone and internet companies to gather intelligence on U.S. citizens.\n\nU.S. officials said earlier this month that at least eight telecommunications providers had been targeted, including Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and T-Mobile. On Friday, Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said a ninth victim had been identified, according to Reuters.\n\nNeuberger, who didn\u2019t name the newly identified victim, said one of the nine telecoms breached involved an administrator account that had access to over 100,000 routers.\n\nUpdated with post-publish comment from AT&T.",

            "content": "Federal authorities have arrested and indicted a 20-year-old U.S. Army soldier on suspicion of being Kiberphant0m, a cybercriminal who has been selling and leaking sensitive customer call records stolen earlier this year from AT&T and Verizon. As first reported by KrebsOnSecurity last month, the accused is a communications specialist who was recently stationed in South Korea.\n\nCameron John Wagenius was arrested near the Army base in Fort Hood, Texas on Dec. 20, after being indicted on two criminal counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records.\n\nThe sparse, two-page indictment (PDF) doesn\u2019t reference specific victims or hacking activity, nor does it include any personal details about the accused. But a conversation with Wagenius\u2019 mother \u2014 Minnesota native Alicia Roen \u2014 filled in the gaps.\n\nRoen said that prior to her son\u2019s arrest he\u2019d acknowledged being associated with Connor Riley Moucka, a.k.a. \u201cJudische,\u201d a prolific cybercriminal from Canada who was arrested in late October for stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that stored data at the cloud service Snowflake.\n\nIn an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Judische said he had no interest in selling the data he\u2019d stolen from Snowflake customers and telecom providers, and that he preferred to outsource that to Kiberphant0m and others. Meanwhile, Kiberphant0m claimed in posts on Telegram that he was responsible for hacking into at least 15 telecommunications firms, including AT&T and Verizon.\n\nOn November 26, KrebsOnSecurity published a story that followed a trail of clues left behind by Kiberphantom indicating he was a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea.\n\nMs. Roen said Cameron worked on radio signals and network communications at an Army base in South Korea for the past two years, returning to the United States periodically. She said Cameron was always good with computers, but that she had no idea he might have been involved in criminal hacking.\n\n\u201cI never was aware he was into hacking,\u201d Roen said. \u201cIt was definitely a shock to me when we found this stuff out.\u201d\n\nMs. Roen said Cameron joined the Army as soon as he was of age, following in his older brother\u2019s footsteps.\n\n\u201cHe and his brother when they were like 6 and 7 years old would ask for MREs from other countries,\u201d she recalled, referring to military-issued \u201cmeals ready to eat\u201d food rations. \u201cThey both always wanted to be in the Army. I\u2019m not sure where things went wrong.\u201d\n\nImmediately after news broke of Moucka\u2019s arrest, Kiberphant0m posted on the hacker community BreachForums what they claimed were the AT&T call logs for President-elect Donald J. Trump and for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\u201cIn the event you do not reach out to us @ATNT all presidential government call logs will be leaked,\u201d Kiberphant0m threatened, signing their post with multiple \u201c#FREEWAIFU\u201d tags. \u201cYou don\u2019t think we don\u2019t have plans in the event of an arrest? Think again.\u201d\n\nOn that same day, Kiberphant0m posted what they claimed was the \u201cdata schema\u201d from the U.S. National Security Agency.\n\nOn Nov. 5, Kiberphant0m offered call logs stolen from Verizon\u2019s push-to-talk (PTT) customers \u2014 mainly U.S. government agencies and emergency first responders. On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a \u201cSIM-swapping\u201d service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target\u2019s phone calls and text messages to a device they control.\n\nThe profile photo on Wagenius\u2019 Facebook page was deleted within hours of my Nov. 26 story identifying Kiberphant0m as a likely U.S. Army soldier. Still, many of his original profile photos remain, including several that show Wagenius in uniform while holding various Army-issued weapons.\n\nNovember\u2019s story on Kiberphant0m cited his own Telegram messages saying he maintained a large botnet that was used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to knock websites, users and networks offline. In 2023, Kiberphant0m sold remote access credentials for a major U.S. defense contractor.\n\nAllison Nixon, chief research officer at the New York-based cybersecurity firm Unit 221B, helped track down Kiberphant0m\u2019s real life identity. Nixon was among several security researchers who faced harassment and specific threats of violence from Judische and his associates.\n\n\u201cAnonymously extorting the President and VP as a member of the military is a bad idea, but it\u2019s an even worse idea to harass people who specialize in de-anonymizing cybercriminals,\u201d Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. She said the investigation into Kiberphant0m shows that law enforcement is getting better and faster at going after cybercriminals \u2014 especially those who are actually living in the United States.\n\n\u201cBetween when we, and an anonymous colleague, found his opsec mistake on November 10th to his last Telegram activity on December 6, law enforcement set the speed record for the fastest turnaround time for an American federal cyber case that I have witnessed in my career,\u201d she said.\n\nNixon asked to share a message for all the other Kiberphant0ms out there who think they can\u2019t be found and arrested.\n\n\u201cI know that young people involved in cybercrime will read these articles,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cYou need to stop doing stupid shit and get a lawyer. Law enforcement wants to put all of you in prison for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe indictment against Wagenius was filed in Texas, but the case has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle.",

            "content": "Three months after reports surfaced about a cyberattack, called Salt Typhoon, targeting internet service providers and US wiretapping infrastructure, two of the largest telecom companies say they've made progress securing their networks against the threat.\n\nAT&T and Verizon each released statements over the weekend addressing Salt Typhoon for the first time since working with federal law enforcement and other entities. AT&T said in its statement that, based on its investigation, China was targeting a \"small number of individuals of foreign intelligence interest\" and that the company is working to protect customer data.\n\nVerizon, meanwhile, said it has \"contained the cyber incident brought on by this nation-state threat actor\" and that it has \"not detected threat actor activity\" in its network for some time. It added that a third-party security firm has confirmed the containment.\n\nIn late September and early October, reports first described the Salt Typhoon attacks, which led the FBI to warn that some types of messaging, such as RCS texting between iOS and Android phones, may be at risk.\n\nIt now appears that Salt Typhoon has been a more targeted attack than was earlier believed, even though hundreds of millions of customers could have had their data and personal information at risk.\n\n\"In this incident, a small number of high-profile customers in government and politics were specifically targeted by the threat actor,\" Verizon said in its statement. \"Those customers have been notified of the activity.\"\n\nBoth Verizon and AT&T noted that they partnered with government and law enforcement agencies, telecommunications industry partners and private cybersecurity firms.\n\n\"In the relatively few instances in which an individual's information was impacted, we have complied with our notification obligations,\" AT&T said.\n\nOver the weekend, a ninth company affected by the hacking was said to be identified, but the White House didn't release the name of the company.\n\nT-Mobile reiterated Monday that it wasn't one of the nine referenced by the government, and it pointed to a T-Mobile blog post from late November, which offers details.",

New York City-based Verizon said in a separate statement that \u201ca small number of high-profile customers in government and politics\u201d had been targeted.\n\n\u201cWe have not detected threat actor activity in Verizon\u2019s network for some time, and after considerable work addressing this incident, we can report that Verizon has contained the activities associated with this particular incident,\u201d Verizon Chief Legal Officer Vandana Venkatesh said the statement.\n\nAn independent cybersecurity firm confirmed the containment of the threat, Verizon said.\n\nBoth carriers said they are cooperating with authorities and notifying parties whose information may have been compromised.\n\n\u201cWe detect no activity by nation-state actors in our networks at this time,\u201d AT&T said. \u201cBased on our current investigation of this attack, the People\u2019s Republic of China targeted a small number of individuals of foreign intelligence interest. In the relatively few instances in which an individual\u2019s information was impacted, we have complied with our notification obligations in cooperation with law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in October that telecom carriers including AT&T and Verizon were hit by the Salt Typhoon network intrusions, and the hackers potentially accessed systems the federal government uses for court-authorized network wiretapping requests.\n\nSince then, information about what\u2019s going on inside the carriers hasn\u2019t been shared widely. T-Mobile USA Inc. disclosed that it caught suspicious behavior on network-level routers that appeared consistent with Salt Typhoon, but it booted the attackers before they accessed any customer data.\n\nThe White House confirmed Friday that nine telecom companies were breached in the intrusion, nicknamed Salt Typhoon by Microsoft Corp. threat researchers, but US officials didn\u2019t name the affected companies.\n\nUS officials have said they still don\u2019t know exactly how many Americans were targeted and that it\u2019s impossible to predict how long it will take to eradicate the threat across the country.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied involvement. The Biden administration recently called telecom industry leaders to a closed-door session in which industry and government representatives discussed how to address the vast vulnerabilities. The attendees included AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey.\n\nPhoto: Photographer: Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg\n\nCopyright 2025 Bloomberg.\n\nTopics Catastrophe Natural Disasters Cyber",

However, the company's Chief Security Officer, Jeff Simon, didn't link the hack to Salt Typhoon and added that the carrier's cyber defenses stopped the attack originating from a connected wireline provider's network.\n\n\"Bad actors had no access to sensitive customer data (including calls, voicemails, or texts). We quickly severed connectivity to the provider's network as we believe it was \u2013 and may still be \u2013 compromised,\" Simon said.\n\nThe White House's deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, Anne Neuberger, told reporters on Friday that the Chinese hacking campaign impacted nine U.S. telecommunications companies. Earlier this month, Neuberger also revealed in a press briefing that the Chinese hackers had breached carriers in dozens of other countries.\n\nThe U.S. government reportedly plans to ban China Telecom's last active U.S. operations in response to the telecom hacks and is also considering banning TP-Link routers if ongoing investigations find that their use in cyberattacks is a national security risk.\n\nIn addition, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said the agency would act \"urgently\" to ensure that U.S. carriers are required to secure their infrastructure. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon also announced a new bill to secure the networks of American telecoms.\n\nThe Salt Typhoon Chinese cyber-espionage group (also tracked as Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, Ghost Emperor, and UNC2286) behind this hacking campaign has been active since at least 2019 and is known for breaching telecom companies and government entities throughout Southeast Asia.",
