            "content": "Some US embassies in European nations are taking to social media with pointed warnings to would-be visitors about their conduct in the country following a clampdown on visa-holders by the Trump administration.\n\nEmbassies in at least 17 countries have put up posts featuring images of administration figures, including President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, warning those seeking visas that engaging in behavior deemed harmful by the government could get deported.\n\nIn a post put up by the US Embassy in Tallinn, Estonia, the message reads: \"When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest. Now, if you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organisations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. You lied to us. You're out.\"\n\nAnother post put up by the US Embassy in Budapest has a quote from Rubio, saying, \"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety.\"\n\nThe posts come at time when the Trump administration is clamping down on those with visas, like international students or professors, who have taken part in protests on university campuses around the conflict in Gaza in support of Palestinians and against Israel's military actions.\n\nThat's included taking visas away and putting the visa holders in immigration detention, and blocking people from entering the country. Among the cases is that of Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student at Columbia University.\n\nAt a regular briefing Monday, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce called the warnings \"reasonable.\"\n\n\"Follow the law, behave yourselves, be a good visitor and you'll be fine,\" Bruce said. \"It's a visa. It's not an entitlement. A visa and a green card are not birthrights. These are privileges you're granted ... because of what you present to the United States.\"\n\nShe added, \"Every sovereign nation in the world has an interest in controlling who comes in, knowing who's coming into their country, what their intentions are.\"\n\nWhile it's standard practice for those who apply for visas to enter the United States to come under scrutiny when they apply, the language being used in the posts and the social media campaign nature of the posts showcases the stance the administration has taken in regard to who's allowed to be in the country and what behavior the US government deems acceptable.\n\nSome of the posts reflect the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, such as the one posted by the US Embassy in Denmark. It features a Noem quote saying, \"If you're considering traveling to the United States illegally, don't even think about it.\"",

She obtained her medical degree from the American University of Beirut in 2015 and completed her residency in 2018 at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.\n\nSince she entered the United States on a J-1 visa in 2018, Alawieh went on to complete programs at Ohio State University, the University of Washington and the Yale Waterbury Internal Medicine Program before she started her assistant professorship at Brown.\n\n\u201cThe Division of Nephrology at Brown Medicine is extremely distressed at this treatment of their colleague,\u201d the court petition said. \u201cShe is an assistant professor and has serious responsibilities. Her colleagues have been covering for her, but that is no solution.\u201d\n\nBrown University spokesperson Brian Clark said in a statement that the university is \u201cseeking to learn more about what has happened, but we need to be careful about sharing information publicly about any individual\u2019s personal circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe next hearing is scheduled for Monday morning.",

Furthermore, it lays a foundation for Fundiin to explore further collaboration opportunities in the future.\n\nAlthough Vietnam\u2019s digital finance market has seen rapid growth over the last few years, many consumers still struggle to access secure and high-quality financial services due to ineffective risk assessment systems.\n\nThis partnership with Visa marks a pivotal step in strengthening Fundiin\u2019s risk management framework by integrating advanced technology and adhering to global best practices.\n\nBy leveraging Visa\u2019s expertise in developing best-in-class solutions for credit scoring and combining it with Fundiin\u2019s specialised data-management technologies tailored to Vietnam, Fundiin believes the accuracy, comprehensiveness, and reliability of its credit scores will be significantly improved.\n\nAs a result, Fundiin will be able to improve processing time, increase approval rates, and lower bad debt ratios.\n\nFor consumers, this partnership unlocks significant benefits, particularly for individuals with limited or no credit history who often face challenges accessing traditional financial institutions.\n\nWith enhanced risk assessment models, Fundiin can help build credit profiles for these individuals, paving the way for larger financial transactions- such as home purchases-at lower costs in the future.\n\n\u201cPartnering with Visa is a strategic milestone that underscores our long-term commitment to innovation and technological advancement.

            "content": "A new study commissioned by Visa reveals a rise in consumer awareness and proactive security measures for digital payments in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The ninth annual Stay Secure study , which surveyed 5,800 adults across 17 CEMEA markets, found that 97% of consumers in KSA now actively take precautions to secure their online transactions, showcasing increased savviness as digital payments gain momentum.\n\nWhile 43% of respondents in Saudi Arabia acknowledge their vulnerability to scams, the increased adoption of security measures and preference for stronger authentication indicate a positive shift in consumer behavior since the last edition of the Stay Secure study in 2023. Consumers are now actively spotting red flags and verifying the legitimacy of online interactions, showing a marked increase in awareness.\n\nOther key insights emerging from the research bode well for the continued acceleration of digital payments in KSA, with almost three-quarters (73%) of all respondents stating that they mostly or completely trust digital payments. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of respondents anticipate that they will increase their use of digital payments over the next year.\n\nThe digital payments landscape is evolving rapidly, and consumers across Saudi Arabia are embracing its convenience while becoming more vigilant about security. Consumer education is our best defense against fraud, and industry collaboration makes this possible. As scams grow more sophisticated, the battle for security never stops. Consumers increasingly trust partners who take tangible steps to protect them. \u2013 Neil Fernandes, Head of Risk for Middle East and North Africa, Visa\n\nWe are delighted to launch Visa\u2019s latest Stay Secure research for KSA which underscores the important role retailers and financial institutions play in building and maintaining consumer trust in digital payments. Our latest research provides valuable insights that can inform industry strategies to enhance consumer trust and protect the payments system and support the Saudi government\u2019s Vision 2030 cashless agenda. \u2013 Ali Bailoun, Regional General Manager Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman, Visa\n\nThe Stay Secure study highlights evolving consumer preferences, which could offer Visa\u2019s stakeholders actionable intelligence for trust-building strategies and inform the creation of educational materials to empower consumers against fraud.\n\nKey Findings of the Visa Stay Secure Study in Saudi Arabia:\n\nFalling for Scams. With growing reliance on digital payments, scams continue to proliferate. Almost half (43%) of consumers in Saudi Arabia have fallen for a scam, with 10% being victims on multiple occasions. For example, 59% have been approached by someone requesting them to transfer money on their behalf. Despite this, only 31% admit to being primarily responsible for falling victim to a scam, while half place blame on others.\n\nVulnerable Loved Ones. While 62% of surveyed consumers in Saudi Arabia have some degree of confidence in their own ability to spot fraud, 96% worry their family or friends might fall for a scam. Eighty-eight percent (88%) believe that Gen X\u00b9 digital payment users are most likely to get scammed online.\n\nDetecting Fraudsters. Consumers are highly wary of suspicious text messages or emails, recognizing these as potential scams designed to steal their money. The biggest red flag for fraud is a request to reset passwords or account information due to a data breach, with 71% of respondents ranking it as one of the top three most suspicious messages.\n\nTaking Precautions. Nearly all (97%) surveyed consumers in Saudi Arabia take measures to secure their payments. Sixty percent (60%) decline to respond to emails asking them to transfer money on someone else\u2019s behalf, while 58% refrain from sharing card or account credentials. Forty-four percent (44%) also regularly monitor their bank statements for suspicious activity.\n\nRising Digital Payments. Consumers in Saudi Arabia use a variety of digital payment methods, the most common being mobile payments (66%), card payments (63%), and bank transfers via mobile banking apps or platforms (56%). Sixty-nine percent (69%) of the respondents find digital payments quicker and simpler than other methods and 59% appreciate that they allow payments anytime, anywhere.\n\nComfort in Digital Payments. Mobile payments are also seen as one of the most secure digital payment methods. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments are used by 39% of adults in Saudi Arabia, yet only 2% consider them the easiest payment option. This highlights an opportunity to improve the user experience and simplify the process for greater adoption.\n\nBuilding Trust. As digital payments gain traction, retailers, banks, and payment processors can build trust by requiring users to confirm purchases via texted codes or links and displaying trusted security badges. Nearly nine in 10 (88%) consumers in Saudi Arabia feel safer when they must confirm their identity through a text code, while half (50%) value visible security icons.\n\nVisa\u2019s Commitment to a Secure Digital Future\n\nVisa has been at the center of AI in payments, investing $3.3 billion in our AI and data infrastructure over the last decade. In 2024, it introduced three new AI-powered risk and fraud prevention solutions, as part of the Visa Protect suite, that are designed to help reduce fraud across immediate A2A and card-not-present (CNP) payments, as well as transactions on and off Visa\u2019s network.\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest SaaS platform, Visa combats cybercrime by deploying cutting-edge tools, expertise, and processes to help identify and mitigate fraud. The impact is undeniable: In the past year, Visa blocked $40 billion in fraudulent payment value, prevented 80 million fraudulent transactions, and averted over $122 million in estimated e-commerce fraud through malware detection.",

So, outsiders will certainly not come to the US to pay global tax. So, if you have a Green Card, now a Gold Card, you will be a permanent resident of America (without paying tax).

He added that the funds generated by this program will be used to reduce the United States\u2019 fiscal deficit or national debt.",

Now, if you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. You lied to us. You\u2019re out.\u201d\n\nAnother post put up by the U.S. Embassy in Budapest has a quote from Rubio, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety.\u201d\n\nThe posts come at time when the Trump administration is clamping down on those with visas, like international students or professors, who have taken part in protests on university campuses around the conflict in Gaza in support of Palestinians and against Israel\u2019s military actions.\n\nThat\u2019s included taking visas away and putting the visa holders in immigration detention, and blocking people from entering the country. Among the cases is that of Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student at Columbia University.\n\nAt a regular briefing Monday, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce called the warnings \u201creasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollow the law, behave yourselves, be a good visitor and you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIt\u2019s a visa. It\u2019s not an entitlement. A visa and a green card are not birthrights. These are privileges you\u2019re granted ... because of what you present to the United States.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cEvery sovereign nation in the world has an interest in controlling who comes in, knowing who\u2019s coming into their country, what their intentions are.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s standard practice for those who apply for visas to enter the United States to come under scrutiny when they apply, the language being used in the posts and the social media campaign nature of the posts showcases the stance the administration has taken in regard to who\u2019s allowed to be in the country and what behavior the U.S. government deems acceptable.\n\nSome of the posts reflect the administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration, such as the one posted by the U.S. Embassy in Denmark. It features a Noem quote saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re considering traveling to the United States illegally, don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed.",

            "content": "ITHACA, N.Y. \u2014 The U.S. Department of State revoked the student visa of Cornell graduate student and pro-Palestine activist Momodou Taal, court documents filed Saturday show.\n\nTaal is one of three plaintiffs in a March 15 federal lawsuit claiming that the Trump administration is unfairly targeting pro-Palestinian activists with two recent executive orders.\n\nThe move comes days after Taal, a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia, was asked to surrender himself to immigration officials in an email sent in the early morning hours on March 21.\n\nThe notice that Taal\u2019s visa had been revoked was sent nearly 20 hours after he received the initial \u201cinvitation\u201d to surrender himself to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nTaal\u2019s lead attorney, Eric Lee, confirmed that his client\u2019s visa had been revoked but that he had not yet turned himself into ICE custody.\n\nImmigration attorneys interviewed by The Ithaca Voice called the flurry of recent immigration actions against Taal \u201chighly irregular,\u201d given their rapid pace and timeline.\n\nTaal\u2019s attorneys allege the recent attempts at immigration enforcement against their client are retaliation for filing the lawsuit, which seeks a national injunction against enforcing the two executive orders.\n\nFederal attorneys contested that allegation, claiming in documents filed Saturday that Taal\u2019s visa revocation predated the March 15 lawsuit by one day.\n\nThe filing includes a declaration from Trump-appointed State Department Senior Bureau Official John Armstrong. Unlike an affidavit, a declaration does not need to be given under oath or notarized.\n\nIn the declaration, Armstrong said the State Department had revoked Taal\u2019s visa on March 14 \u2014 the day before the lawsuit was filed \u2014 and informed him of the decision via email the evening of March 21.\n\nIn the declaration, Armstrong said Taal\u2019s visa was revoked because he participated in \u201cdisruptive protests that created a hostile environment for Jewish students,\u201d not because of his lawsuit.\n\nArmstrong cited Cornell\u2019s decision to temporarily suspend Taal for his participation in a September 2024 demonstration that disrupted an on-campus career fair featuring arms manufacturers, as well as other protests. The university later reversed the suspension.\n\nConnecticut-based immigration attorney Glenn Formica said the speed and manner in which the federal government was pursuing deportation proceedings against Taal prompts questions about due process.\n\nFormica is not involved in Taal\u2019s immigration case or the federal lawsuit but agreed to review and discuss his case with The Ithaca Voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s puzzling to me as an immigration lawyer as to how [Taal\u2019s] student visa would have been revoked since Jan 20,\u201d Formica said. \u201cHow, in the past 63 days [since Trump\u2019s inauguration] Taal could have been served with a notice to revoke his student visa and then be put into immigration court to be put into deportation proceedings. It\u2019s just puzzling to me how they could give him due process [on that timeline.]\u201d\n\nThe first hearing for Taal\u2019s federal lawsuit is scheduled for March 25 at 2 p.m. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York in Syracuse, with crowds of supporters expected to attend.\n\n\n\nTaal is not the first international student activist to face immigration challenges after engaging in activism criticizing Israel\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nA former graduate student at Columbia University, Mahmoud Khalil, was arrested in a high-profile operation outside his apartment in New York City. Khalil, a Palestinian citizen, is currently being held in an immigration detention center in Louisiana as he awaits potential deportation.",

He had obtained an ESTA and had a been visiting his American fianc\u00e9e, Lennon Tyler, who lives in Las Vegas. She told reporters that they had traveled to Tijuana to obtain veterinary treatment for her dog. When they attempted to reenter the U.S., Tyler alleges that CBP officers became \u201cvery aggressive and hostile almost immediately.\u201d Sielaff has told reporters that owing to the language barrier, he incorrectly answered a question about where he lived and officers accused him of living in Las Vegas rather than visiting. His ESTA was ultimately canceled, and he was handcuffed and arrested. \u201cThere was no proof that I overstayed anything,\u201d he later told ABC-10 News.\n\nTyler told the New York Times that at the border crossing, after she tried to get answers about what was happening to her fianc\u00e9e, she was subjected to a body search by ICE officers and was briefly chained to a bench.\n\nSielaff said he was held by CBP at the border for two days before being transferred by ICE to the for-profit Otay Mesa Detention Center, where he shared a cell with eight other people. He was held for a total of 16 days before returning to Germany on March 6. Per the Times, Tyler says he was only able to get out because \u201cwe made ourselves a nuisance\u201d:\n\nDr. Tyler called the immigration authorities daily, she hired lawyers who also called them, she gave news media interviews and she reached out repeatedly to a German Consulate. [Eventually] Mr. Sielaff was allowed voluntary deportation, on a flight that cost him $2,744.\n\n.\n\nA 35-year-old Canadian entrepreneur attempted to enter to renew her work permit at the Mexican border and ended up detained for 12 days at two grim ICE facilities.\n\nThe details of her case are unusual. Jasmine Mooney, who once starred in a direct-to-video American Pie spinoff and more recently co-founded the American-based Holy Water! brand, said that while she was living in Vancouver, she discovered that her U.S. work permit had expired after three years. She decided to travel to Mexico to attempt to obtain a new permit at a San Ysidro border crossing, at which point her troubles began. The New York Times has a rundown of the complex logistics involved:\n\nMs. Mooney was applying for a TN visa, which allows professionals from Canada and Mexico to stay temporarily in the United States. She initially applied for one last year for her other marketing job, but she said that it had been rejected because the company\u2019s letterhead was missing from her documents.\n\nShe said she had successfully reapplied about a month later at the San Ysidro border crossing, but when she tried to return to the United States at the end of November, a U.S. immigration official at the airport in Vancouver revoked her visa. He explained that her application had not been processed properly, she said, and raised concerns over one company that was employing her that sold hemp-based products.\n\nMs. Mooney said it was not uncommon for people like her who work in Southern California to apply for visas at the San Ysidro border station, so earlier this month, she figured she would try again.\n\nMooney says that rather than simply denying her entry, ICE agents detained her for unclear reasons, then moved her to an ICE prison in Southern California before transferring her to one in Arizona a few days later. She described bleak conditions at both facilities, describing her conditions to People as \u201cinhumane\u201d and feeling like a \u201cdeeply disturbing psychological experiment.\u201d She describes being shackled for up to 24 hours in a row, sleeping on a mat with no blanket, having \u201caluminum foil wrapped over my body like a dead body for two and a half days,\u201d among other indignities.\n\nMooney says she was freed without explanation, and is still unsure why she was detained in the first place. She described her ordeal more thoroughly in a first-person article published in The Guardian on Wednesday.",

However, many experts and immigration attorneys feel that there\u2019s no need to panic for most Indians who are on green cards and may need to travel outside the US, including on visits to India.\u201cThough green cards can be revoked for certain reasons, including national security risks or criminal activity, most Indian professionals are law-abiding and tax-paying individuals. They don\u2019t need to panic. As long as they follow US laws, avoid criminal activities, maintain strong ties to the US, and avoid extended stays abroad, they have little to worry about,\u201d says Neha Mahajan, co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting Indians stuck in long green card queues. She adds that green cards aren\u2019t automatically at risk unless someone engages in actions that violate immigration rules or national security policies.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)The green card is a status of permanent resident in the US; hence strong ties to the US are important. \u201cOne can have multiple residences but the US government wants America to be the permanent residence of green card holders,\u201d says Manjunath Gokare, an attorney based in Atlanta, Georgia, who specialises in immigration. Law requires that the green card holder must live in the US (maintain a home or apartment); maintain employment in the US; file income taxes in the US on all income earned globally; and maintain US bank accounts and driver\u2019s licence.An important factor for green card status is the duration of travel outside the US and long absences are not recommended. \u201cA stay of less than six months outside the US typically does not raise questions. A stay of more than six months but less than one year could result in additional scrutiny upon arrival in the US. A stay beyond one year without a valid re-entry permit (Form I-131) may lead to the presumption that you have abandoned your green card,\u201d says Mumbai-based immigration lawyer, Poorvi Chothani.For green card holders, it is important to keep certain documents with them and to make sure that they are valid and updated. \u201cKeep your green card valid and on you and renew it on time and always carry the original when you are travelling. Keep your US bank account, active health insurance, driver\u2019s licence, and tax records up to date,\u201d says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should file taxes as resident (1040) and not as non-resident.Given the increased scrutiny at ports of entry, it is wise to carry certain documents for green card holders returning from overseas. \u201cThese include pay stubs from your current employment (last 3 months); employment verification letter and last year\u2019s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy,\u201d says Gokare.It is very important for green card holders not to have been convicted of any criminal offences (classified under US immigration laws as aggravated felonies) that render them deportable or removable, under US immigration laws.\u201cIf one is maintaining their permanent residence in the US and does not have any criminal convictions, then there is nothing to worry about. Green card holders that are targeted by CBP, typically have either residency issues or removable criminal convictions,\u201d says Gokare. He adds that green card holders who believe that they have always complied with the law, but are yet facing issues at the port of entry, should ask the CBP officers to set up a \u2018deferred inspection\u2019.\u201cWith an appointment for deferred inspection, a green card holder is allowed to provide evidence and can be accompanied by a lawyer when they meet with CBP officers to present their case as to how they are maintaining permanent residence in the US,\u201d he says.If faced with tough questions at a US border, green card holders are advised not to sign any forms; including Form I-407; which is the record of abandonment of legal permanent residence status; without consulting their lawyers, even if there is pressure from CBP. \u201cNo one is legally required to sign it. If they refuse, CBP cannot unilaterally strip them of their green card without due process,\u201d says Chothani.Despite providing evidence of resident status and ties to the US, if CBP officials ask green card holders to renounce their green cards on arrival, there are still certain potential recourse measures that can be taken up.\u201cThose who have been outside the US for an extended period should be prepared for questioning by CBP officers. If placed in secondary inspection, it is best to remain calm and provide clear responses regarding ties to the US,\u201d says Chothani.Secondary inspections can take up to two hours to clear and Gokare advises anyone facing such inspections to co-operate with the officers and not get alarmed. Even if CBP insists that a green card holder is inadmissible or has abandoned their green card, they can still request a notice to appear before an immigration judge. This allows them to fight the case in immigration court rather than surrendering the green card at the airport.\u201cIf an individual\u2019s green card is revoked, they may still have a few options including filing for a motion with the USCIS or immigration court to reopen or reconsider and applying for a returning resident visa to regain LPR status,\u201d Chothani says.Finally, five years after getting their green cards, those who are eligible can consider US citizenship. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to make sure you don\u2019t have to worry about losing your status,\u201d says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should stay engaged; follow rules and not let small mistakes put their status at risk.",

            "content": "Acting president Ilie Bolojan said he expects a final response from the United States on the potential delay of Romania's inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program by the end of the week. The statement came amid reports that the Trump administration is reviewing the country's entry and could delay it due to technical reasons.\n\n\"The change in administration has brought a shift in migration policy. President Trump immediately focused on this issue after winning the election. A delay is possible, but Romania has met all the requirements. I believe we will have an answer on this matter by the end of the week,\" Bolojan said in an interview with Observator Antena 1, quoted by Biziday.ro.\n\nPreviously, interior minister C\u0103t\u0103lin Predoiu also emphasized that the discussions about a possible delay are not specific to Romania but are part of the Trump administration's broader review of all migration-related programs.\n\nLast week, the Foreign Ministry said there had been no official communication regarding a possible change in Romania's inclusion in the US Visa Waiver Program.\n\nPrime minister Marcel Ciolacu confirmed a \"temporary delay\" in visa-free travel to the US a few days ago, citing the implementation of \"technical matters\" but without specifying a new timeline.\n\n\"The efforts made by the government I lead regarding Romania's inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program have achieved an irreversible success for Romanian citizens. Romania has met all technical and political requirements. There is no doubt about it. That is why I urge those who shout from the sidelines and have done nothing for this country to refrain from politically speculating on an issue that is merely a temporary delay related to the implementation of technical matters,\" Ciolacu wrote in a post on social media on March 21.\n\nThe official Visa Waiver Program website has yet to confirm any changes, currently showing that Romania's visa-free travel date is still \"to be announced.\"\n\nRomania was formally designated the 43rd country to join the US Visa Waiver Program (VWP) on January 10. The Romanian ambassador to Washington, Andrei Muraru, said at the time that Romanian citizens would be able to travel to the US without the need for a visa starting March 31, 2025.\n\nirina.marica@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Presidency.ro)",

(NYSE:V) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\n\nRay Dalio, with over 50 years of experience, is arguably one of the most influential investors on Wall Street. Having accurately predicted the 2008 financial crisis, he is often looked upon for insights and the direction the market will likely take in times of uncertainty. He is the brains behind Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund he founded in 1973, which leverages various strategies, including Pure Alpha and macroeconomic analysis, to squeeze optimum returns in the markets.\n\nWhile Dalio gave up his CEO role at Bridgewater Associates in 2017, his sentiments still influenced the hedge fund\u2019s investment strategy and play. Likewise, the hedge fund has remained on top of its game, generating an average return of 11.5% annually while leveraging the Pure Alpha Strategy.\n\nREAD ALSO: Paul Singer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks and 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Seth Klarman.\n\nThe outperformance comes as the overall equity market has been in an uptrend amid the artificial intelligence-driven run. Likewise, the US economy staying clear of recession amid high interest has bolstered sentiments about market risk-taking.\n\nEven though the overall equity market has been in an uptrend, billionaire Ray Dalio is sounding the warning bells about an imminent debt crisis. The fact that the US debt-to-GDP ratio has risen to over 122% poses significant risks, according to the founder of Bridgewater Associates.\n\nOver the last two quarters, GDP has been gradually increasing, and unemployment and inflation have been relatively stable. However, Ray Dalio has warned that America\u2019s national debt is a problem that is imminently coming and that it will rock the boat. According to Dalio, the US deficit must drop from a projected 7.2% of gross domestic product to about 3% of GDP.\n\n\u201cWe have a very severe supply and demand problem. Some people think we\u2019ll handle it because we\u2019ve handled it so far. I don\u2019t think they understand the mechanics of debt.\u201d Dalio said\n\nDalio\u2019s caution comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration struggles to retain significant tax cuts while simultaneously cutting the annual deficit, which most recently hit $1.8 trillion.\n\nAccording to Dalio, President Trump has undoubtedly shown that he is not afraid to use economic pressure to further his objectives. An examination of his executive orders since assuming office is sufficient proof that he has what it takes to reduce the US deficit and heightened debt levels.",

The restrictions, introduced at the start of 2024, prevents some students from bringing their families with them to the UK. The government said the new rules were part of measures to curb immigration. The university said it had seen a 51% drop in allocations from international students since the changes were applied. Student Raha Fazlollahei, from Iran, said it was \"really heartbreaking\" to be so far away from her family, but said it was also an opportunity to be independent.\n\nShe said: \"It helps me to grow to be independent and I really like this. I'm 22 right now and at this age I can be on my own.\" It is costing her more than \u00a330,000 per year to study creative writing here, but said it was worth it to build her dream life.\n\nRaha Fazlollahei, from Iran, is studying creative writing at the University of Lincoln\n\nThe university, like most, said it relied on international student fee income to compensate for the freeze on home tuition fees. It said international student applications fell from 2,995 in 2023-24 to 1,460 in 2024-25. Nationally, Home Office figures showed the 393,125 visas that were granted in 2024 represented a 14% drop on the figures from 2023, but that it was still 46% higher than in 2019. \"Removal of the dependents visa has made the UK a less attractive study destination overall in a competitive global marketplace for student recruitment, particularly for international masters students,\" the university said. \"We support sector calls for a more evidence-based approach to international students in national immigration policy, which recognises the need to manage true migration without jeopardising the economic and societal benefits of the UK's standing as a global study destination.\"\n\nGodswill James, from Nigeria, is studying IT and said although the changes \"had impacted\", there were other contributing factors, such as initial course fee deposits and the cost. It is costing him between \u00a325,000 and \u00a330,000. Fellow student Sibghatullah Karimi, from Afghanistan, believed those figures represented a \"big challenge\" to some countries. He said: \"The students from Asian and African countries, their currency difference is too high, so if we convert that currency, it would be in the millions.\" Tsuy Tuong, from Hanoi, Vietnam, said she had dreamt of studying in England since she was 15 and had fallen in love with the British culture. She felt being on her own without family was both a good and bad thing.\n\nLocal economy impact\n\nAs well as bolstering the university's income, international students are also important to the local economy, according to Michael Stacey, who is the general manager of Craft bar, which attracts a lot of students. He said: \"They're a massive economic benefit and a massive social benefit. They improve everything. \"I think immigration is what makes our country fantastic. Multiculturalism brings something different and I think if we bunker down and single into our one-lane we're never going to broaden our horizons, we're never going to learn anything new.\" It is estimated one in seven at the university are international students. The government has been contacted for comment, but has previously said international students \"will always be welcome but the net migration levels seen in recent years have been completely unacceptable, and we have committed to reducing those numbers substantially\".\n\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

While India is not included in the US's proposed travel ban list, returning to the US may prove challenging due to heightened scrutiny at consulates, extended visa processing times, and stricter inspections at airports. Immigration attorneys warn that individuals leaving the US for visa renewals or work-related travel could face unexpected delays or administrative hurdles upon re-entry.Reports suggest that travelers are increasingly worried about the growing backlog and delays in visa stamping at US consulates overseas. Many applicants renewing their visas experience extended processing times, often facing administrative reviews without clear explanations. Legal experts advise visa holders, particularly those renewing H-1B or F-1 visas, to thoroughly assess their travel plans before leaving the US.In addition, extreme vetting measures, including secondary inspections and even detentions at US airports upon return, have become more common.As per reports, the US State Department has recently updated its guidelines for visa interview waivers, commonly referred to as \"dropbox\" applications. Earlier, individuals holding a non-immigrant visa (except visitor visas) that had expired within the last 48 months were eligible for renewal without an interview. However, this timeframe has now been shortened to just 12 months. Consequently, a larger number of applicants will need to attend in-person interviews, making the visa renewal process more time-consuming and complicated.Also read: Donald Trump administration eyes travel bans for 43 countries: Is India on the list? This policy shift has profound implications, particularly for individuals transitioning from an F-1 student visa to an H-1B work visa, as well as those applying for an H-1B extension if their previous visa expired more than a year ago. Previously, many such applicants benefited from interview waivers, allowing for a more streamlined visa renewal process. However, with the updated requirements, these individuals must now schedule an in-person interview at a US consulate, adding an extra layer of complexity and potential delay to their visa approval timeline.The tightening immigration policies mean that even individuals who have had multiple visa approvals in the past may now face administrative processing, delaying their return indefinitely.Also read: UK\u2019s new ETA Rule: Will it affect Indian travellers? It is also reported that consular officers have the authority to refuse a visa and return the case to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for re-adjudication. This could leave H-1B employees and other visa holders stranded outside the US for months, disrupting work and personal lives.Due to these risks, immigration experts highly advise visa applicants and their employers to have contingency plans in place for potential travel delays.",

            "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Visa ( ), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisa's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Visa has grown EPS by 18% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Visa maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 10% to US$37b. That's a real positive.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free ?\n\nAre Visa Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Visa, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$254m. We note that this amounts to 0.04% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Visa but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.\n\nDoes Visa Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Visa's strong EPS growth. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nAlthough Visa certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nA Colorado business owner called her immigration attorney in a panic this week, wrestling with a worry she never expected: If she travels abroad for a conference, could she end up getting deported?\n\nA woman from Cameroon who lives in the Midwest made a heartbreaking decision: Flying home for her father\u2019s funeral would be too risky.\n\nAn immigrant of Palestinian descent cancelled international travel plans \u2014 and worried that walking outside their New England home with a keffiyeh they\u2019ve worn for years might no longer be safe.\n\nAnd a Canadian tattoo artist who lives in Washington state shared her fears on social media about an upcoming trip across the border.\n\nThese four people have never met, and many details of their lives are different. But they share at least one thing in common. They are legal immigrants with green cards \u2014 documents deeming them lawful permanent residents of the United States. And they told CNN they\u2019re still scared the Trump administration could kick them out of the country.\n\nImmigration lawyer LaToya McBean Pompy says this growing fear is the biggest issue she sees among her clients who have green cards.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never been afraid before,\u201d she says, \u201cbut today, they\u2019re afraid.\u201d\n\nWhy some green card holders say they\u2019re worried\n\nAbout 12.8 million green card holders live in the United States, according to the latest estimates from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics.\n\nAnd some of them were taken by surprise when authorities detained a former student protest leader at New York\u2019s Columbia University earlier this month. Mahmoud Khalil, who helped lead the school\u2019s student protest movement demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, is married to a US citizen and had a green card. He isn\u2019t facing any criminal charges, but Trump administration officials have accused him of inciting violence and supporting terrorism \u2013 claims Khalil\u2019s attorneys and supporters deny.\n\n\u201cI think the fact he happened to be a permanent resident underscored the vulnerability of all non-citizens in this country to a lot of people who hadn\u2019t thought it through,\u201d says David Leopold, an immigration attorney in Ohio and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nActivists hold a rally and march through downtown Chicago to show support for Mahmoud Khalil on March 11. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nLeopold says it\u2019s not uncommon for green card holders to be detained and deported if they\u2019re accused and convicted of certain crimes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly routine,\u201d he says, noting that the statute lists offenses such as document fraud, drug offenses and crimes that are deemed \u201caggravated felonies\u201d in immigration law.\n\nWho\u2019s next? Is it a climate activist? It is a gender-rights activist? Is it trans activists? Is it somebody who is concerned about health care? Is it somebody who just simply opposes Donald Trump? David Leopold, immigration attorney\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to deport Khalil under the portion of the statute that cites \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States\u201d is far rarer and more troubling, Leopold says.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d Leopold told reporters on a recent call with immigrant rights advocates. \u201cIs it a climate activist? It is a gender-rights activist? Is it trans activists? Is it somebody who is concerned about health care? Is it somebody who just simply opposes Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nEven before Khalil\u2019s high-profile arrest, many green card holders were wrestling with fears they weren\u2019t expecting, McBean Pompy says.\n\n\u201cI think it had to do with ICE and enforcement activities that folks were seeing and posting about that were happening in their communities,\u201d she says.\n\nRecent comments from officials like Vice President JD Vance have sparked even more concern, she says.\n\n\u201cA green card holder, even if I may like that green card holder, doesn\u2019t have an indefinite right to be in the United States of America, right?\u201d Vance said in an interview with Fox News last week. \u201cAmerican citizens have different rights from people who have green cards, from people who have student visas. And so my attitude on this is, this is not fundamentally about free speech. And to me, yes, it\u2019s about national security, but it\u2019s also, more importantly, about \u2013 who do we as an American public decide gets to join our national community? And if the Secretary of State and the President decide, \u2018This person shouldn\u2019t be in America, and they have no legal right to stay here,\u2019 it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nA green card holder, even if I may like that green card holder, doesn\u2019t have an indefinite right to be in the United States of America. U.S. Vice President JD Vance in a recent interview with Fox News\n\nMcBean Pompy, who\u2019s based in White Plains, New York, and frequently posts her analyses of immigration issues on social media, shared a clip of Vance\u2019s remarks with her followers, describing the vice president\u2019s comments as \u201ca shocking new standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen our policymakers speak about this issue in such a loose way, it makes me a little uncomfortable,\u201d she told CNN, \u201cbecause there are very strict rules governing a green card holder\u2019s rights and abilities in the United States, and I just want to make sure that we\u2019re following due process.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re scared about upcoming travel plans\n\nMarina Sinden, a green card holder in Washington state who\u2019s married to a US citizen, is looking forward to visiting her family in Canada for Easter. But the 37-year-old tattoo artist says she\u2019s not looking forward to what she fears might happen when she tries to return to her US home afterward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really concerned about making the crossing back into the United States. \u2026 I have an entire world here to lose if I\u2019m not allowed to re-enter,\u201d Sinden says.\n\nEscalating tensions between the US and Canada, plus a recent report of a Canadian woman who was detained at the border for 12 days, are weighing on her.\n\nI\u2019m really concerned about making the crossing back into the United States. \u2026 I have an entire world here to lose if I\u2019m not allowed to re-enter. Marina Sinden, a green card holder in Washington state who's planning to travel to Canada soon\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about going through an experience like that,\u201d Sinden says. \u201cI own a home here. I own a brick-and-mortar business. I have vehicles. I have children in school. And I have a daughter who says the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States flag every single day.\u201d\n\nSinden says she worries a clerical error in her file from a past green card application could cause confusion, even though she resolved that problem in court, her current green card is valid and she has no criminal record.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that no matter what I\u2019ve done to do the right things (and) respect the rules\u2026 I could have my entire life taken from me for a clerical issue \u2026 where something was misfiled one time incorrectly,\u201d she says.\n\nMarina Sinden says she has a green card, but still worries she could be detained by US immigration officials. Courtesy Marina Sinden\n\nThe stress is something that\u2019s difficult for those who haven\u2019t dealt directly with the US immigration system to understand, says Maria, a 38-year-old business owner in Colorado. She asked to be identified only by her first name out of concern that speaking out could jeopardize her legal status in the US.\n\nMaria told CNN she came to the US from Costa Rica when she was 5 years old. She has a green card now, but as a child she was undocumented for years after her family overstayed their visas.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling like we couldn\u2019t go to the doctor, we couldn\u2019t go do anything, because the fear of deportation was so real,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, and now, oh my God, all my childhood traumas and fears are being reignited and lived again \u2014 something I never thought I\u2019d have to deal with ever again.\u201d\n\nAm I still scared? Yes. Maria, a green card holder in Colorado whose attorney advised her that traveling abroad is safe\n\nThis week, as she prepared to put down a deposit to attend an important work conference abroad, Maria called her lawyer. Even with the green card she\u2019s had for years, the situation feels increasingly uncertain, she says.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018It\u2019s fine, you\u2019re OK, you can go,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut am I still scared? Yes.\u201d\n\nWhat immigration attorneys are telling clients about travel\n\nFor immigration attorney Charles Kuck, it\u2019s a telling sign of the times. The last time he received so many calls from concerned legal residents, he says, was after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.\n\nIn recent weeks, Kuck says he\u2019s been fielding numerous calls from clients with green cards \u2014 and working to reassure them.\n\n\u201cGreen card holders should be fine,\u201d Kuck says. \u201cUnless they\u2019re engaging in activities that (Secretary of State) Marco Rubio would consider to be terrorism, I think they\u2019re absolutely OK. And that\u2019s the vast majority of people.\u201d\n\nCommercial trucks head towards the US Customs and Border Protection Pacific Highway Port of Entry from south Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, November 26, 2024. Jennifer Gauthier/Reuters\n\nGreen card holders largely have the same rights as US citizens, he says, \u201cunless \u2014 and there\u2019s always an unless \u2014 they\u2019ve committed a crime. If they\u2019ve committed a crime, then they do not have the right to re-enter the United States without being subject to being questioned and maybe put into deportation proceedings.\u201d\n\nThey also don\u2019t have the right to live indefinitely outside the country, he says.\n\nGreen card holders should be fine. Unless they\u2019re engaging in activities that (Secretary of State) Marco Rubio would consider to be terrorism, I think they\u2019re absolutely OK. And that\u2019s the vast majority of people. Charles Kuck, immigration attorney\n\nMcBean Pompy says she advises green card holders not to stay outside the US longer than six months. If they do, she says, it\u2019s possible for the US government \u201cto allege that they have abandoned their residency.\u201d Also, green card holders who are in removal proceedings shouldn\u2019t travel, she says. And she advises clients not to sign any documents at the airport, especially if they don\u2019t understand them.\n\nLeopold says the advice he\u2019s giving to clients varies depending on their circumstances. He\u2019s advised many visa holders to hold off on travel, particularly given the possibility that new travel bans are coming soon from the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIf I were not a citizen, I would think long and hard before I traveled. And that includes green card holders. It\u2019s less of a risk, obviously, for a green card holder to travel, because you do have more rights with the green card, and it\u2019s much harder to keep a green card holder out of the country,\u201d he says. \u201cBut anybody who\u2019s got blemishes on their record, a conviction, even misdemeanor convictions, they should not travel unless they\u2019ve talked to counsel.\u201d\n\nA vehicle is pictured at the US Customs and Border Protection \u2013 Derby Line Port of Entry at the Canada-U.S. border between the U.S. state of Vermont and the Canadian province of Quebec. Carlos Osorio/Reuters\n\nTo some, even staying in the US doesn\u2019t feel safe\n\nDeciding it wasn\u2019t safe to leave the US and attend her father\u2019s funeral in Cameroon a few weeks ago was heartbreaking, a 40-year-old green card holder in the Midwest told CNN this week.\n\nOn top of her grief, watching recent news and social media posts on her phone has left her feeling devastated and uncertain about her life as an immigrant in this country, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen I got my green card, I thought everything was going to be OK for me. \u2026 Lately, with all that\u2019s been going on, I don\u2019t even know,\u201d the woman said. She asked to be identified only by her first initial, L, because she came to the US seeking asylum and is worried speaking out could endanger her family.\n\n\u201cWhen we see what is happening, the number of people that are being deported, it\u2019s really scary for us,\u201d L said.\n\nDemonstrators hold signs outside of the Rhode Island State House to protest the deportation of doctor and Brown University assistant professor Rasha Alawieh on March 17. US Customs and Border Protection said Alawieh had attended the public funeral in Lebanon of Hassan Nasrallah , the long-time leader of Hezbollah, and a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged she expressed support of Nasrallah to CBP officers. Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n\nAfter Khalil\u2019s recent arrest, a green card holder of Palestinian descent told CNN they\u2019re feeling worried about walking outside their New England home wearing a keffiyeh \u2014 let alone traveling internationally. They asked to be identified by the initial K out of fear that speaking out could jeopardize their immigration case.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even be guaranteed that in my home an agent won\u2019t come in and forcibly remove me because the President or the Secretary of State deems someone a threat \u2026 It\u2019s really hard to feel safe when that\u2019s what we\u2019re being told,\u201d K said, adding that reports of other arrests and deportations have only intensified fears.\n\n\u201cAnd I think the intent was fear,\u201d K said. \u201cThat was very much intentional \u2014 to have people afraid to speak out, to have people afraid to exercise the freedoms that are rightfully theirs to take part in.\u201d\n\n\u2018You will see a lot more people applying for citizenship\u2019\n\nIn addition to questions about whether they can safely travel and whether their green cards can be taken away, immigration attorneys say these days they\u2019re also getting more questions from green card holders about becoming US citizens.\n\n\u201cI think you will see a lot more people applying for citizenship than might normally have applied,\u201d Kuck says.\n\nOfficials estimate that more than two-thirds of the almost 13 million green card holders in the US are eligible to become citizens.\n\nBut despite their eligibility, some of her clients are more hesitant now to pursue citizenship, McBean Pompy says.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making a decision \u2014 \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to wait and see how things shake out with this administration before I really try to move forward with it,\u2019 because they don\u2019t want to be caught up in any of the major changes,\u201d she says.\n\nImmigrants wait for a naturalization ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 11. Attorneys say they expect more people to apply for citizenship amid growing uncertainty. Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nMaria, the Colorado business owner, says now it feels like becoming a citizen is the only way to keep her family safe and make sure her 12-year-old son doesn\u2019t have to deal with the same worries she faced as a child. Soon she\u2019s planning to begin the paperwork.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be separated from my family,\u201d she says.\n\nSinden says she sees things differently. She considered becoming a US citizen before. And she\u2019ll be eligible to apply this month. But escalating tensions with her home country, she says, have made her feel so unwelcome in the US that becoming a citizen now feels like a step too far.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the current policies and the aggression towards my country. I don\u2019t know how far that\u2019s going to go,\u201d she says.\n\nSo instead of taking steps toward US citizenship, Sinden is opting for something even more permanent than a green card.\n\nShe recently tattooed a Canadian maple leaf on the palm of her hand.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jennifer Hauser contributed to this report.",

Although hotel registration forms that never allow enough space for your email come a close second \u2014 I\u2019m here to relax, not work!\n\nThe first nail in the, er, sunbed is queueing up at a country\u2019s high commission or visa centre with your application only to be told you\u2019ve forgotten to name your neighbour\u2019s next of kin. Or, heaven forbid, you have failed to print off the appointment letter upside down and back to front and, sorry, but you\u2019ll have to come back in another three months. I\u2019m exaggerating, but only a bit.\n\nI\u2019ve lost count of the number of hours I\u2019ve wasted filling in arcane visa applications, mostly through gritted teeth, then worrying that I\u2019ve got my passport expiry date wrong or misspelt my middle name. Then there\u2019s standing in a long line at airports to pay for a \u201cvisa on arrival\u201d, which often feels more like extortion than travel authorisation. OK, fine, it might only be 35 quid and in the grand scheme of a nice holiday it doesn\u2019t add much to the bottom line, but still. It\u2019s annoying.\n\nMercifully, tourist e-visas have made the process easier GETTY IMAGES\n\nI\u2019m sure there are perfectly good reasons for requiring a visa, but it seems a bit much if you\u2019re just going to lie on a beach for a week (as I usually do). Mercifully tourist e-visas for many countries have made the process quicker and easier, but they often still require five pages of information about my grandparents and my school record. Some real life examples: did need to write that handwritten note to the Chinese government to say sorry for going on a city break in Istanbul five years prior? Why does the India visa form ask for everywhere you\u2019ve been in the past ten years but only give you enough space to write \u201cFrance, Ita\u201d? And why does the US\u2019s Esta form ask if you\u2019re a terrorist \u2014 do some people actually tick \u201cyes\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Which countries are visa-free for UK passport holders? Here\u2019s the full list\n\nThere will soon be more red tape on this side of the Pond. Last week, a final(ish) date was set for Europe\u2019s new and much-delayed Entry and Exit System (EES), a new digital border record that will replace passport stamps. From October, Brits visiting the Schengen bloc will need to register passport information and biometrics (such as fingerprints) before travel, and repeat this every three years. This will be followed in 2026 by the \u00a36 Etias visa waiver, which is similar to the US\u2019s Esta and will require all Brits to pay every three years for entry to Europe. Do keep up!\n\n\u201cThis ongoing uncertainty is creating confusion for travellers about what these systems will mean for them and how they might affect upcoming EU travel plans,\u201d said Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, which represents independent travel agents. \u201cWith different rules and visa requirements for destinations across the world, travel can at times seem more complicated than ever.\u201d\n\nVisas probably won\u2019t put me or other holidaying Brits off, but they still have the capacity to make the palms sweat. I\u2019ve just applied for an e-visa for a country I\u2019m visiting at Easter (but which will remain nameless in case they read this). It was \u00a342, and the approval came through in about ten minutes.

            "content": "Updated at 3:05 pm E.T. on March 22, 2025\n\nEven as Donald Trump advertises his hard-line approach to border crossers, he is actively soliciting one particular group of immigrants: rich ones. In February, Trump proposed that America start offering a U.S. \u201cgold card\u201d for $5 million. \u201cGreen-card privileges, plus\u201d is how the president described it: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country,\u201d he said. Trump predicted that the United States could sell a million of these cards, enough to eliminate the national debt. Even Russian oligarchs could be eligible, he said\u2014though (thanks to economic sanctions) \u201cthey\u2019re not quite as wealthy as they used to be.\u201d\n\nTrump seemed to relish the scheme\u2019s shock value. But these days, buying a visa or passport is not controversial: About half of the world\u2019s nations already offer visas, permanent residence, or even full citizenship for sums ranging from the low five to low seven figures. The U.S. itself grants up to 10,000 residency permits a year under its EB-5 investor visa program, which Congress has approved until 2027 and costs applicants about $1 million.\n\nBut if Trump expects a flood of takers, he has it backwards: The international rich aren\u2019t trying to come here, so much as Americans are trying to get out. U.S. citizens now represent the majority of clients looking for an exit, through foreign citizenship, permanent residence, or a visa that allows them to live abroad.\n\nI have been writing about the world of millionaire migration for years. The market depends on a cottage industry of advisers, financial planners, and lawyers who help their clients navigate the paperwork and requirements, and I spoke with some of these experts in the weeks following Trump\u2019s announcement. All seemed to think that only a handful of people would take Trump\u2019s bait\u2014mainly because there simply aren\u2019t enough people rich enough to shell out $5 million with no return on their investment.\n\nDominic Volek, an executive at the consulting firm Henley & Partners, told me that his clients typically \u201clook at investing 10 percent of their net worth on citizenship or residence.\u201d To consider the gold card, they\u2019d need \u201ca liquid net worth of $50 million, and there are only around 300,000 people globally who have that kind of money.\u201d Even then, gold cards will succeed only \u201cif America\u2019s relaxed about the source of funds,\u201d another lawyer, Sam Bayat, who works with a lot of clients in the Middle East, told me. Shady Russian oligarchs, in other words, might be the target demographic, rather than an edge case.\n\nThe far bigger story is the reverse phenomenon: Thousands of Americans a year are applying to visa programs abroad, primarily in Europe\u2014Portugal in particular\u2014and the Caribbean, where island nations offer citizenship outright, sometimes upon purchase of property. An American doctor or dentist considering a second home in storm-addled Florida might now buy a $325,000 condo in St. Kitts and Nevis instead and, in the bargain, qualify for the island nation\u2019s citizenship in as little as three months. A nature lover might look to Costa Rica, which grants residence (and a fast track to citizenship) for $150,000. Vanuatu will effectively sell you a passport for $130,000; Dominica\u2019s costs $200,000.\n\nAlana Semuels: Should Congress let wealthy foreigners buy green cards?\n\nHistorically, people have looked to buy a different citizenship because they live under undemocratic political systems, or because their passport makes it difficult to travel. (Afghans, for instance, can go to just six countries without a visa; Spaniards can go to 133.) Eric Major, the CEO of the immigration-advising firm Latitude, began his career helping rich Hong Kongers make exit plans to relocate to Canada or the United Kingdom ahead of the territory\u2019s scheduled handover to China. \u201cThe smart capital, the top guys in Hong Kong in the 1990s, were all saying, \u2018We gotta hedge,\u2019\u201d Major told me, referring to fears that China would crack down on business and political freedoms. Major went on to work mainly with clients from China, Russia, India, and the Middle East.\n\nToday most of Major\u2019s clients are American. Volek\u2019s firm has more clients from America than from the next four biggest feeder countries (Pakistan, Nigeria, India, and the U.K.) combined. Fifteen years ago, the firm did not see much point in opening a U.S. office. This year, it\u2019s launching its tenth. \u201cI never would have imagined my No. 1 source market would become America,\u201d Major told me. \u201cBut now the top brass of America is hedging.\u201d\n\nHedging is the operative word: Few of these Americans are actually moving abroad at the moment. It\u2019s about having options, Volek said: \u201cIt\u2019s purely the realization that, \u2018I\u2019m wealthy and diversified in terms of assets, bonds, and equities, so why on earth would I have one country of citizenship and residence? It makes no sense.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe great American hedge began during the coronavirus pandemic. Overnight, U.S. citizens\u2014even the entitled ultrarich\u2014found themselves barred from entering other countries. \u201cI\u2019m worth $20, $50 million and I have a private jet and a home in Europe, and you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t enter?\u201d Volek recalls. That wasn\u2019t something Americans \u201chad contemplated before.\u201d\n\nThe emergency passed, and international travel picked back up. But the sense of uncertainty has persisted\u2014compounded by a spate of uniquely American tragedies: school shootings, high-profile displays of systemic racism, and the storming of the Capitol on January 6. Climate events such as hurricanes and wildfires have shaken homeowners, inflation has spooked investors, and the Trump-Biden-Trump whiplash has made politics feel more unpredictable than ever.\n\nNow, as Elon Musk attacks the federal government\u2019s social and regulatory programs, the U.S. is beginning to take on the contours of a nation without a clear future. \u201cIt\u2019s the same push factors as other countries,\u201d Major explained. \u201cPeople don\u2019t trust the government; they\u2019re worried about the quality of the air; they want to educate their kids.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to exaggerate how meaningful this shift has been for the mobility industry. I\u2019ve been talking to people like Volek and Major since 2012, and I published the first book on the market for passports in 2015. I would always run into the occasional American looking to expatriate, but they tended to be eccentrics, such as a man known as \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d and subscribers to newsletters such as Nomad Capitalist. These Americans weren\u2019t worried about gun violence and political stability. They were hard-core libertarians who wanted to avoid taxes at all costs. Many would go on to renounce their U.S. citizenship after acquiring their foreign one.\n\nAs the people looking to move have changed, so too has the mobility industry, which has far more options now and is far more accessible and socially acceptable. \u201cThe overall trend is toward more legitimacy and people realizing it\u2019s totally normal\u201d to pay to emigrate, Kristin Surak, a sociologist at the London School of Economics and Political Science and the author of The Golden Passport, told me.\n\nJonathan Lemire: Elon Musk is president\n\nAmericans without a ton of money are finding ways to access new passports by re-hyphenating themselves. Many are casting around for long-lost relatives through which they can claim Italian, Irish, Austrian, or German citizenship. Tracking down birth certificates from the old country and persuading embassies to accept them as proof of citizenship used to be logistically complicated; now there are consultants to help with that too. European countries have grown accustomed to American applicants who want to expand their options and lower the cost of college, health care, and child care.\n\nAccording to one estimate, about 40 percent of U.S. citizens might be eligible for European passports through their ancestors. Last year, Ireland received 31,825 passport applications from U.S. citizens, Austria naturalized 1,914 (virtually all as reparations for Nazi-era persecutions), and more than 6,100 Americans applied for British citizenship, with a noticeable uptick beginning in November.\n\n\u201cAmericans have gotten very pragmatic,\u201d says Audra DeFalco, who specializes in \u201ccitizenship by descent\u201d at Latitude. \u201cThey\u2019re retirees, people whose grandma was Polish and they really loved their grandma; some want to study abroad without having student loans.\u201d\n\nMore and more, DeFalco says, the Americans with an exit plan are just people who have the time and resources to make one.\n\nWhen I spoke with Charlie, a businessman from the Midwest who is in the process of obtaining a Portuguese \u201cgolden visa,\u201d I was struck by what I saw in the background of his video. He wasn\u2019t Zooming from a sterile condo in a glass tower in some anonymous global capital, or a fancy hotel room on his way someplace else. He was sitting in the cozy-looking living room of the suburban house he\u2019d lived in for years.\n\n\u201cWe have four kids and two grandsons, who all live very close, and we spend an inordinate amount of time with our family,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the central focus of our lives.\u201d (He asked to go by a pseudonym in case speaking publicly would interfere with his visa application.)\n\nCharlie\u2019s done well enough as an entrepreneur to afford a pricey Plan B, but he isn\u2019t a jet-setting oligarch or a paranoid crypto bro. He\u2019s a Kamala Harris voter (\u201cobviously\u201d), he\u2019s Jewish (\u201cwe go to synagogue on occasion\u201d), and he loves living in America, where he\u2019s part of a tight-knit community. Still, he\u2019s almost at the end of the year-long process to purchase a Portuguese residence permit, which begins with investing about $540,000 in the country.\n\nWhat pushed him to look outside the United States was his growing fear for his safety. Charlie told me that he feels threatened by both the Nazi-saluting right and the Gaza-protesting left. \u201cI have enough knowledge of history to know and to believe that people who say \u2018It could never happen here\u2019 are daydreaming,\u201d he said.\n\n(I asked him why he hadn\u2019t simply taken Israeli citizenship, which is available to all Jews, would cost him next to nothing, and was quite literally created for this purpose. \u201cI don\u2019t know that my wife particularly savored the idea of living there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in her mind an ideal place.\u201d)\n\nLately, though, his fears have gone way beyond anti-Semitism \u201cto being scared of where our country is going and whether the forces of good will eventually win out over the bullshit that\u2019s tearing down the government,\u201d he said. He sees an escape hatch as common sense, not traitorous. He told me that he\u2019d \u201ceven inspired\u201d a few of his friends to look into it.\n\nKrishnadev Calamur: The EU wants to clamp down on the super rich\u2019s visa of choice\n\nMina Hsiao and Chris Carter are a couple nearing retirement age. They recently returned to San Diego after spending most of the past 16 years in Shanghai, but within months, they had applied for a visa to live in Sarawak, on the Malaysian island of Borneo. The permit lasts 10 years and costs about $33,500 a person. Applicants must also have health insurance and be able to financially support themselves.\n\nThe couple had been looking forward to their homecoming, but it quickly became clear that the U.S. they\u2019d left was not the same country that was waiting for them. Hsiao felt unsafe as an Asian woman, particularly when she went out wearing a mask. Carter\u2019s family was divided along political lines. Even their church felt like a minefield. \u201cWe were hopeful until November,\u201d Carter recalled. \u201cBut after I saw how many people voted for Trump, after the first term, after January 6\u2014and people of faith in the church embracing Christian nationalism \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Christianity that somehow has morphed in this country is not our expression of faith,\u201d Hsiao interjected. \u201cWe thought we were coming back to a psychological home, not just the comfort of language but also ideals\u2014security, opportunity for all. And that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\nHow long do they envision staying abroad? \u201cAt least three years, nine months, and two weeks,\u201d Carter joked. \u201cBut things will not go back to pre-Trump,\u201d Hsiao added. \u201cThat\u2019s our concern.\u201d\n\nKate, who works at a pharmaceutical company in Boston, is establishing European residence through the same visa program as Charlie (and she asked me to use a pseudonym for the same reason). She moved to the United States from Ukraine in 2000 after her family struggled to adjust to post-Soviet turmoil, and got American citizenship soon after.\n\nShe is in her 50s now, and started thinking about relocating a few years ago, when she had some extra cash after downsizing her home. \u201cI thought maybe Cape Cod would be a good investment,\u201d she said, \u201cbut then my cousin, a lawyer in Manhattan, said, \u2018Don\u2019t do Cape Cod. Buy something in Europe and get a citizenship.\u201d\n\nThen, in January, she saw a message on social media about federal workers being asked \u201cto stay loyal or resign,\u201d Kate told me. She \u201ccompletely freaked out\u201d and sent it to her family, commenting: \u201cPerestroika in one week.\u201d She\u2019s now in the process of applying for permanent residence in Portugal.\n\n\u201cI have my job in America, so there\u2019s no rush to move,\u201d Kate said. \u201cBut I fear civil war.\u201d She told me she felt lucky not to be in Ukraine, \u201cbut seeing how polarized America has become\u2014it makes me wonder about the way forward.\u201d\n\nWhether these Americans will really leave remains to be seen. Charlie said his greatest hope is that he won\u2019t have to. But he finds comfort in knowing that he has the option of escape if the worst ever comes to pass, and in the idea that if he does have to go, he won\u2019t be alone. He said he tells his family members: \u201cIf it gets so bad that we feel the obligation to leave the country, we believe it\u2019ll be bad enough that they\u2019ll want to go as well.\u201d",

            "content": "US Visa Review Process and Travel Restrictions Want to Know More About the Latest Updates and How They Impact Your Travel Plans?\n\nIn recent updates regarding U.S. visa policies, it was made clear that there was no specific deadline set for completing the ongoing review process of U.S. visas. There had been much speculation around whether any travel restrictions would be imposed; however, authorities explained that there were no current deadlines for any such measures. The U.S. government also made it clear that it was prioritizing the safety and security of the nation, ensuring that travelers entering the country do not pose any threats to national security or public safety.\n\nNo Immediate Plans for Travel Restrictions\n\nDuring a recent press conference, it was revealed that no immediate travel restrictions would be enforced. Authorities stated that any decisions regarding these restrictions would be made following thorough investigations, and details would be provided once the review process was concluded. The U.S. government underscored that it was committed to ensuring that foreign travelers are properly vetted and pose no threat to the country.\n\nThis has brought clarity to concerns surrounding travel to the U.S., especially from countries whose citizens have been subjected to heightened scrutiny in the past. As of now, there have been no updates indicating any new visa bans.\n\nU.S. Position on Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program\n\nA significant part of the discussions also included the U.S. stance on Iran and its nuclear program. Authorities reiterated that the U.S. would not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons under any circumstances. The U.S. has exerted considerable diplomatic pressure on Iran, emphasizing that the country must cease its support of terrorist organizations worldwide. The efforts align with the broader U.S. strategy to address national security threats, which, according to officials, also plays a role in shaping visa and travel policies.\n\nThis pressure on Iran highlights the ongoing geopolitical concerns that have an impact on broader travel regulations. As global tensions remain high, countries such as Iran are monitored closely, influencing how the U.S. approaches travel and visa policies.\n\nMonitoring Global Developments: U.S. Attention on Syria\n\nIn terms of international developments, the U.S. has expressed particular concern about the ongoing situation in Syria. Officials have stressed that they are closely monitoring the conflict and expect individuals like Ahmed Al-Sharaa to uphold the rights of all citizens. The U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring the safety of its citizens abroad while also continuing to monitor situations in countries that are currently experiencing political instability.\n\nThe shifting global landscape and the U.S. government\u2019s involvement in international affairs have implications for travel policies, particularly in regions with active conflicts. The attention on Syria is just one example of how international relations influence the travel industry and visa regulations.\n\nClarification on Pakistan and U.S. Visa Policies\n\nFurther clarifying the situation, Pakistan\u2019s Minister of State for Law and Justice, Barrister Aqeel Malik, addressed concerns about the possibility of the U.S. imposing travel restrictions on Pakistan. In a local interview, the minister explained that no such travel ban was being imposed on Pakistan. The concerns regarding potential travel restrictions stemmed from viral lists circulating recently, suggesting that countries like Pakistan would face tougher travel scrutiny. However, these concerns were dispelled, with officials asserting that there were no immediate plans to impose travel bans.\n\nInstead, the U.S. is currently reviewing its visa policies as part of broader efforts to strengthen border security and enhance national security. The minister also noted that this review process was not targeted at any specific country, including Pakistan. Additionally, the U.S. State Department reinforced this message, clarifying that the review is part of an ongoing global trend of stricter immigration controls rather than any discriminatory measures against individual countries.\n\nA Global Trend: Tightened Immigration Controls\n\nThe recent discourse surrounding the U.S. visa review process reflects a global trend toward tightening immigration policies. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have recently enacted stricter visa policies, a trend that reflects broader global efforts to enhance national security and control immigration. The tightening of these controls is not unique to any one region but is becoming more widespread, affecting travelers from various countries.\n\nThe ongoing global trend of stricter immigration measures signals a significant shift in the travel industry. For international travelers, these changes suggest that they will need to navigate increasingly complex visa policies and border control procedures. As governments implement tighter immigration regulations, travelers will likely experience delays and more scrutiny when crossing borders, especially when dealing with countries that have strained relations with other nations.\n\nDiplomatic Engagement: Pakistan\u2019s Active Role\n\nDespite these global trends, Pakistan is actively engaging in diplomatic discussions with U.S. authorities to ensure that the country\u2019s interests are safeguarded. As part of this diplomatic dialogue, Pakistan is taking steps to address the broader issue of border security and strengthen its position in relation to U.S. visa policies. These efforts reflect the broader diplomatic and international relations landscape that impacts global travel.\n\nTravelers from Pakistan and other countries with ongoing diplomatic discussions with the U.S. may experience changes in travel policies, which could lead to shifts in how their visa applications are processed and evaluated. It also suggests that Pakistan is working to ensure that its citizens are not disproportionately affected by any future changes to U.S. visa policies.\n\nImplications for the Travel Industry\n\nThe evolving situation surrounding U.S. visa policies and travel restrictions has significant implications for the global travel industry. Travelers may face increasing challenges in navigating immigration procedures, especially as governments around the world enforce tighter border controls. This will likely lead to delays, increased costs, and more complex travel planning, as individuals from countries with strained diplomatic relations may face additional scrutiny.\n\nFurthermore, these developments underscore the growing importance of security in shaping international travel. As countries tighten their visa policies and border security measures, the travel industry must adapt to these changes. Travelers will need to stay informed about the latest regulations and be prepared for more stringent requirements when traveling internationally.\n\nShare On:",

Khalil, 30, a legal U.S. resident without a criminal record, was detained overnight in New Jersey before being transferred to an immigration facility in Jena, Louisiana.\n\nInitially, ICE planned to revoke Khalil's student visa based on instructions from the U.S. State Department but discovered he was also a lawful permanent resident. Consequently, ICE pursued revoking his green card instead, and he currently awaits a deportation hearing in Louisiana, according to the AP.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security confirmed Khalil's detention was related to President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at combating antisemitism on college campuses. Khalil's arrest has drawn criticism, with opponents arguing he is unfairly targeted, raising questions about protections for international students and green card holders.\n\nJaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told AP that lawful permanent residents generally have robust protections and \"should be the most protected short of a U.S. citizen.\" However, Kelley-Widmer emphasized that protection is not absolute; green card holders can be deported for crimes, failure to update addresses with immigration authorities, or fraudulent marriages.\n\nIn Khalil's case, the U.S. government claims authority to revoke his residency, obtained through marriage to a U.S. citizen. His deportation is pursued under Section 237 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allowing removal if the Secretary of State determines a non-citizen's presence or activities could have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S., as reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhile officials have not explicitly detailed how Khalil threatens U.S. foreign policy, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other Trump administration officials support deportation, accusing him of creating a hostile environment for Jewish students at Columbia University. Combatting antisemitism has been a prominent foreign policy objective for Trump's administration.\n\nBrazilians deported from the U.S. at Eduardo Gomes International Airport in Manaus, Amazona, on Jan. 25, 2025. Photo by AFP\n\nKhalil is not alone in facing deportation due to stricter immigration enforcement. Recently, multiple green card and visa holders have faced detention at U.S. entry points and prolonged stays in ICE facilities.\n\nRasha Alawieh, 34, a kidney transplant specialist at Brown University's medical school, was detained last week at Boston Logan International Airport after returning from Lebanon.\n\nHer H-1B work visa issued by the U.S. consulate in Lebanon was revoked, and she was deported.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security claimed on X on March 17 that Alawieh had \"traveled to Beirut, Lebanon, to attend the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah,\" the leader of Hezbollah. Alawieh maintained that she only joined crowds outside the stadium where the funeral occurred and did not attend the ceremony inside, AFP reported, citing an unnamed family member.\n\nIn another incident, Fabian Schmidt, a 34-year-old German electrical engineer and green card holder residing in New Hampshire, was detained on March 7 at Boston Logan Airport upon returning from Europe. His mother alleged that CBP officers \"violently interrogated\" Schmidt and pressured him into signing away his green card, according to Boston public radio WGBH. Schmidt was transferred to an ICE detention center in Rhode Island.\n\nImmigration officials cited Schmidt's prior marijuana possession charge from 2015 in California, before the state legalized recreational cannabis, as justification for deportation. Schmidt, who moved from Germany to the U.S. in 2008 and received his green card in 2009, missed a related court hearing in California because the summons was sent to his former address after he moved to New Hampshire in 2022. Schmidt believed the charge had been dismissed following cannabis decriminalization.\n\nHis family emphasized that Schmidt had turned his life around, building a stable engineering career and raising an 8-year-old daughter with his American partner, both U.S. citizens, according to WGBH. However, CBP officials argued that his prior drug-related offense warranted deportation.\n\nHilton Beckham, Assistant Commissioner of Public Affairs at CBP, refuted Schmidt's family\u2019s allegations, telling Newsweek: \"These claims [regarding Schmidt] are blatantly false with respect to CBP. When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.\"\n\nStrict immigration enforcement under Trump has intensified scrutiny of green card and visa holders, sparking concerns about due process. Legal experts warn that expansive interpretations of immigration laws could result in deportations for minor infractions or subjective policy reasons.\n\nCivil rights organizations and immigration attorneys continue to challenge the administration's actions, arguing many legal immigrants face unfair targeting.\n\nKripa Upadhyay, a Seattle-based immigration attorney, cautioned earlier this week in the Times of India that foreign nationals, especially those renewing H-1B or F-1 visas, should \"really need to think twice\" about international travel.\n\nAshwin Sharma, a Florida immigration lawyer, described incidents reported to the newspaper, where elderly Indian green card holders were allegedly pressured by CBP agents into signing Form I-407, voluntarily relinquishing their residency. Sharma noted some CBP officers intimidate travelers with threats of detention or deportation, despite only an immigration judge legally having authority to revoke a green card.\n\nImmigration attorneys also report increased extensive questioning and detention for green card holders, advising them to pursue U.S. citizenship promptly. Those awaiting citizenship approval are advised against international travel until obtaining their American passports.\n\nLucas Sielaff, 25, from eastern Germany, shared his trouble after taking a short trip out of the U.S.\n\nSielaff told Der Spiegel magazine earlier this month, as reported by DW, that was detained for two weeks and deported back to Germany after visiting his American fianc\u00e9e in Nevada. The couple had briefly traveled to Mexico to obtain veterinary care for her dog.\n\nUpon returning, Sielaff faced intense interrogation. He believed the border officer assumed he was illegally residing in the U.S. and attempting to circumvent the 90-day visitation limit by briefly exiting the country.",

Balance transfers must be completed within 60 days of account opening to qualify. Once the intro APR expires, a variable 17.74% to 28.74% APR applies. The card charges a balance transfer fee of 5% of the amount of each transfer with a $5 minimum. Although this fee runs on the high side, the length of the intro-APR period means you'll likely offset the transfer fee with the interest payments you save on for two years. In terms of rewards, the card earns 4% cash back on prepaid air, hotel and rental cars booked directly through the U.S. Bank Rewards Center. While this is a narrow set of purchases that earn cash back, it's better than some of the top intro-APR credit cards that earn no rewards. You also get several benefits through the card, including a $20 annual statement credit that you earn after making purchases for 11 consecutive months. There's no category restriction on the purchases that earn this credit, so it's incredibly easy to qualify for. You're also covered by the following insurance benefits: Cell phone protection\n\nRental car collision damage waiver\n\nExtended warranty protection\n\nPurchase security\n\nAlternative intro-APR cards to consider\n\nDepending on your current balance and interest rate, the Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card may be a cheaper option thanks to its lower balance transfer fee. It doesn't earn rewards or offer any notable benefits, but it has an intro balance transfer fee of 3% of the amount of each transfer with a $5 minimum for the first four months after account opening (after that, it increases to 5% with a $5 minimum). The tradeoff for the lower transfer fee is that the Citi Simplicity Card has a shorter 0% intro APR period for eligible balance transfers and purchases. So you'll start paying interest sooner than you would with the U.S. Bank card.\n\nCiti Simplicity\u00ae Card CNBC Select Rating 4.3 Learn More On Citi's site CNBC Select Rating 4.3 Learn More On Citi's site Spotlight Receive a 0% Intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and for 12 months on purchases.

            "content": "SAN DIEGO \u2014 Lennon Tyler and her German fianc\u00e9 often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day\u2019s drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship. But things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month. U.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense. They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Br\u00f6sche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said. On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend. Sielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily. Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he has never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured. \u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\u201d Rios said. U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren\u2019t simply denied entry. The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the \u201cevolving\u201d federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of non-essential travel for spring break, warning \u201cre-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.\u201d\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\u201d The agencies did not comment on the other cases. Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a waiver program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country. Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.\n\n\u201cMexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,\u201d Tyler said. They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff\u2019s 90-day tourist permit. When they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, \u201cWhere are you going? Where do you live?\u201d Tyler said. \u201cEnglish is not Lucas\u2019 first language and so he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Las Vegas,\u2019 and the agent says, \u2018Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d Tyler said, recounting what happened. Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car. After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts. During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.\n\nThere, he said, he shared a cell with eight others. \u201cYou are angry, you are sad, you don\u2019t know when you can get out,\u201d Sielaff said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get any answers from anybody.\u201d He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5. \u201cWhat happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol\u2019s power,\u201d Tyler said. Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11. \u201cShe\u2019s happy to be home,\u201d Paschen said. \u201cShe seems very relieved if anything but she\u2019s not coming back here anytime soon.\u201d On Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker on a trip across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.\n\nOn March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actress and entrepreneur who had a visa to work in the U.S., was detained at the Tijuana crossing. She was released Saturday, her friend Brittany Kors said. Before Mooney\u2019s release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying, \u201cIt certainly reinforces anxiety that many British Columbians have, and many Canadians have, about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.\u201d The detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration\u2019s arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza.

Sielaff said he and Tyler are now rethinking plans to hold their wedding in Las Vegas. He suffers nightmares and is considering therapy to cope with the trauma.\n\n\u201cNobody is safe there anymore to come to America as a tourist,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014Associated Press writer Rob Gillies reported from Toronto.",

The New York Times was the first to report the story but includes 43 countries in different categories.\n\nThe list divides countries into three different groups, each with differing levels of restrictions.\n\nThe first level faces full visa bans. It will affect 10 countries: Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.\n\nThe second level faces partial visa suspensions, affecting tourists, students and other visas. It will affect five countries, including: Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar and South Sudan.\n\nMore: Trump's first 30 days: Deported Guatemalan migrants suffer, White House touts progress\n\nThe third level affects countries for a partial suspension if their governments do not address deficiencies. It will affect 26 countries: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Belarus, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, East Timor, Turkmenistan and Vanuatu.\n\nCountries listed in the third group will be given 60 days to address the Trump administration's concerns.\n\nMore: Migrant encounters, drug seizures decline along US-Mexico border, CBP data shows\n\nThe list is likely to change. It must be approved by the Trump administration, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe visa ban echoes the executive order that became known as the Muslim ban issued during Trump's first term, which barred travel and refugee resettlement from various predominantly Muslim countries. The controversial travel ban was eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018.\n\nJeff Abbott covers the border for the El Paso Times and can be reached at:jdabbott@gannett.com;@palabrasdeabajo on Twitter or @palabrasdeabajo.bsky.social on Bluesky.",

            "content": "Immigration lawyers concerned about scrutiny, civil rights for green card and visa holders\n\nTwo recent cases of people with legal status being detained, or deported, after arriving at Boston Logan Airport following international travel are raising concerns for immigration lawyers about enforcement at the airport \u2013 a major hub for air travel in New Hampshire and the rest of the Northeast \u2013 and what these say about the rights of green card and visa holders under the current administration.\n\n\u201cThis administration from the beginning said that they were going to be targeting violent criminals, and that is not what we're seeing,\u201d said Manchester immigration lawyer Enrique Mesa. \u201cWe're just seeing them interrogate hard-working residents.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Fabian Schmidt, a New Hampshire resident and green card holder, was detained by Customs and Border Patrol at Boston Logan Airport after a trip to Luxembourg. He\u2019s currently being held at a facility in Rhode Island, and Schmidt\u2019s lawyer told The Public\u2019s Radio this week that he remains in \u201clegal limbo\u201d as he\u2019s waiting to find out if and what he has been charged with.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s case was followed by the case of Lebanese doctor Rasha Alawieh, who has an H-1B visa, a kind of visa typically reserved for workers with advanced expertise. Alawieh was detained over the weekend and sent back to Lebanon, despite a court order temporarily barring officials from sending her back.\n\nTraveling with a criminal record\n\nUnder the current circumstances, Mesa is advising his clients to think carefully about the risks of travelling, even if they have a green card. However, if a client must travel, Mesa tells his clients to make sure they take the documents that certify their status, like a resident card or extension notice if conditional residency has expired.\n\nIf a client has a criminal record, Mesa said it was important to bring a court-certified disposition showing the case has been dismissed or resolved. This was the case for Schmidt, who was likely to have been flagged by CBP for having a criminal record.\n\nGBH reported that Schmidt had a misdemeanor charge for having marijuana in his car in 2015, which was later dismissed after laws changed in California around marijuana possession. Schmidt\u2019s mother, Astrid Senior, told the outlet that he had also worked through and paid off a DUI from 10 years ago, and is successfully recovering from alcoholism.\n\nHilton Beckham, the assistant commissioner for public affairs at CBP, told GBH that officers will take \u201cproper action\u201d when someone has drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country.\n\nCBP has not responded to further questions about Schmidt from NHPR.\n\nJeff Joseph, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, has been in the field for more than two decades. He said the enhanced scrutiny during reentry is new. He explained permanent residents are usually admitted back into the country \u2013 with some exceptions like leaving the country during a deportation proceeding, giving up residence, or committing a crime while travelling outside the country.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge caveat to the universe now that when you travel, if you travel after having committed a crime, be prepared that you're going to be put in secondary screening and that it's going to be your burden to show that that particular crime doesn't make you ineligible to come into the country.\u201d\n\nScrutinizing conduct\n\nThese two cases come around the same time as public outcry over the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and permanent resident who was detained by Homeland Security, apparently for his prominent roles in protests at Columbia against Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nIn the case of the Rhode Island kidney transplant specialist sent back to Lebanon, the Department of Homeland said that Alawieh attended the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, a controversial religious figure and longtime secretary of Hezbollah. A spokesperson for the department added Alawieh also expressed support for Nasrallah.\n\n\u201cForeign nationals who promote extremist ideologies or carry terrorist propaganda are inadmissible to the U.S., plain and simple,\u201d CBP spokesperson Hilton Beckham said in a statement to NHPR.\n\nBeckham added a visa doesn\u2019t guarantee entry, and officers \u201cact swiftly to deny entry to those who glorify terrorist organizations, advocate violence, or openly support terrorist leaders and commemorate their deaths. Anyone found with extremist materials linked to a U.S.-designated terrorist group will be removed.\u201d\n\nFor Joseph, what\u2019s alarming about these cases is that conduct, and not criminal convictions, are being used to determine whether someone is deportable.\n\n\u201cAll of us Americans, foreign nationals who are in our country documented or undocumented, should be concerned about the fact that our conduct could, in fact, render us deportable or inadmissible,\u201d he said.\n\nJoseph said as U.S. foreign policy changes often, it can be near impossible to tell whether certain conduct \u2013 like attending a protest, or going to a funeral \u2013 will be frowned upon by future administrations.\n\nFirst Amendment concerns\n\nFor immigration lawyer Celine Atallah, the deportation of Alawieh is particularly concerning as a case about the freedom of speech and religion, both of which are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAs a Lebanese-American herself, Atallah also pointed out that Nasrallah was not only a political leader, but also viewed as a religious leader by many Shia Muslims. Since Alawieh also wears a veil, Atallah added that deporting Alawieh could be interpreted as religious discrimination.\n\nAtallah explained that immigration law finds people inadmissible to enter the country for \u201cmaterial support\u201d of terrorism, like money services, or logistics.\n\nSince Alawieh's record is sealed, there\u2019s still limited information available. However, based on what is available, Atallah said that going to a funeral shouldn\u2019t be enough to go against a court order. Because Alawieh didn\u2019t get the chance to argue her case in court, Atallah said that CBP\u2019s concerns over national security are a \u201cloophole\u201d that gets rid of her right to due process.\n\nThat makes Atallah grapple with the kind of message this sends to the world. She said people from across the world move to the United States to escape persecution. She added that taking action to punish immigrants for their beliefs goes against the country\u2019s founding principles.\n\n\u201cThis is what authoritarian regimes do. This is what happens in countries where dissent is criminalized, where people vanish for attending the wrong event, for speaking the wrong words. And now, we are doing it here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf freedom of expression is no longer protected here, and if federal agencies can openly defy court orders, then America is no longer America.\"\n\nThese articles are being shared by partners in the Granite State News Collaborative.

He also said, when pressed, that the visa holders would be \"properly vetted\" but seemingly started to add a caveat. \"You know, when you're talking about a lot of people \u2014 I think it's gonna be very successful.\"\n\nTrump has proposed the gold visas as a juiced-up replacement of the EB-5 visa, which already exists to allow foreign investors to obtain a green card if they invest at least $1.05 million in the U.S. Other countries with similar \"golden passports\" include Austria, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nThe proposal came even as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, targeted legal immigrants for deportation and contracted with El Salvador to send some deportees to a notorious prison complex.\n\nIn the interview, Ingraham also asked Trump why U.S. citizenship should be on sale \"for any amount of money\" and how it fit with his \"America First\" philosophy. Trump responded that he proposed the idea because he\u2019s \u201cAmerica First,\u201d claiming without evidence that the policy might even bring as many as 1 million new immigrants.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for MSNBC, Rotimi Adeoye laid out the moral and ethical objections to the proposal:\n\nIn Trump\u2019s vision, citizenship is no longer about building a shared national project; it is an asset reserved for those who can afford it, as it is in countries with \u201cgolden visa\u201d programs such as Malta and Cyprus. Being American would become a high-end commodity, available only to the wealthy.\n\nCritics have been outspoken in laying out their worries about this golden visa plan. But the Fox News interview shows that even Trump is concerned that the new visas could be abused and he has no real plan to stop that.",

Because of that, people using this program can be subject to mandatory detention.\n\nWhat rights do visitors have?\n\nU.S. federal law gives government agents the right to search people\u2019s property, including their phones and laptops, at border entry points. They do not need to be suspected of wrongdoing in order to be searched, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAll visitors have the right to remain silent. But the burden of proof rests with visa holders. For example, if an officer asks if someone plans to work on their tourist visa, and that person remains silent, the officer is likely to deny them entry, Mr. Joseph said.\n\nIf a person is found inadmissible during questioning, they can withdraw their intent to enter the country and may then be allowed to travel back to their home country. Their visa is canceled and they often get the next flight home. But an officer can deny the withdrawal, at which point the visitor is detained.\n\nBecause these confrontations occur technically outside the country, the rights outlined in the U.S. Constitution do not apply, Mr. Joseph said, and detainees are not necessarily entitled to a lawyer. The government has about 90 days to deport people. That period can be extended if detainees don\u2019t cooperate by providing the correct travel documents, at which point they can be subject to criminal proceedings.

            "content": "A heated debate has recently erupted between two groups of supporters of President Donald Trump. The dispute concerns the H-1B visa system, the program that allows U.S. employers to hire skilled foreign workers in specialty occupations \u2013 mostly in the tech industry.\n\nOn the one hand, there are people like Donald Trump\u2019s former strategist Steve Bannon, who has called the H-1B program a \u201ctotal and complete scam.\u201d On the other, there are tech tycoons like Elon Musk who think skilled foreign workers are crucial to the U.S. tech sector.\n\nThe H-1B visa program is subject to an annual limit of new visas it can issue, which sits at 65,000 per fiscal year. There is also an additional annual quota of 20,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled international students who have a proven ability to succeed academically in the United States.\n\nThe H-1B program is the primary vehicle for international graduate students at U.S. universities to stay and work in the United States after graduation. At Rice University, where I work, much of STEM research is carried out by international graduate students. The same goes for most American research-intensive universities.\n\nAs a computer science professor \u2013 and an immigrant \u2013 who studies the interaction between computing and society, I believe the debate over H-1B overlooks some important questions: Why does the U.S. rely so heavily on foreign workers for the tech industry, and why is it not able to develop a homegrown tech workforce?\n\nThe US as a global talent magnet\n\nThe U.S. has been a magnet for global scientific talent since before World War II.\n\nMany of the scientists who helped develop the atomic bomb were European refugees. After World War II, U.S. policies such as the Fulbright Program expanded opportunities for international educational exchange.\n\nAttracting international students to the U.S. has had positive results.\n\nAmong Americans who have won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, medicine or physics since 2000, 40% have been immigrants.\n\nTech industry giants Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google were all founded by first- or second-generation immigrants. Furthermore, immigrants have founded more than half of the nation\u2019s billion-dollar startups since 2018.\n\nStemming the inflow of students\n\nRestricting foreign graduate students\u2019 path to U.S. employment, as some prominent Trump supporters have called for, could significantly reduce the number of international graduate students in U.S. universities.\n\nAbout 80% of graduate students in American computer science and engineering programs \u2013 roughly 18,000 students in 2023 \u2013 are international students.\n\nThe loss of international doctoral students would significantly diminish the research capability of graduate programs in science and engineering. After all, doctoral students, supervised by principal investigators, carry out the bulk of research in science and engineering in U.S. universities.\n\nIt must be emphasized that international students make a significant contribution to U.S. research output. For example, scientists born outside the U.S. played key roles in the development of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. So making the U.S. less attractive to international graduate students in science and engineering would hurt U.S. research competitiveness.\n\nComputing Ph.D. graduates are in high demand. The economy needs them, so the lack of an adequate domestic pipeline seems puzzling.\n\nWhere have US students gone?\n\nSo, why is there such a reliance on foreign students for U.S. science and engineering? And why hasn\u2019t America created an adequate pipeline of U.S.-born students for its technical workforce?\n\nAfter discussions with many colleagues, I have found that there are simply not enough qualified domestic doctoral applicants to fill the needs of their doctoral programs.\n\nIn 2023, for example, U.S. computer science doctoral programs admitted about 3,400 new students, 63% of whom were foreign.\n\nIt seems as if the doctoral career track is simply not attractive enough to many U.S. undergrad computer science students. But why?\n\nThe top annual salary in Silicon Valley for new computer science graduates can reach US$115,000. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders in computing from Rice University have told me that until recently \u2013 before economic uncertainty shook the industry \u2013 they were getting starting annual salaries as high as $150,000 in Silicon Valley.\n\nDoctoral students in research universities, in contrast, do not receive a salary. Instead, they get a stipend. These vary slightly from school to school, but they typically pay less than $40,000 annually. The opportunity cost of pursuing a doctorate is, thus, up to $100,000 per year. And obtaining a doctorate typically takes six years.\n\nSo, pursuing a doctorate is not an economically viable decision for many Americans. The reality is that a doctoral degree opens new career options to its holder, but most bachelor\u2019s degree holders do not see beyond the economics. Yet academic computing research is crucial to the success of Silicon Valley.\n\nA 2016 analysis of the information technology sectors with a large economic impact shows that academic research plays an instrumental role in their development.\n\nWhy so little?\n\nThe U.S. is locked in a cold war with China focused mostly on technological dominance. So maintaining its research-and-development edge is in the national interest.\n\nYet the U.S. has declined to make the requisite investment in research. For example, the National Science Foundation\u2019s annual budget for computer and information science and engineering is around $1 billion. In contrast, annual research-and-development expenses for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, have been close to $50 billion for the past decade.\n\nUniversities are paying doctoral students so little because they cannot afford to pay more.\n\nBut instead of acknowledging the existence of this problem and trying to address it, the U.S. has found a way to meet its academic research needs by recruiting and admitting international students. The steady stream of highly qualified international applicants has allowed the U.S. to ignore the inadequacy of the domestic doctoral pipeline.\n\nThe current debate about the H-1B visa system provides the U.S. with an opportunity for introspection.\n\nYet the news from Washington, D.C., about massive budget cuts coming to the National Science Foundation seems to suggest the federal government is about to take an acute problem and turn it into a crisis.",

He had obtained an ESTA and had a been visiting his American fianc\u00e9e, Lennon Tyler, who lives in Las Vegas. She told reporters that they had traveled to Tijuana to obtain veterinary treatment for her dog. When they attempted to reenter the U.S., Tyler alleges that CBP officers became \u201cvery aggressive and hostile almost immediately.\u201d Sielaff has told reporters that owing to the language barrier, he incorrectly answered a question about where he lived and officers accused him of living in Las Vegas rather than visiting. His ESTA was ultimately canceled, and he was handcuffed and arrested. \u201cThere was no proof that I overstayed anything,\u201d he later told ABC-10 News.\n\nTyler told the New York Times that at the border crossing, after she tried to get answers about what was happening to her fianc\u00e9e, she was subjected to a body search by ICE officers and was briefly chained to a bench.\n\nSielaff said he was held by CBP at the border for two days before being transferred by ICE to the for-profit Otay Mesa Detention Center, where he shared a cell with eight other people. He was held for a total of 16 days before returning to Germany on March 6. Per the Times, Tyler says he was only able to get out because \u201cwe made ourselves a nuisance\u201d:\n\nDr. Tyler called the immigration authorities daily, she hired lawyers who also called them, she gave news media interviews and she reached out repeatedly to a German Consulate. [Eventually] Mr. Sielaff was allowed voluntary deportation, on a flight that cost him $2,744.\n\n.\n\nA 35-year-old Canadian entrepreneur attempted to enter to renew her work permit at the Mexican border and ended up detained for 12 days at two grim ICE facilities.\n\nThe details of her case are unusual. Jasmine Mooney, who once starred in a direct-to-video American Pie spinoff and more recently co-founded the American-based Holy Water! brand, said that while she was living in Vancouver, she discovered that her U.S. work permit had expired after three years. She decided to travel to Mexico to attempt to obtain a new permit at a San Ysidro border crossing, at which point her troubles began. The New York Times has a rundown of the complex logistics involved:\n\nMs. Mooney was applying for a TN visa, which allows professionals from Canada and Mexico to stay temporarily in the United States. She initially applied for one last year for her other marketing job, but she said that it had been rejected because the company\u2019s letterhead was missing from her documents.\n\nShe said she had successfully reapplied about a month later at the San Ysidro border crossing, but when she tried to return to the United States at the end of November, a U.S. immigration official at the airport in Vancouver revoked her visa. He explained that her application had not been processed properly, she said, and raised concerns over one company that was employing her that sold hemp-based products.\n\nMs. Mooney said it was not uncommon for people like her who work in Southern California to apply for visas at the San Ysidro border station, so earlier this month, she figured she would try again.\n\nMooney says that rather than simply denying her entry, ICE agents detained her for unclear reasons, then moved her to an ICE prison in Southern California before transferring her to one in Arizona a few days later. She described bleak conditions at both facilities, describing her conditions to People as \u201cinhumane\u201d and feeling like a \u201cdeeply disturbing psychological experiment.\u201d She describes being shackled for up to 24 hours in a row, sleeping on a mat with no blanket, having \u201caluminum foil wrapped over my body like a dead body for two and a half days,\u201d among other indignities.\n\nMooney says she was freed without explanation, and is still unsure why she was detained in the first place. She described her ordeal more thoroughly in a first-person article published in The Guardian on Wednesday.",

Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral fellow studying and teaching at the prestigious Washington DC institution on a student visa. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused him of \"spreading Hamas propaganda\" and having \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist\". Mr Suri's lawyer and employer have denied the allegation. His lawyer said in a court filing that his client was targeted because of his wife's \"identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech\".\n\nIn an order on Thursday, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Mr Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order\". In a sworn statement, his wife Mapheze Saleh said the detention \"has completely upended our lives\" and appealed to the court to allow Mr Suri to return home to his family. \"Our children are in desperate need of their father and miss him dearly,\" she said. \"As a mother of three children, I desperately need his support to take care of them and me.\" His arrest follows the detention or deportation of other foreign students and academics, including Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist. Mr Suri was arrested outside his home in northern Virginia on Monday night by masked immigration agents, according to legal filings seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner. He was told the agents were with DHS, the filings say, and they informed him the government had revoked his visa and he was now facing expulsion from the country. Mr Suri was taken to Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana where he is being held, according to US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, said on X that Mr Suri was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media\". She accused him of having \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas\" without providing any further detail.\n\nGeorgetown University\n\nMr Suri's father-in-law is a former adviser to killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, the Washington Post and New York Times reported. In her court statement, Ms Saleh said her father lived in the US for nearly 20 years while pursuing a master's and PhD. \"Afterward, he served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as the deputy of foreign affairs in Gaza,\" she said. Ms Saleh said he left the Gaza government in 2010 and \"started the House of Wisdom in 2011 to encourage peace and conflict resolution in Gaza\". Mr Suri's court filings allege that he and his wife Mapheze Saleh - a US citizen of Palestinian descent - had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\". The BBC has contacted Mr Suri's lawyer for more details. A spokesman for Georgetown University told the BBC that Mr Suri had been \"granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan\". The institution was \"not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention\". \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable,\" the spokesman said. \"We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"\n\nGetty Images Students protested against Israel's attacks in Gaza across several universities last year, including at Georgetown in Washington DC",

Following the submission of these reports, subsequent actions could be seen, such as travel bans or restrictions, changes to eligibility for certain employment-based visa categories, or heightened scrutiny at U.S. consulates and ports of entry.\n\nDHS has reviewed and made important changes to temporary protected status (TPS) designations for Venezuela and Haiti. As country conditions and U.S. national interest are reviewed, more changes to existing TPS programs may follow.\n\nDHS has rescinded existing and long-standing policy related to prohibiting Immigration enforcement actions in sensitive locations.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025\n\nExecutive Order 14159: \u2018Protecting the American People Against Invasion\u2019\n\nExecutive Order (EO) 14159, titled, \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion,\u201d focuses on efforts to address the illegal entry and unlawful presence of foreign nationals inside the United States. The order authorizes the establishment of the Homeland Security Taskforces (HSTF). The HSTF is charged with addressing a broad spectrum of issues, including criminal cartels, foreign gangs and transnational criminal organizations, and cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks, with a particular focus on offenses involving children. The HSTF is charged with ensuring the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States.\n\nThis order also authorizes the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to limit humanitarian parole and to evaluate existing temporary protected status (TPS) programs to determine whether TPS designations for foreign nationals remain necessary to fulfill the intended purpose. The order also directs DHS to announce and ensure that all previously unregistered noncitizens who meet certain criteria to register their status and to provide law enforcement with the information necessary to fulfill immigration status verification.\n\nSince the issuance of EO 14159, there have been several immigration-related waterfall actions from DHS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include:\n\nOn February 5, 2025, DHS formally ended the 2023 Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Venezuela. TPS and its related benefits, including work authorization, will end on April 7, 2025, for Venezuelans under the 2023 designation. Importantly, the employment authorization documents (EADs) issued under this designation will expire April 2, 2025. Venezuela has two TPS designations: one from 2021 and a second from 2023. Immigration and work authorization benefits for persons from the 2021 designation will end on September 10, 2025. The DHS must decide by July 12, 2025, whether to extend or end the 2021 designation.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, DHS partially vacated the 2024 TPS designation for Haiti. TPS for Haiti was previously extended for eighteen months, through February 3, 2026, under the Biden administration. The February 20, 2025, DHS action now limits the TPS designation for Haiti to twelve months. TPS and its related benefits, including work authorization, will end on August 3, 2025, for individuals under the Haiti designation. TPS holders under this designation may already EAD cards with a validity date of February 3, 2026. The DHS directs employers to update their records to note that the validity of the EAD is valid through August 3, 2025.\n\nOn February 25, 2025, USCIS issued guidance that all foreign nationals fourteen years of age or older who were not fingerprinted or registered when applying for a U.S. visa and who remain in the United States for thirty days or longer, must comply with registration and fingerprinting requirements. The guidance directs those who are required to register to create a USCIS online account to prepare for next steps and ensure they are registered. Failure to comply will result in civil fines and potentially criminal misdemeanor charges. DHS plans to announce the process of registration in the coming weeks, but once an individual has been registered, they will be expected to always carry evidence of registration, if eighteen years of age or older.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025\n\nExecutive Order 14160: \u2018Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship\u2019\n\nExecutive Order 14160, \u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\u201d calls for the end of birthright citizenship for certain infants born in the United States. Specifically, the order applies to children born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, where at least one of a child\u2019s parents was not a lawful permanent resident (i.e., green card holder) or a U.S. citizen. The executive order presented a departure from the longstanding interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and more than one hundred years of Supreme Court of the United States precedent that individuals born in the United States are citizens at birth. The executive order was immediately challenged in court as unconstitutional. On February 5, 2025, a federal judge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction of the order while the lawsuit proceeds. The injunction currently remains in place.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025\n\nExecutive Order 14161: \u2018Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats\u2019\n\nThis executive order calls for enhanced screening and vetting of noncitizens. The order calls for a review and assessment of countries of concern to the security of the United States and a review of visa programs for additional security measures or possible entry bans. The order calls for a detailed report to identify specific countries deemed deficient in vetting to warrant suspension of admission of those nationals and increased enforcement action for those nationals in the United States. The report is due to the administration on March 21, 2025. A partial or full travel ban could be ordered for nationals of countries identified as having deficient screening. Foreign nationals are likely to experience increased administrative visa processing and higher levels of scrutiny at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad and ports of entry.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025\n\nPresidential Memorandum: \u2018America First Trade Policy\u2019\n\nThe \u201cAmerica First Trade Policy\u201d memorandum focuses on \u201cestablishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our Nation\u2019s industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and\u2014above all\u2014benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses.\u201d The memorandum calls for a review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and other existing trade agreements, which could lead to potential impacts or changes to treaty-based nonimmigrant work authorizations falling under existing trade agreements, including the TN, H-1B1, and E-3 visas.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025\n\nPresidential Proclamation 10886: \u2018Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States\u2019\n\nProclamation 10886 declares a national emergency at the southern border and directs the U.S. military to assist DHS in securing the border. DHS will submit reports on the conditions of the southern border which may result in redirecting funds, border barrier construction, and increased U.S. military presence at the southern border. The enhanced enforcement at the southern border may cause potential delays and heightened scrutiny for foreign nationals entering the United States from Mexico.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025\n\nExecutive Order 14169: Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid\n\nThis executive order mandated a ninety-day pause on new obligations and disbursements of U.S. foreign development assistance to allow for a comprehensive review of these programs, to ensure that the foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are aligned with U.S. interests. On February 25, 2025, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release millions of dollars of funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and this decision was upheld by the Supreme Court on March 5, 2025. Due to USAID\u2019s collaboration with U.S. embassies in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, the issuance of H-2 visas in those countries could be delayed.\n\nJanuary 20, 2025\n\nDHS Directive Rescinding of \u2018Sensitive Locations\u2019 Policy\n\nOn January 20, 2025, DHS rescinded the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cprotected areas\u201d policy. The \u201cprotected areas\u201d policy previously prohibited immigration enforcement action in sensitive areas such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship. In rescinding this policy, the DHS memo stated that \u201cbright line rules\u201d will not be followed in terms of where immigration enforcement can take place. Instead, DHS may issue new guidance to officers regarding \u201cexercising appropriate enforcement discretion.\u201d As a result, organizations and previously protected sensitive locations may want to consider their protocols in the event of worksite enforcement actions.\n\nJanuary 22, 2025\n\nDHS Directive: COVID-19 Vaccine Waived for AOS Applications\n\nEffective January 22, 2025, USCIS is waiving the COVID-19 vaccination as a required vaccine on green card applicants\u2019 medical exams. The medical exam form, Form I-693, still lists the COVID-19 vaccine. A new form edition may be released to capture this change. The U.S. Department of State for consular processing abroad has not yet changed its vaccine requirements for immigrant visa processing.\n\nJanuary 23, 2025\n\nExecutive Order 14179: \u2018Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\u2019\n\nThe \u201cRemoving Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\u201d executive order directs the review of all policies, directives, regulations, orders, and other actions taken pursuant to President Joe Biden\u2019s Executive Order 14110 regarding the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) (issued on October 30, 2023; revoked on January 20, 2025). Executive Order 14110 included provisions to streamline the processing of visa petitions for noncitizens working in AI or other critical and emerging technologies. EO 14179 requests an action plan to enhance America\u2019s \u201cglobal AI dominance.\u201d The directives in this order may result in changes to USCIS policy for employees working in AI and applying for O-1, EB-1, or EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) classifications and USCIS policy as it relates to entrepreneur parole.\n\nFebruary 12, 2025\n\nExecutive Order 14211: One Voice for America\u2019s Foreign Relations\n\nExecutive Order 14211 reasserts the secretary of state\u2019s authority over foreign services, including personnel-related areas, implementation of policy, and revision of the Foreign Affairs Manual and any other procedural documents that guide the operations of the foreign service. The order directs the secretary of state to identify necessary reforms for the implementation of the President\u2019s agenda. As a result, visa processing may be affected by the potential changes to personnel procedures of the foreign services, as well as any changes to the Foreign Affairs Manual, which currently serves as the primary authority for procedures and guidance on consular and visa processing.\n\nFebruary 18, 2025\n\nState Department Update: Interview Waiver Eligibility\n\nOn February 18, 2025, the State Department updated the eligibility criteria for the interview waiver program to applicants who are seeking a visa renewal at a U.S. embassy or consulate outside of the United States. Under the updated criteria, interview waiver is now only available for persons seeking a visa renewal in the same category and only if the most recent visa expired less than twelve months (previously forty-eight months) preceding the new application. The updated criteria also removes interview waiver eligibility for first time H-2 visa applicants; but extends eligibility to applicants applying for an A-1, A-2, C-3 (except attendants, servants, or personal employees of accredited officials), G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, NATO-1 through NATO-6, or E-1 visas; and applicants for diplomatic or official type visas. This change to interview waiver eligibility will potentially increase visa application wait times worldwide, as many more applicants will be required to attend in-person interviews.\n\nAnticipated Changes on the Horizon\n\nThe detailed report summarizing potential security risks and areas of deficient vetting mandated by EO 14161, \u201cProtecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,\u201d is due to the administration on March 21, 2025. Additional further travel restrictions or bans may follow the review of this report.\n\nThe \u201cAmerica First Trade Policy\u201d executive order could result in changes or limitations to treaty-based visa options, including the TN, H-1B1, and E visas.\n\nThe \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion\u201d executive order may lead to rollbacks or ending additional TPS country designations.\n\nGiven recent changes to the State Department drop box and interview waiver policy, it is likely that there will be increased wait times and scrutiny for visa processing at U.S. consulates abroad.\n\nIncreased enforcement actions are likely given the administration\u2019s objectives and recent policy shifts. Employers may want to consider their preparedness for increased worksite enforcement actions.\n\nOgletree Deakins\u2019 Immigration Practice Group will continue to monitor developments and will publish updates on the Immigration blog as additional information becomes available.\n\nThis article and more information on how the Trump administration\u2019s actions impact employers can be found on Ogletree Deakins\u2019 New Administration Resource Hub.\n\nFollow and Subscribe\n\nLinkedIn | Instagram | Webinars | Podcasts",

Federal authorities say she was deported due to her attendance at a funeral for a Hezbollah leader and photos on her phone and social media linked to the U.S.-designated terrorist organization.\n\nHer attorneys say the government acted unfairly and are fighting to bring her back.\n\n\"Our client is in Lebanon, and we're not going to stop fighting to get her back in the U.S. to see her patients,\" said Stephanie Marzouk, Alawieh\u2019s attorney. \"We\u2019re also going to make sure that the government follows the rule of law.\"\n\nDeborah Gonzalez, director of the Immigration Law Clinic at Roger Williams University School of Law, says Alawieh\u2019s case is a stark reminder of the risks visa holders face when traveling internationally.\n\n\"My advice is don\u2019t travel, because you\u2019re not guaranteed to come back in,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nShe explained that even though Alawieh had been living and working in the U.S. for six years, she was still a Lebanese citizen. Upon arrival at Logan Airport, she was technically at the border and had no constitutional rights until formally admitted.\n\n\"The Constitution does not attach at the airport because the airport is considered a border,\" Gonzalez said. \"People might be saying, \u2018Well, what about due process?\u2019 There is no due process.

            "content": "There was no explanation, no warning. One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the US. The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before being sent to an Ice detention center without the chance to talk to a lawyer.\n\nI grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in the northernmost part of Canada. I always knew I wanted to do something bigger with my life. I left home early and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where I built a career spanning multiple industries \u2013 acting in film and television, owning bars and restaurants, flipping condos and managing Airbnbs.\n\nIn my 30s, I found my true passion working in the health and wellness industry. I was given the opportunity to help launch an American brand of health tonics called Holy! Water \u2013 a job that would involve moving to the US.\n\nI was granted my trade Nafta work visa, which allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the US in specific professional occupations, on my second attempt. It goes without saying, then, that I have no criminal record. I also love the US and consider myself to be a kind, hard-working person.\n\nI started working in California and travelled back and forth between Canada and the US multiple times without any complications \u2013 until one day, upon returning to the US, a border officer questioned me about my initial visa denial and subsequent visa approval. He asked why I had gone to the San Diego border the second time to apply. I explained that that was where my lawyer\u2019s offices were, and that he had wanted to accompany me to ensure there were no issues.\n\nAfter a long interrogation, the officer told me it seemed \u201cshady\u201d and that my visa hadn\u2019t been properly processed. He claimed I also couldn\u2019t work for a company in the US that made use of hemp \u2013 one of the beverage ingredients. He revoked my visa, and told me I could still work for the company from Canada, but if I wanted to return to the US, I would need to reapply.\n\nI was devastated; I had just started building a life in California. I stayed in Canada for the next few months, and was eventually offered a similar position with a different health and wellness brand.\n\nI restarted the visa process and returned to the same immigration office at the San Diego border, since they had processed my visa before and I was familiar with it. Hours passed, with many confused opinions about my case. The officer I spoke to was kind but told me that, due to my previous issues, I needed to apply for my visa through the consulate. I told her I hadn\u2019t been aware I needed to apply that way, but had no problem doing it.\n\nThen she said something strange: \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You are not in trouble, you are not a criminal.\u201d\n\nI remember thinking: Why would she say that? Of course I\u2019m not a criminal!\n\nShe then told me they had to send me back to Canada. That didn\u2019t concern me; I assumed I would simply book a flight home. But as I sat searching for flights, a man approached me.\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was no explanation, no warning. He led me to a room, took my belongings from my hands and ordered me to put my hands against the wall. A woman immediately began patting me down. The commands came rapid-fire, one after another, too fast to process.\n\nThey took my shoes and pulled out my shoelaces.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? What is happening?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou are being detained.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What does that mean? For how long?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThat would be the response to nearly every question I would ask over the next two weeks: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThey brought me downstairs for a series of interviews and medical questions, searched my bags and told me I had to get rid of half my belongings because I couldn\u2019t take everything with me.\n\n\u201cTake everything with me where?\u201d I asked.\n\nA woman asked me for the name of someone they could contact on my behalf. In moments like this, you realize you don\u2019t actually know anyone\u2019s phone number anymore. By some miracle, I had recently memorized my best friend Britt\u2019s number because I had been putting my grocery points on her account.\n\nI gave them her phone number.\n\nThey handed me a mat and a folded-up sheet of aluminum foil.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour blanket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nI was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.\n\nView image in fullscreen A border patrol agent watches as girls from Central America sleep under thermal blankets at a detention facility in McAllen, Texas, on 8 September 2014. Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images\n\nFor two days, we remained in that cell, only leaving briefly for food. The lights never turned off, we never knew what time it was and no one answered our questions. No one in the cell spoke English, so I either tried to sleep or meditate to keep from having a breakdown. I didn\u2019t trust the food, so I fasted, assuming I wouldn\u2019t be there long.\n\nOn the third day, I was finally allowed to make a phone call. I called Britt and told her that I didn\u2019t understand what was happening, that no one would tell me when I was going home, and that she was my only contact.\n\nThey gave me a stack of paperwork to sign and told me I was being given a five-year ban unless I applied for re-entry through the consulate. The officer also said it didn\u2019t matter whether I signed the papers or not; it was happening regardless.\n\nI was so delirious that I just signed. I told them I would pay for my flight home and asked when I could leave.\n\nNo answer.\n\nThen they moved me to another cell \u2013 this time with no mat or blanket. I sat on the freezing cement floor for hours. That\u2019s when I realized they were processing me into real jail: the Otay Mesa Detention Center.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Otay Mesa Detention Center in Otay Mesa, California, on 9 May 2020. Photograph: Sandy Huffaker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nI was told to shower, given a jail uniform, fingerprinted and interviewed. I begged for information.\n\n\u201cHow long will I be here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know your case,\u201d the man said. \u201cCould be days. Could be weeks. But I\u2019m telling you right now \u2013 you need to mentally prepare yourself for months.\u201d\n\nMonths.\n\nI felt like I was going to throw up.\n\nI was taken to the nurse\u2019s office for a medical check. She asked what had happened to me. She had never seen a Canadian there before. When I told her my story, she grabbed my hand and said: \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d\n\nI told her I had only recently found God, but that I now believed in God more than anything.\n\n\u201cI believe God brought you here for a reason,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it feels like your life is in a million pieces, but you will be OK. Through this, I think you are going to find a way to help others.\u201d\n\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what that meant. She asked if she could pray for me. I held her hands and wept.\n\nI felt like I had been sent an angel.\n\nI was then placed in a real jail unit: two levels of cells surrounding a common area, just like in the movies. I was put in a tiny cell alone with a bunk bed and a toilet.\n\nThe best part: there were blankets. After three days without one, I wrapped myself in mine and finally felt some comfort.\n\nFor the first day, I didn\u2019t leave my cell. I continued fasting, terrified that the food might make me sick. The only available water came from the tap attached to the toilet in our cells or a sink in the common area, neither of which felt safe to drink.\n\nEventually, I forced myself to step out, meet the guards and learn the rules. One of them told me: \u201cNo fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lover, not a fighter,\u201d I joked. He laughed.\n\nI asked if there had ever been a fight here.\n\n\u201cIn this unit? No,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one in this unit has a criminal record.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I started meeting the other women.\n\nThat\u2019s when I started hearing their stories.\n\nView image in fullscreen Women sit on their beds in a privately run 1,000-bed detention center on 28 February 2006 in Otay Mesa, California. Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I made a decision: I would never allow myself to feel sorry for my situation again. No matter how hard this was, I had to be grateful. Because every woman I met was in an even more difficult position than mine.\n\nThere were around 140 of us in our unit. Many women had lived and worked in the US legally for years but had overstayed their visas \u2013 often after reapplying and being denied. They had all been detained without warning.\n\nIf someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets. But not one of these women had a criminal record. These women acknowledged that they shouldn\u2019t have overstayed and took responsibility for their actions. But their frustration wasn\u2019t about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.\n\nThe real issue was how long it took to get out of the system, with no clear answers, no timeline and no way to move forward. Once deported, many have no choice but to abandon everything they own because the cost of shipping their belongings back is too high.\n\nI met a woman who had been on a road trip with her husband. She said they had 10-year work visas. While driving near the San Diego border, they mistakenly got into a lane leading to Mexico. They stopped and told the agent they didn\u2019t have their passports on them, expecting to be redirected. Instead, they were detained. They are both pastors.\n\nI met a family of three who had been living in the US for 11 years with work authorizations. They paid taxes and were waiting for their green cards. Every year, the mother had to undergo a background check, but this time, she was told to bring her whole family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody and told their status would now be processed from within the detention center.\n\nAnother woman from Canada had been living in the US with her husband who was detained after a traffic stop. She admitted she had overstayed her visa and accepted that she would be deported. But she had been stuck in the system for almost six weeks because she hadn\u2019t had her passport. Who runs casual errands with their passport?\n\nOne woman had a 10-year visa. When it expired, she moved back to her home country, Venezuela. She admitted she had overstayed by one month before leaving. Later, she returned for a vacation and entered the US without issue. But when she took a domestic flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she was picked up by Ice and detained. She couldn\u2019t be deported because Venezuela wasn\u2019t accepting deportees. She didn\u2019t know when she was getting out.\n\nThere was a girl from India who had overstayed her student visa for three days before heading back home. She then came back to the US on a new, valid visa to finish her master\u2019s degree and was handed over to Ice due to the three days she had overstayed on her previous visa.\n\nThere were women who had been picked up off the street, from outside their workplaces, from their homes. All of these women told me that they had been detained for time spans ranging from a few weeks to 10 months. One woman\u2019s daughter was outside the detention center protesting for her release.\n\nThat night, the pastor invited me to a service she was holding. A girl who spoke English translated for me as the women took turns sharing their prayers \u2013 prayers for their sick parents, for the children they hadn\u2019t seen in weeks, for the loved ones they had been torn away from.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, they asked if they could pray for me. I was new here, and they wanted to welcome me. They formed a circle around me, took my hands and prayed. I had never felt so much love, energy and compassion from a group of strangers in my life. Everyone was crying.\n\nAt 3am the next day, I was woken up in my cell.\n\n\u201cPack your bag. You\u2019re leaving.\u201d\n\nI jolted upright. \u201cI get to go home?\u201d\n\nThe officer shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nOf course. No one ever knew anything.\n\nI grabbed my things and went downstairs, where 10 other women stood in silence, tears streaming down their faces. But these weren\u2019t happy tears. That was the moment I learned the term \u201ctransferred\u201d.\n\nFor many of these women, detention centers had become a twisted version of home. They had formed bonds, established routines and found slivers of comfort in the friendships they had built. Now, without warning, they were being torn apart and sent somewhere new. Watching them say goodbye, clinging to each other, was gut-wrenching.\n\nI had no idea what was waiting for me next. In hindsight, that was probably for the best.\n\nOur next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together \u2013 women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle.\n\nWhen we arrived at our next destination, we were forced to go through the entire intake process all over again, with medical exams, fingerprinting \u2013 and pregnancy tests; they lined us up in a filthy cell, squatting over a communal toilet, holding Dixie cups of urine while the nurse dropped pregnancy tests in each of our cups. It was disgusting.\n\nWe sat in freezing-cold jail cells for hours, waiting for everyone to be processed. Across the room, one of the women suddenly spotted her husband. They had both been detained and were now seeing each other for the first time in weeks.\n\nThe look on her face \u2013 pure love, relief and longing \u2013 was something I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nWe were beyond exhausted. I felt like I was hallucinating.\n\nThe guard tossed us each a blanket: \u201cFind a bed.\u201d\n\nThere were no pillows. The room was ice cold, and one blanket wasn\u2019t enough. Around me, women lay curled into themselves, heads covered, looking like a room full of corpses. This place made the last jail feel like the Four Seasons.\n\nI kept telling myself: Do not let this break you.\n\nThirty of us shared one room. We were given one Styrofoam cup for water and one plastic spoon that we had to reuse for every meal. I eventually had to start trying to eat and, sure enough, I got sick. None of the uniforms fit, and everyone had men\u2019s shoes on. The towels they gave us to shower were hand towels. They wouldn\u2019t give us more blankets. The fluorescent lights shined on us 24/7.\n\nEverything felt like it was meant to break you. Nothing was explained to us. I wasn\u2019t given a phone call. We were locked in a room, no daylight, with no idea when we would get out.\n\nI tried to stay calm as every fiber of my being raged towards panic mode. I didn\u2019t know how I would tell Britt where I was. Then, as if sent from God, one of the women showed me a tablet attached to the wall where I could send emails. I only remembered my CEO\u2019s email from memory. I typed out a message, praying he would see it.\n\nHe responded.\n\nThrough him, I was able to connect with Britt. She told me that they were working around the clock trying to get me out. But no one had any answers; the system made it next to impossible. I told her about the conditions in this new place, and that was when we decided to go to the media.\n\nShe started working with a reporter and asked whether I would be able to call her so she could loop him in. The international phone account that Britt had previously tried to set up for me wasn\u2019t working, so one of the other women offered to let me use her phone account to make the call.\n\nWe were all in this together.\n\nWith nothing to do in my cell but talk, I made new friends \u2013 women who had risked everything for the chance at a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nThrough them, I learned the harsh reality of seeking asylum. Showing me their physical scars, they explained how they had paid smugglers anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 to reach the US border, enduring brutal jungles and horrendous conditions.\n\nOne woman had been offered asylum in Mexico within two weeks but had been encouraged to keep going to the US. Now, she was stuck, living in a nightmare, separated from her young children for months. She sobbed, telling me how she felt like the worst mother in the world.\n\nMany of these women were highly educated and spoke multiple languages. Yet, they had been advised to pretend they didn\u2019t speak English because it would supposedly increase their chances of asylum.\n\nSome believed they were being used as examples, as warnings to others not to try to come.\n\nWomen were starting to panic in this new facility, and knowing I was most likely the first person to get out, they wrote letters and messages for me to send to their families.\n\nSome of the letters given to Jasmine Mooney from the women she met during her time in Ice detention facilities. Photograph: Jasmine Mooney\n\nIt felt like we had all been kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.\n\nWe were from different countries, spoke different languages and practiced different religions. Yet, in this place, none of that mattered. Everyone took care of each other. Everyone shared food. Everyone held each other when someone broke down. Everyone fought to keep each other\u2019s hope alive.\n\nI got a message from Britt. My story had started to blow up in the media.\n\nAlmost immediately after, I was told I was being released.\n\nMy Ice agent, who had never spoken to me, told my lawyer I could have left sooner if I had signed a withdrawal form, and that they hadn\u2019t known I would pay for my own flight home.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I begged every officer I saw to let me pay for my own ticket home. Not a single one of them ever spoke to me about my case.\n\nTo put things into perspective: I had a Canadian passport, lawyers, resources, media attention, friends, family and even politicians advocating for me. Yet, I was still detained for nearly two weeks.\n\nImagine what this system is like for every other person in there.\n\nA small group of us were transferred back to San Diego at 2am \u2013 one last road trip, once again shackled in chains. I was then taken to the airport, where two officers were waiting for me. The media was there, so the officers snuck me in through a side door, trying to avoid anyone seeing me in restraints. I was beyond grateful that, at the very least, I didn\u2019t have to walk through the airport in chains.\n\nTo my surprise, the officers escorting me were incredibly kind, and even funny. It was the first time I had laughed in weeks.\n\nI asked if I could put my shoelaces back on.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d one of them said with a grin. \u201cBut you better not run.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the other added. \u201cOr we\u2019ll have to tackle you in the airport. That\u2019ll really make the headlines.\u201d\n\nI laughed, then told them I had spent a lot of time observing the guards during my detention and I couldn\u2019t believe how often I saw humans treating other humans with such disregard. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d I joked. \u201cYou two get five stars.\u201d\n\nWhen I finally landed in Canada, my mom and two best friends were waiting for me. So was the media. I spoke to them briefly, numb and delusional from exhaustion.\n\nIt was surreal listening to my friends recount everything they had done to get me out: working with lawyers, reaching out to the media, making endless calls to detention centers, desperately trying to get through to Ice or anyone who could help. They said the entire system felt rigged, designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to get out.\n\nThe reality became clear: Ice detention isn\u2019t just a bureaucratic nightmare. It\u2019s a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.\n\nCompanies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive government funding based on the number of people they detain, which is why they lobby for stricter immigration policies. It\u2019s a lucrative business: CoreCivic made over $560m from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than $763m from Ice contracts.\n\nThe more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly. What I had experienced was finally starting to make sense.\n\nThis is not just my story. It is the story of thousands and thousands of people still trapped in a system that profits from their suffering. I am writing in the hope that someone out there \u2013 someone with the power to change any of this \u2013 can help do something.\n\nThe strength I witnessed in those women, the love they gave despite their suffering, is what gives me faith. Faith that no matter how flawed the system, how cruel the circumstances, humanity will always shine through.\n\nEven in the darkest places, within the most broken systems, humanity persists. Sometimes, it reveals itself in the smallest, most unexpected acts of kindness: a shared meal, a whispered prayer, a hand reaching out in the dark. We are defined by the love we extend, the courage we summon and the truths we are willing to tell.",

            "content": "On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security released documents related to Prince Harry\u2019s immigration status and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s quest to make his visa-application records public under the Freedom of Information Act. The documents contain private declarations from three DHS officers who had reviewed Harry\u2019s records, as well as the transcript of a hearing with Judge Carl Nichols about the matter. However, they redact all details about the Duke of Sussex\u2019s immigration status and the type of visa he has, with one of the DHS officials stating there was no evidence that Harry received special treatment from the government.\n\nA source close to the duke says the documents show he was properly admitted to the US. \u201cAllegations that Prince Harry received preferential treatment during his US immigration process were unequivocally dismissed today by the Trump administration,\u201d the source tells Vanity Fair. \u201cFurthermore, the redactions in the case further weaken the Heritage Foundation\u2019s claim that the duke\u2019s immigration records should be considered a matter of public interest.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind the controversial Project 2025 plans that have helped guide President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, started its quest to acquire Harry\u2019s immigration information in 2023, soon after the publication of his best-selling memoir, Spare. Their early filings in the case claim that Harry admitted to \u201ca long history\u201d of drug use in the memoir, alleging that this raised questions about whether the royal was properly vetted when he moved to the US in 2020 along with his wife, Meghan Markle.\n\nNile Gardiner, director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told GB News that he was not surprised that Harry\u2019s full application was not released. \u201cWe still do not know whether or not Prince Harry lied on his application,\u201d Gardiner added. \u201cThe fight continues to release Prince Harry\u2019s immigration application to the American people.\u201d\n\nIn a heavily redacted declaration from April 2024 released on Tuesday, Jarrod Panter, a DHS official in the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Unit, told the court that Heritage\u2019s arguments about \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d were baseless, adding that \u201capplicable rules and regulations\u201d were followed when Harry was admitted to the US. \u201cThis speculation by Plaintiffs does not point to any evidence of government misconduct. The records, as explained above, do not support such an allegation but show the regulatory process involved in reviewing and granting immigration benefits, which was done in compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d\n\nThe case was originally dismissed last fall, following DHS\u2019s decision that none of the records could be made public without compromising Harry\u2019s right to privacy. The foundation later appealed the decision, arguing that certain aspects of DHS\u2019s private decision-making should be released. In a February hearing, the first in the case since Donald Trump\u2019s reelection, Judge Nichols indicated that some documents could be made public provided that they didn\u2019t violate Harry\u2019s privacy rights.\n\nAccording to a transcript of an April 30, 2024, hearing that took place in front of Nichols, DHS attorneys John Bardo and Peter Pfaffenroth noted that part of Harry\u2019s immigration records were in the possession of the State Department. \u201cWe would have to research whether the court is able to get another agency that\u2019s not involved in this case into this case, and we would likely need to take it up the chain through various people at State and at Justice,\u201d Bardo said. \u201cBut this case is really about whether the Heritage Foundation is entitled to these records.\u201d\n\nIn February, Trump told the New York Post that he had no plans to deport Harry from American soil, despite the Heritage Foundation\u2019s efforts. Still, the invocation of the State Department might set the conservative think tank on another route by which they can continue to pursue Harry\u2019s private immigration records. In recent weeks, the Trump White House has begun to invoke the secretary of state\u2019s rarely used powers to deport a noncitizen if they deem the person\u2019s presence in the US might cause \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday interview with CBS, State Secretary Marco Rubio said that he plans to continue using that power to target pro-Palestine protesters for deportation, following the arrest of Columbia graduate student and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people in our country that are gonna be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201d",

            "content": "Several Chinese students slammed legislation that was introduced last week by Republican lawmakers that seeks to keep them out of American schools.\n\nThe bill, the Stop CCP VISAs Act, would halt the issuance of student visas to Chinese nationals looking to study at U.S. universities or take part in exchange programs.\n\nThe bill cites national security concerns, saying that those on student visas have in the past attempted to spy for the Chinese Communist Party. But the Chinese nationals who spoke to NBC News said that they came to the U.S. looking for more academic freedom, calling the legislation \u201cthe new Chinese Exclusion Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just blatant racism and xenophobia,\u201d said one Chinese student who recently graduated from a D.C.-area university and requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. \u201cWe are not spies. We are students who want to get a better education.\u201d\n\nRep. Riley Moore, R.W.Va., who introduced the bill, doubled down on the legislation amid criticisms from students and advocacy groups.\n\n\u201cI will never apologize for defending America\u2019s vital national interests against our greatest geopolitical foe,\u201d he said in an email to NBC News.\n\nWith the widespread backlash, it\u2019s unlikely the bill will pass. However, students say it\u2019s added to their concerns around safety in the U.S.\n\nChinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that the U.S. has long \u201csuppressed and persecuted\u201d Chinese students in the U.S. who have legal and valid documents and visas and that China \u201cfirmly opposes\u201d such practices.\n\n\u201cThe hope of China-U.S. relations lies in the people, its foundation is in people-to-people exchanges, and its future in the youth.\u201d\n\nFive House Republicans are co-sponsoring the bill, and Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla., is set to introduce companion legislation in the Senate. In one case cited by Moore, five Chinese students at the University of Michigan were confronted near a military site during a late-night visit in 2023. It wasn\u2019t revealed to be a national security issue, and they were charged with lying to investigators about the trip and conspiring to delete photos from their cellphones.\n\nA Princeton University Ph.D. student, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said he was shocked by the \u201cextreme\u201d nature of the bill, saying it painted Chinese students with a broad brush.\n\n\u201cI graduated from a top college in China so I did have access to a lot of great resources in research, but because of the censorship, there were so many topics you couldn\u2019t study,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that while the university environment has been inclusive and inviting, he\u2019s felt a slight shift under the new Trump administration, with schools a bit more reluctant to speak out for their international students. And this new bill certainly isn\u2019t helping, he said, adding that if he begins to feel unsafe, he would consider moving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met so many talented Chinese students, and they\u2019re contributing to the U.S. through the economy, their technology, much more than I think they realize,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be such a shame to drive them away.\u201d\n\nMichael Hotchkiss, Princeton\u2019s assistant vice president of communications, said that the school\u2019s Davis International Center helps provide guidance and information for its international students, each working with an adviser.\n\n\u201cPrinceton supports and advocates for its international students,\u201d Hotchkiss said in a statement.\n\nA Yale Law school student, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said the bill itself perpetuates a harmful, unfair image of Chinese students as spies. For him, it was the legal environment in the U.S. that attracted him to schools in the country in the first place.\n\n\u201cI studied law in China before, and I felt like the Chinese legal system and the rule of law is, in many aspects, still very compromised,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far the bill has received extensive backlash from Asian American organizations, including the Asian American Scholar Forum, who said that many international scholars come from countries with political turmoil, limited rights or constrained opportunities. The legislation would harm the talent pipeline of scholars, the organization said, and in turn hurt U.S. leadership in science and innovation.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to cut off this pipeline of talent and exclude such an integral part of our American community,\u201d said Gisela Kusakawa, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cTo do so would be to turn our backs on the very ideals that have made America a global leader in innovation and discovery.\u201d",

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nThere has been much hype around the anticipated release of documents relating to Prince Harry\u2019s VISA application this week. However, as files were made public yesterday evening, it quickly became clear that they would not provide any answers to questions raised about what he said about drug use on his U.S. immigration form.\n\nCourt documents were released yesterday consisting almost entirely of huge sections of blacked out text. The details that are visible largely only serve to outline why so much has been redacted. \u201cTo release his exact status could subject him to reasonably foreseeable harm in the form of harassment as well as unwanted contact by the media and others,\u201d the documents read.\n\nThe files are not Harry\u2019s visa application itself but documents relating to a freedom of information request to make public details of what was put on his visa application. Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation began pursuing the question in 2023 of what Harry said on his immigration application about previous drug use and how his case was handled by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cA key factor here has been Prince Harry\u2019s memoir and his revelations about his own drug use. He\u2019s put it all out there,\u201d the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Nile Gardiner previously told journalists . \u201cLet\u2019s see whether that exactly matches what he put on his immigration application.\u201d\n\nIn , the Prince wrote about taking marijuana and cocaine in the UK as well as magic mushrooms in Los Angeles in 2016. Admission of drug use on an immigration form can lead to an application being rejected, although this is not necessarily always the case.\n\nIt is not known what kind of visa Harry was granted to stay in the U.S. or what he said on his application. The release of these latest documents have not answered either of these questions. Instead, the documents have made it clear that this information has been \u201cwithheld in full\u201d as to release it would be in violation of Harry\u2019s right to privacy and there was not a discernible public interest in doing so. The documents also refute suggestions that the Prince received preferential treatment over his application.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s Nile Gardener reacted to the released documents X. \u201cThere is zero accountability and transparency in the heavily redacted documents released today,\u201d he wrote.",

The \"orange\" tier, potentially affecting countries like Belarus, Russia, and Pakistan, would impose significant visa limitations, though exemptions for wealthy business travelers are under consideration. Finally, the \"yellow\" group, which includes Cambodia and Zimbabwe, would face partial visa suspensions unless specific security deficiencies are addressed within a 60-day timeframe.\n\nThe proposed measures, stemming from a January executive order mandating stricter security vetting, mirror Trump's controversial policies during his first term, which included a highly contested travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim nations that eventually reached and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018. That ban also affected the Iranians already integrated into the American society, as they were unable to travel back home to meet their families.\n\nAmidst reports of the new potential visa bans, the plight of Iranian immigrants deported by the U.S. has resurfaced. Earlier this year, Trump's administration faced scrutiny for its handling of Iranian migrants, many of whom are now enduring harsh conditions in Panama. Under a US-Panama agreement, dozens of Iranians were among nearly 100 migrants moved to a remote detention camp in the Panamanian jungle in February.\n\nThese deported individuals, including children, were initially confined to a locked hotel before being relocated to the Darien province, a region notorious for its difficult environment and prevalent diseases like dengue fever. One of the migrants likened the facility to a \"zoo\" with \"fenced cages\" and inadequate provisions.\n\nThe relationship between Iran and the U.S. is at a critical low point. While analysts argue that regaining the trust of Iranians is essential to resolving the ongoing tensions, Trump's rhetoric, aggressive policies, and past actions actively undermine that goal.\n\n",

            "content": "According to a New York Times report, the travel ban could affect at least 40 countries.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump\u2018s administration is mulling a new travel ban that is expected to affect citizens from dozens of countries to varying degrees, The New York Times reported.\n\nQuoting anonymous officials, the report published on Friday said the US government\u2019s draft list featured 43 countries, divided into three categories of travel restrictions.\n\nThe first group of 10 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Cuba and North Korea, would be set for a full visa suspension.\n\nIn the second group, five countries \u2013 Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar and South Sudan \u2013 would face partial suspensions that would affect tourist and student visas as well as other immigrant visas, with some exceptions.\n\nIn the third group, a total of 26 countries that includes Belarus, Pakistan and Turkmenistan would be considered for a partial suspension of US visa issuance if their governments \u201cdo not make efforts to address deficiencies within 60 days\u201d, the draft memo said.\n\nA US official speaking on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency there could be changes to the list and it was yet to be approved by the administration, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump issued an executive order on January 20 requiring intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the US to detect national security threats.\n\nThe order directed several cabinet members to submit by March 21 a list of countries from which travel should be partly or fully suspended because their \u201cvetting and screening information is so deficient\u201d.\n\nThe US president\u2019s directive is part of an immigration crackdown he launched at the start of his second term. He previewed his plan in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and \u201canywhere else that threatens our security\u201d.\n\nThe latest travel ban proposal, however, harkens back to Trump\u2019s first-term ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.\n\nThat ban targeted citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and ignited international outrage and domestic court rulings against it. Iraq and Sudan were later dropped from the list, but in 2018 the Supreme Court upheld a later version of the ban for the other nations as well as North Korea and Venezuela.",

A family member learned she would be deported on Friday and contacted her attorneys, according to a petition filed in federal court on her behalf.\n\nReturning from the trip, she was in possession of a valid H-1B visa she recently received from the American consulate in Beirut, the filing said. An H-1B visa allows employers to hire foreign workers for positions that require specialty knowledge.\n\nThe petition claims Alawieh, who also works for Brown Medicine\u2019s Division of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, is being held \u201cwithout any justification\u201d or permission to access legal counsel. The filing attests that the State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service approved her visa, and the reason why she was held by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection remains unclear.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe incident comes amid a nationwide crackdown on immigration by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I are outraged at Dr. Alawieh\u2019s detention and deportation without due process,\u201d George Bayliss, Brown Medicine doctor and associate professor of medicine wrote in an email to The Herald.\n\nAssistant Professor of Medicine Rasha Alawieh.

When offered the assistant professorship at Brown, she petitioned and was approved for an H-1B visa, sponsored by Brown Medicine, the filing said.\n\n\u201cHer colleagues have been covering for her, but that is no solution. Dr. Alawieh is an outstanding academic in Transplant Nephrology, and she is needed at Brown Medicine,\u201d the action reads.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin ordered Friday that Alawieh not be moved outside of Massachusetts without providing the court 48 hours\u2019 notice of the move and the reasoning behind it.\n\nImmigration officials did not receive this order before Alawieh was sent on a plane to Paris, according to the Boston Globe. The Herald was unable to independently verify Alawieh\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nBrown Spokesperson Brian Clark said the University is trying to seek more information about the situation. \u201cWe need to be careful about sharing information publicly about an individual\u2019s personal circumstances,\u201d he wrote in an email to The Herald.\n\nThis is a developing story.

This policy directly impacts those who have facilitated such returns, where individuals often face severe human rights abuses, including torture and disappearances.\n\nAs an immediate measure, Secretary Rubio has imposed visa restrictions on current and former officials from the Government of Thailand involved in the forced return of 40 Uyghurs from Thailand on February 27. This action sends a stern warning to governments worldwide that complicity in the persecution of Uyghurs will not be tolerated.\n\nImam Abdul Malik Mujahid, President of Justice For All, applauded this significant move: \u201cThe State Department\u2019s decision underlines a commitment to uphold human rights and protect the oppressed. By specifically targeting those complicit in these deportations, the U.S. is championing a necessary ethic of accountability. We urge all countries to consider their roles and responsibilities in preventing such human rights violations.\u201d\n\nArslan Hidayat, Team Lead of the Save Uyghur Campaign, emphasized the policy\u2019s broader implications: \u201cThis is a step toward justice for Uyghurs and other at-risk groups. Secretary Rubio\u2019s actions not only challenge those aiding China\u2019s egregious policies but also encourage global reflection and action. Other nations will now think twice, as was seen recently when a Turkish court decided to deport two Uyghur refugees to China. Such actions must not be repeated.\u201d\n\nJustice For All calls on the global community to follow this lead and enhance efforts to safeguard persecuted individuals. Uyghurs, in particular, are in urgent need of asylum and protection from unjust deportations and subsequent mistreatment.",

I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,\u201d he added.\n\nElon Musk is seen in the U.S. Capitol after a meeting with Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), while on the Hill to talk about President-elect Donald Trump's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Musk recently voiced his support of H-1B visas, a topic that has divided conservatives. Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nProgressives like Sanders have criticized the H-1B program for years, saying it offers tech companies a way to undercut U.S.-born workers by paying below-market rates.\n\nIn a 2020 paper on the system, the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute described it as an important but \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d program for attracting skilled workers, saying it enables U.S. companies to \u201clegally underpay\u201d foreign workers relative to their U.S. counterparts.\n\nAlthough the program is meant to help employers find workers with specialized skills, the authors of that report found the largest employers used it \u201cto fill a very large number of routine positions that require relatively little experience and ordinary skills.\u201d\n\nSanders criticized Tesla\u2019s reliance on the program, pointing out that the car manufacturer slashed some of its U.S. workforce last year.\n\n\u201cIf there really is a shortage of skilled tech workers in America, then why did Tesla lay-off over 7,500 American workers \u2026 while being approved to employ thousands of H-1B guest workers?\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nRelated...",

            "content": "The Trump administration is considering sweeping travel restrictions that could fully suspend visa issuance for citizens of ten countries, including Iran, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.\n\nIran is among the countries facing the strictest new US travel restrictions, alongside Afghanistan, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea, Reuters reported on Friday. If implemented, the policy would fully suspend visa issuance for Iranians, effectively cutting off legal entry into the United States and further tightening Trump\u2019s already restrictive immigration policies.\n\nThis move comes as Iranian migrants deported by the US struggle in dire conditions in Panama. Dozens of Iranians were among nearly 100 migrants transferred to a detention camp deep in the Panamanian jungle in February under an agreement between the US and Panama.\n\nDeported migrants, including children, were initially held in a locked hotel before being moved to the Dari\u00e9n province\u2014an area notorious for its harsh environment and prevalence of diseases like dengue. One Iranian migrant, Artemis Ghasemzadeh, described the facility as resembling a \u201czoo\u201d with \u201cfenced cages\u201d and inadequate food.\n\nThe Panamanian government, under pressure from the US, insists the site is a temporary migrant center. However, reports indicate that some detainees, fearing persecution if repatriated, remain in limbo. Iranian Christians, in particular, face potential death sentences under Iranian law for converting from Islam.\n\nFacing mounting criticism, Panama recently announced that it will issue temporary 90-day permits to some migrants, including those deported from the US. This measure applies to individuals unable or unwilling to return to their home countries due to security concerns. However, for many, these permits offer little clarity on their long-term future.\n\nThe new travel ban proposal echoes Trump\u2019s first-term immigration crackdown, which included a travel ban primarily targeting Muslim-majority nations. That policy went through multiple legal battles before being upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2018.",

Do an independent search and confirm that reputable news outlets, such as NBC and Telemundo, have published it.\n\nIn this case, the official trusted source on visas to travel to Mexico is the National Institute of Migration. On its site, there's a list of countries that do not require visas to travel to Mexico, including the United States.\n\nAlso, the websites of the Mexican consulates in the United States have a section on services for foreigners.\n\nAlthough travelers from the U.S. don't need a visa, what Mexico has always required from foreigners is the multiple migration form, or FMM, which can be obtained on the National Institute of Migration website.\n\nAs always, bring your U.S. passport as well.",

The school is doing everything in their power to do their best to keep students safe, but I think there\u2019s a limit to what they're able to do,\" the student, a junior, said. \"Last night was evidence of that limit.\"\n\nSebastian Javadpoor, 22, said he was \"overcome with rage\" upon the latest search warrants.\n\nJavadpoor, who leads the university's student-led Democratic club, said he and about a dozen other student leaders met with school officials to convey their fears.\n\n\"We have students who are so scared about the possibility of retaliation, about the possibility of having ICE reported on them, that they're too afraid to call public safety if something happens to them,\" he said. \"They're too afraid to call NYPD. They're too afraid to even seek support and services from the administration itself.\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil as part of an effort to revoke his green card and deport him, his lawyers said. Khalil, 30, an Algerian citizen and pro-Palestinian activist, is married to a U.S. citizen and was arrested at his university-owned residential building.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security stated in a document obtained by NBC News.\n\nHe is currently being held at a detention facility in Louisiana, where government officials want him to remain. His lawyers argue that he should be returned to New York and that the administration\u2019s actions violate the First Amendment.\n\nKhalil's removal from campus came days after the Trump administration announced that it would cancel approximately $400 million in federal grants to the university \"due to the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"\n\nThe administration says the school must make sweeping policy changes, including a ban on masks \"intended to conceal identity or intimidate others,\" and allowing for \"full law enforcement authority, including arrest and removal of agitators.\" Columbia has said it would work with the administration to ensure funding continues and is \"committed to combating antisemitism and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff.\"\n\nA DHS spokesperson has said Khalil's arrest was in coordination with ICE and the State Department \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism\" because Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\"\n\nHis arrest was only the latest action to roil the campus after the last school year, when student protesters occupied Hamilton Hall, leading to dozens of arrests for trespassing. While nearly all of the related charges were eventually dropped, the school on Thursday said it has suspended or expelled some of the students who participated and temporarily revoked some diplomas of those who graduated.\n\nOn Friday, dozens of police barricades surrounded the university's main entrance. The university gates that once remained open to all New Yorkers were locked shut as students flashed their badges to get to class, shuffling past police officers, news cameras and flocks of campus security.\n\nSome students participated in a walk out Friday afternoon in response to Khalil's arrest and the student sanctions.\n\nUniversity leaders want to unify the faculty \u2014 and potentially some students \u2014 by focusing discussions on how Columbia can best defend the school's independence in the face of unprecedented pressure from the Trump administration, as it cracks down on certain international students who engaged in pro-Palestinian protests that swept college campuses.\n\nSome faculty members feel that the Trump administration's demand that Columbia changes how the university operates goes too far and involves core prerogatives of the university. They hope to use this moment to spark a discussion of what the university stands for.\n\n\u201cHow do we prevent the university from being divided?\u201d an administrator, who asked not to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly, said about the mood among university faculty and staff. \u201cPeople are more oriented toward what we need to do to defend the university.\u201d\n\nA graduate student from India said she wanted to join student-led protests over Khalil's removal from campus in recent days, but feared doing so also could put her student visa in jeopardy.\n\n\"Your free speech is curtailed. As students, you should be having those kind of rights, but you don\u2019t,\u201d the 29-year-old said. \u201cYou know what\u2019s going on, you do want to speak out, but as an international student, you\u2019re in a tough position, right?\"",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A group of House Republicans on Friday put forward legislation seeking to prevent Chinese students from studying in American schools, as some U.S. lawmakers are targeting China over national security concerns.\n\nRep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., introduced the bill that could bar Chinese nationals from receiving visas that allow foreigners to travel to the U.S. to study or participate in exchange visitor programs. Five other Republicans co-sponsored the measure.\n\nBy granting Chinese nationals such visas, the U.S. has \u201cinvited\u201d the Chinese Communist Party \u201cto spy on our military, steal our intellectual property, and threaten national security,\u201d Moore said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time we turn off the spigot and immediately ban all student visas going to Chinese nationals.\u201d\n\nThe measure is unlikely to pass, and it has drawn criticism from organizations and scholars over concerns that hostile policies and rhetoric toward Chinese students could hurt U.S. interests.\n\n\u201cNo policy should target individuals solely on the basis of their national origin,\u201d Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMaking international students \u2014 the most vetted and tracked nonimmigrants in the United States \u2014 a scapegoat for xenophobic and anti-Chinese sentiment is misguided and antithetical to our national interest,\u201d Aw said.\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said China \u201cexpresses strong concern and firmly opposes such practices.\u201d He said education exchange and cooperation has long served as a pillar for the stable development of China-U.S. relations.\n\nThe Asian American Scholars Forum said such legislation would harm the talent pipeline of Asian American scientists, scholars and researchers, undermining U.S. leadership in science and innovation.\n\nDespite the bill\u2019s slim chance of getting approved, Yangyang Cheng, research scholar at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, said the bill \u201cshould be seen as part of a broader effort to restrict academic freedom and hurt higher education in this country, to control what can be taught, which research projects can be pursued, and who have access to the classrooms and laboratories.\u201d\n\nIn the 2023-24 school year, more than 277,000 Chinese students were studying in U.S. universities, or a quarter of the total number of international students, according to an annual report on international students from the Institute of International Education. The number of Chinese students in the U.S., however, has been declining for years. Last year, China lost its status to India as the top feeder country of international students.\n\nIn 2023, Florida passed a law prohibiting state universities from hiring students from China and six other countries for graduate assistant and postdoc positions., and it\u2019s been challenged in court. Several U.S. universities have ended academic partnerships with Chinese schools amid mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers over national security concerns.\n\nReactions on China\u2019s social media to the new legislation were varied. Some who said they had recently received offers from American schools expressed concerns, some dismissed it as \u201ca political show,\u201d and some called it \u201canother Chinese Exclusion Act.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP writer Didi Tang in Washington contributed to the report.",

And that was just day one at the New Colossus Festival, held last week.\n\nThe six-day event takes its name from the poem cast on the Statue of Liberty, viewed as a welcome message for new immigrants: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses\u2026.\u201d\n\nWatch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE WATCH HERE\n\nAlmost 200 artists were scheduled to perform, more than half from outside the United States. But New Colossus may be an exception, not the rule, for international artists hoping to perform in the U.S. In the last few years, the process has grown much more arduous and expensive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already at the maximum level of difficulty that we can rationalize,\u201d said Mischa Dempsey, frontperson for the thrilling Montreal band Knitting, who performed at New Colossus and described the process as \u201clabor intensive.\u201d\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even think about it getting worse.\u201d\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the USCIS introduced a visa fee increase, raising the cost from $460 to over $1,615 per musician application, the first bump since 2016. According to the USCIS website, the increase allows the organization to \u201crecover our operating costs more fully and support timely processing of new applications.\u201d\n\nNearly a year later, \u201cwe are seeing the opposite,\u201d immigration attorney Gabriel Castro said. \u201cWe are seeing cases actually slow down.\u201d\n\nThe USCIS did not respond to an email from the AP.\n\nVisa processing times slow\n\nChanges to the system have caused delays. According to Tamizdat, a nonprofit that advocates for international artist mobility, all visa petitions are now filed through a centralized service center in Texas and are randomly divvyed up to preexisting California and Vermont service centers.\n\nThe result has been slowed processing times. Matthew Covey, an immigration attorney and Tamizdat's executive director, says Vermont has gone from one month to three. In California, it previously took two to four months, but now, it's eight.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s filing petitions long enough in advance to sustain an eight-month delay,\u201d says Covey. \u201cYou got a 50/50 chance of it being done in a reasonable amount of time or having to pay an extra $2,800 to expedite it.\u201d\n\nCastro says small and mid-tier artists don\u2019t have the luxury of spending nearly $3,000 on expedited processing or booking tour dates eight months in advance. \u201cAnd you have to have those tour dates before you apply for the visa,\" he adds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just more expensive than ever to try and do a tour in the U.S. And that\u2019s a problem,\u201d says Jen Jacobsen, executive director at The Artist Rights Alliance. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t say the fee change by itself has had the impact \u2014 it\u2019s a combination of inefficiencies and delays.\u201d\n\nAre international artists avoiding the U.S.?\n\nThe headlines are frequent: The K-pop group KARD canceled its 2025 U.S. tour due to visa issues. So did the Canadian metal band Respire. The up-and-coming Swedish rapper Bladee delayed his 2024 tour for similar issues. In the film world, Iranian co-directors Hossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani took home an Oscar for their animated short, \u201cIn the Shadow of the Cypress\u201d \u2014 after arriving in Los Angeles just hours before, due to visa delays.\n\nAll international musicians require work authorization to perform in the U.S. There are scarce exemptions available to only a few, like the Visa Waiver Program, which is often used at South by Southwest.\n\n\u201cThe safest approach is always to get a ... visa,\u201d says Castro.\n\nJacobsen says \u201cthere\u2019s definitely a buzz about whether touring in the U.S. is still a good economic option\u201d for these artists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing more and more frequently from artists who are just like, \u2018I\u2019m going to take a break from the U.S. for a while. It\u2019s not a return on my investment. It\u2019s not worth it,\u2019\u201d says Covey.\n\nWho is most affected?\n\nDelays and fee increases disproportionally affect \u201cworld music artists, jazz, indie bands who are developing,\u201d says Covey, as well as \u201cartists outside of Europe who have government support \u2026 if they come in from the Global South, they generally are not going to have a lot of government funding to cover these kinds of costs.\u201d\n\nNew Colossus' lineups have benefited from governments who support local artists. \u201cCountries like Germany, England,Canada, France, Ireland and Wales have funding bodies that the bands apply for,\u201d says Steven Matrick, one of the New Colossus Festival founders. \u201cThey recognize our festival as a showcase festival. And the bands get funded to come here by those bodies.\u201d\n\nBut still, that does not make them immune to last-minute cancellations. This year, artists from Ireland, Scotland and Italy canceled. A band from Paraguay was held up by visa delays; they arrived after their second scheduled performance straight from the airport. Hi\u00e7amahi\u00e7, a band from Istanbul, had to cancel entirely.\n\nIn a statement, Hi\u00e7amahi\u00e7 explained that two band members couldn\u2019t get visa appointments in time, despite working with an intermediary agency. \u201cThe U.S. is currently issuing standard visa interview dates for Turkish citizens nearly 1,000 days later, which feels like an elitist form of discrimination. We are deeply disappointed by this situation,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we are any different from a citizen of the U.K. or Germany.\u201d\n\nMatrick says, \u201cWe have probably 10 cancellations a year, with people that don\u2019t get the funding to purchase visas,\u201d or their visas are not processed in time.\n\nCastro reminds that the loss of international talent stateside is not just a cultural one, but economic. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss for the venues ... the bars, the parking lots,\u201d he lists.\n\nConcerns under a new presidency\n\n\u201cBased on the last Trump administration, what we saw over the course of the four years were increasing problems with consular process,\u201d Covey says. \u201cThe delay times increased. The number of errors increased. Obviously, the scrutiny ... increased.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting that we will probably start seeing increased delays in the visa processing at U.S. embassies,\" he adds. And in a period of global conflict, \u201cyour indie rock band is really not priority.\u201d\n\nCastro said it is early to make predictions \u201cof what this is going to look like in the future ... But that doesn\u2019t mean that changes in immigration, generally, can affect these visas tangentially. The slow-down in immigration processes is a slow down for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the policies about clamping down on illegal immigration sometimes flow into areas \u2014 unintended areas, perhaps \u2014 but areas that can impact legal immigration,\u201d says Jacobsen. \u201cIf we want a rich palette of artistry to be here, we have to make it a welcoming environment for them.\u201d\n\nThere are other potential impacts: At the end of last month, the U.S. government ordered a visa ban on transgender athletes looking to enter the U.S. for sports events. \u201cThey\u2019re just talking about enforcing it on athletes, but it doesn\u2019t take very much to imagine them enforcing that on anyone,\u201d says Covey. \"I\u2019m concerned that the political agendas of the current administration could impact which artists get visas and which don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDempsey, of the band Knitting, said: \u201cThree of us are gender nonconforming and I think more than anything, we're scared of what it\u2019s going to be like in the States, what it\u2019s going to be like to cross the border.\"",

In an interview with CNBC, he stated his expectations about March, April, and May witnessing the rally. Therefore, missing critical trading days can be a mistake for investors.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nLee believes that investors can consider buying as the markets are unsettled. In an interview with CNBC, he went on to explain that the market\u2019s 10 best days last year resulted in the addition of up to 20 percentage points for the broader S&P 500. However, if we exclude these 10 days, the index increased by only 4%. According to him, the best days might be around the corner. If there are tensions related to the growth or related to the employment market, Trump or the US Fed can intervene to bring some stability. These are the favourable catalysts for the upcoming weeks, says Lee.

Hetts believes that there are bright spots in the international markets such as Europe and China, that have surpassed the performance of the US stocks since the beginning of the year. Even though the mega-cap tech stocks have been declining, they are getting cheaper as compared with the elevated valuations just a few months ago.\n\nAccording to experts, there are several signs of economic strength. Gus Faucher, chief economist for PNC Financial Services Group, told Morningstar that consumers continue to spend amidst weakness in the sentiment data. Also, the labor market has been holding up. Overall, the chief economist doesn\u2019t see any sort of fundamental weaknesses in the broader economy that can signal a problem.

Trump has set an ambitious goal to sell 1 million gold cards, which would generate $5 trillion for the government.\n\nApart from the fiscal benefits, during his March 4 address to Congress, Trump also touted the gold card as a way to ensure the U.S. attracts and retains wealthy immigrants despite the administration\u2019s sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nWhile details are sparse ahead of a tentative launch date in March, the information that is available bodes poorly for the gold card\u2019s chances of successful and speedy implementation.\n\nWhat is the precedent for the gold card, and how have similar visa programs fared?\n\nThe gold card was first presented as taking the place of the EB-5 investor visa program, which allocates roughly 10,000 visas\u2014the first step to getting a green card that allows permanent legal residency\u2014each year for individuals who make an $1.05 million investment (with a provision allowing for a lower $800,000 investment in \u201ctargeted employment areas\u201d) that creates or saves 10 American jobs.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who appears to be one of the main architects of the gold card proposal, characterized the EB-5 in his remarks as \u201cfull of nonsense, make believe, and fraud.\u201d Since then, the administration has indicated that while the EB-5 will be restructured, it will remain in place alongside the new gold card program.\n\nThe EB-5 was most recently modified by Congress through the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, or RIA. The RIA gave the Department of Homeland Security better oversight tools, strengthened the vetting process by requiring background checks for a greater range of individuals involved in EB-5 investment projects, and created an \u201cEB-5 Integrity Fund\u201d to support compliance investigations.\n\nCriticisms of the EB-5\u2019s potential for fraud are thus not new, and while the EB-5 was an avenue for some high-profile fraud cases the overall rate of proven fraud was rare even before the reforms were passed. In the last quarter of fiscal year 2024 only 3 percent of EB-5 petitions filed after RIA were denied, indicating that even with increased scrutiny most applicants and investment projects meet the necessary criteria.\n\nOne reason the EB-5 program seems to be safe for now is that interest in it is on the rise. Fiscal year 2024 saw the greatest number of applications for EB-5 visas since 2020, and one analysis estimates that the EB-5 needs a 30 percent increase in the number of visas it has in order to keep up with demand. This excess demand could theoretically be diverted towards the gold card program instead.\n\nWhat new concerns does the gold card raise?\n\nThe administration will struggle to balance its desired speed of implementation with the rigor of vetting necessary to ensure the gold card program does not create any national security risks\u2014especially since a large number of applicants will be from China.\n\nIn 2024, about 70 percent of all EB-5 applications came from Chinese nationals. China also has the second largest number of millionaires in the world, surpassed only by the U.S. itself. The gold card will thus need to draw heavily from the Chinese business class to meet its fiscal targets.\n\nThis will become a significant complication for the program as it could become a way for China to skirt key U.S. restrictions. For example, the Senate is currently poised to advance a bipartisan bill banning Chinese enterprises and individuals from buying land near U.S. military bases. But with the gold card, wealthy Chinese individuals connected to the Chinese Communist Party would be able to evade these bans by first acquiring U.S. citizenship.\n\nUnlike the EB-5, which requires a personal investment and gives visas only to the investor and the investor\u2019s spouse and minor children, the gold card can be purchased on behalf of someone else, so it will require more careful vetting of both the funder and the beneficiary.\n\nOn a domestic level, the gold card also seems poised to create a rift within the Republican Party. As the party turns increasingly skeptical of globalism and even legal immigration, selling American citizenship to the world\u2019s wealthy elite and granting them the ability to wield greater influence on American politics could be met with resistance. For example, a European millionaire could hypothetically secure a gold card and then use it to get around Federal Election Commission restrictions on political spending by foreign nationals to advocate for progressive causes.\n\nIf the gold card program does wind up providing tax exemptions for recipients on income earned outside of the U.S., it would also create a two-tiered system where gold card holders enjoy a more privileged level of citizenship than natural-born Americans, who are subject to tax on such income.\n\nOn top of these issues, the gold card will almost certainly falter in its core mission of creating a significant new stream of government revenue.\n\nIs the gold card program likely to reduce the national debt?\n\nThe gold card cannot be projected to generate $5 trillion in revenue\u2014Trump\u2019s stated goal\u2014under any reasonable set of assumptions.\n\nAccording to the Henley & Partners 2024 Global Wealth Migration Report, an estimated 135,000 millionaires will move to a new country in 2025. If historical trends hold, the U.S. can expect to attract a little more than 3 percent of that flow, or about 4,000 millionaires.\n\nEven if the U.S. somehow sold every single millionaire estimated to move in 2025 a gold card, this would come out to only $675 billion dollars, and many millionaires aren\u2019t wealthy enough to afford a $5 million flat payment. The gold card program would therefore need to rely on very high net-worth individuals and corporations willing to pay the fee on behalf of an applicant in order to drum up the target revenue, but both of these also have significant limitations. There are only 29,350 people in the world with a net worth of more than $100 million, and a third of them already live in the United States. For their part, corporations have little incentive to pay such a high amount for an employee who would otherwise be tied to working for them through a similar and far less expensive pathway like the H-1B visa.\n\nWhile these financial obstacles are daunting, they pale in comparison to the ones the gold card faces for becoming law to begin with.\n\nHow might the administration implement the gold card?\n\nCreating the gold card visa would require an act of Congress. Under the U.S. Constitution and immigration laws, only Congress can establish new immigrant visa categories or modify the criteria for issuing green cards\u200b. The EB-5 program itself was created by statute as part of the Immigration Act of 1990.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets annual numerical limits and eligibility rules for immigrant visas. The EB-5 investor visa is part of the employment-based immigration quota (capped at roughly 10,000 visas for investors each year, out of 140,000 employment-based visas). Issuing 1 million gold cards would go far beyond these existing limits. Unless Congress amends the INA to create a separate uncapped category or significantly raise caps, the administration simply cannot issue unlimited green cards.\n\nThe Trump administration might attempt interim measures, but each faces legal limitations. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does have authority to set certain regulations for the EB-5 program, such as adjusting investment amounts for inflation, and in 2019 DHS raised the minimum investment from $500,000 to $900,000 by regulation. However, transforming EB-5 into the \u201cgold card\u201d by raising the minimum to $5 million, scrapping the job requirement, and redirecting funds to the U.S. Treasury would almost certainly exceed the statutory authority of DHS. Another option, as discussed by David Bier of the Cato Institute, would be for DHS to try to use its parole authority or other non-immigrant visa categories to approximate a gold card visa program. For instance, the administration might set up a parole program for investors who contribute $5 million, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. temporarily as a \u201csignificant public benefit.\u201d The Obama administration did something similar on a smaller scale with the International Entrepreneur Rule, using parole to admit startup founders. However, parole is not permanent residency and does not confer a path to citizenship or a green card, and would likely generate little interest as a result. The Trump administration also has abolished Biden-era parole programs by claiming that the use of categorical parole exceeds its intended purpose.",

            "content": "Details\n\nTranscript\n\nINTRO\n\nEmployers in the technology industry are preparing for monumental changes in immigration enforcement under the new presidential administration, from increased ICE site visits to I-9 audits.\n\nOn this episode of We get work\u2122, we speak with Jaimie Cremeans, Director of Immigration Counsel at RingCentral. Jaimie shares what she and other technology employers should consider and how they can work collaboratively with other company stakeholders to best safeguard their business.\n\nOur co-host today is Kimberly Bennett, associate in Jackson Lewis\u2019 Pittsburgh office and a member of the Immigration and Technology groups.\n\nKim and Jaimie, the question on everyone\u2019s mind today is what can technology employers do to stay ahead of, and best prepare for, potential enforcement efforts, and how does that impact my business?\n\nCONTENT\n\nKimberly M. Bennett\n\nAssociate, Pittsburgh\n\nThank you so much for joining, Jaimie. I'm looking forward to speaking with you today. So, let's just go ahead and get right into it. As the director of immigration for a technology company, what are some of the things that you're worried about today in immigration?\n\nJaimie Cremeans\n\nDirector, Immigration Counsel at RingCentral\n\nA few things. So, a lot of it at this point is primarily speculative because there hasn't been a ton of action directly affecting employment-based visas at this point. The main things I'm concerned about, first of all, enhanced visa vetting is going to potentially cause some delays in visas. Anyone who works on employment-based visas, particularly in the tech industry, would know that we want to move quickly. So, if we're filing a visa for somebody, we want them to get approved right away. This enhanced visa vetting could potentially cause delays in getting people over here.\n\nThe other piece I'm concerned about is just a stricter interpretation of the qualifications, like what happened in the last Trump administration as far as H-1Bs, L-1s and other employment-based visas. The enhanced scrutiny, taking the strictest interpretation of the law to try to increase denials, RFEs and things like that.\n\nThe last few things, obviously with all of these recent cuts in the government, I'm a little bit concerned about USCIS and DOL delays in processing PERM cases and other filings. What is going to happen if we start cutting employees in those departments, which already are a little bit slow, particularly the DOL processing times right now?\n\nThen, generally, enforcement. Enforcement is going to be a bigger piece of the Trump administration this time around. DOL audits, I-9 audits and getting into our PERM and public access files. So, those are the main things that I'm particularly concerned about and preparing for on our end.\n\nBennett\n\nThose are all valid concerns, and I feel the same way. Well, let's start with the executive orders and with what has already happened. Then, what we maybe see coming down the pike, even if there hasn't been an executive order issued yet.\n\nYou mentioned enhanced visa vetting. So, let\u2019s start there and talk about what exactly we mean when we say enhanced visa vetting.\n\nCremeans\n\nFor me, particularly because the Executive Order specifically says enhanced visa vetting, it seems to be more aimed at security, worried about people coming from different countries and particularly targeting extra security vetting.\n\nMy biggest concern is consulates and consular processing of visas. That is where we're probably going to see the most significant delays. We're already seeing these, frankly, in some of our cases. I have a case right now that's been in administrative processing for eight months. So, it's already pretty long if they get stuck in administrative processing. My concern is just what happens if that increases. In that one particular case that we have, I'm constantly being asked to follow up and see what we can do. Frankly, there's just not much you can do if they're stuck in security processing. For me, that is the biggest concern. Obviously, USCIS increased vetting is another concern of mine, but I'm more concerned with the parts that you have less control over, in my opinion.\n\nBennett\n\nWe both know very well that if you get stuck in administrative processing, it really is a black box, and there's really not much you can do. Those are not fun.\n\nActually, you mentioned you're already seeing this at the embassies and consulates. We are as well. The Department of State did resurrect an old outreach email, clientverification@state.gov. That email, so far as we have seen, is being used to confirm that contractors placed in third-party worksites are, in fact, being placed at those worksites. So, we have actually had a client that received one of those emails for someone who is not one of their employees, but they hired a contractor, and this person will actually be placed at their worksite. So, they did receive an email verifying that. Particularly for technology companies that are using a lot of contract work or have people being placed on their worksites as the end clients, we are going to see increased scrutiny using that old outreach email.\n\nCremeans\n\nThankfully, we do not do that much, so I'm not super concerned about that. I do understand why that would be a concern for a lot of tech companies since that is a very common model in the industry.\n\nBennett\n\nWhat are some other executive orders that we're seeing that are not necessarily related to enhanced visa vetting? What else are you worried about?\n\nCremeans\n\nA lot of the executive orders, so far, are not particularly targeting employment-based things that directly affect us. However, there are some things that could potentially lead to limiting overall visa categories and options for people.\n\nSo, getting to the America First Trade Policy Executive Order, again, we don't know exactly what that's going to look like when it all shapes up. There is the possibility that they could restrict TN visas, which obviously would cause concern if you're pulling talent from Canada or Mexico. We have some of these, so that would be something that I'd be concerned about, particularly for extensions. If we already have people on these visas and they get rid of an employment category, I don't know what that would mean exactly. So, again, it is a little bit of an unknown, but something to keep an eye on and be a little concerned about.\n\nWe also have limits to other statuses that have been targeted. For instance, it looks like TPS is going to start limiting the number of countries that are available. Venezuela, for instance, has already been targeted. There could be more coming. We don't really know what's going to happen with Ukraine. We do have some employees on Ukrainian TPS, so that could be a potential concern, depending on how that shapes up. Refugee statuses, again, I know this is not employment-based, but probably some companies do have people on these statuses. For the continuity of employees and keeping people who are already employees on their statuses, this is something to be concerned about. We may need to start sponsoring people who are otherwise not on sponsored visas and maybe just increase awareness of these things so that employees can come to us if they're on status because we can't go through I-9 records and start reaching out to people. But I think increased awareness for people who might be on these statuses that, hey, we maybe need to look into employment-sponsored options for you to keep you.\n\nBennett\n\nYou mentioned the America First Trade Policy EO, which reminds me of the old EO Buy American, Hire American. I am wondering, back in the prior Trump administration, did you have to make any changes as to how you were filing petitions or how you were presenting petitions? What are you anticipating this time around, and do you think it is going to be a callback to that policy?\n\nCremeans\n\nIt is very similar to the Buy American Hire American EO, and that's the trend that we can probably expect, but again, we don't really know for sure. They have already also rescinded some prior executive orders that were aimed at helping to make visa processing more efficient, particularly through USCIS. That was what we saw last time, in addition to the strictest interpretation of regulations. Specialty occupation was really under scrutiny. I remember seeing people who were here for 10 years on an H1B who were told they don't qualify for H1B status and things like that. So, strict interpretation of the actual legal standards potentially just makes things a little bit more difficult. We may see increased filing fees, possibly down the pipeline, and longer processing times. They already extended the premium processing timelines last year, making it 15 business days as opposed to 15 calendar days. I think things like that, unfortunately, could start happening just in line with this \u2018America first\u2019 idea that they want to basically make it more difficult to hire foreign talent as opposed to U.S. talent.\n\nBennett\n\nI am wondering if we need to have a mini-PERM recruitment for every visa petition just to show that there aren't U.S. workers able to take a job every time you file a visa petition for somebody.\n\nThe other interesting thing to note is that last year, under the Biden administration, we saw a lot of changes being made to USCIS policy that were more friendly to STEM occupations and STEM applicants. It will be interesting to see what will happen with regard to those changes because, with tech companies, you're hiring for a lot of STEM positions. I am curious to see what changes these policies will actually have on the adjudications themselves.\n\nCremeans\n\nParticularly with the O1, it was huge having that STEM guidance in the policy manual that you could cite. It made a difference in our cases. We have had a lot of success with O1s for STEM occupations over the last couple of years, which obviously before was a little bit trickier. They were harder on those applications in the past. I am also curious to see what happens with that. If they keep that guidance in there and if they're going to continue to allow that to be basically a better, more secure option because the H1-B cap is clearly limited. L1 is also limited because if you're hiring new talent or if someone hasn't been with your company for a year, there's not much you can do there other than rely on the lottery, which is not ideal. So, having that O1 option available to people was really helpful. I'm curious about what's going to happen with that, too.\n\nBennett\n\nAlong those lines, what do you anticipate seeing in terms of rescission of prior orders or backtracking on any policy changes that were made under the Biden administration? What do you expect? We might see those STEM-specific policy changes go away. We did talk about the increased vetting. I see more RFEs and more denials. What about you?\n\nCremeans\n\nFrom a preparation perspective, going back through old petitions from the prior administration might be helpful just to get a sense of how it was four years ago, but remembering what to expect and the types of denials and RFEs we were getting might be helpful. Level one wage RFEs I could see coming back. That was a big issue back in the prior administration. I don't see any changes that the Biden administration made that wouldn't be easily undone in that regard.\n\nTo that point, there were a couple of things that the Biden administration did put into the federal rules, like the new specialty occupation definition, which allows for a broader range of degrees to be accepted. So, that's something that would be helpful because there is actually a federal rule that you can cite now.\n\nSame with the deference to prior approvals. That was a huge issue since, as I said, people who had been in H1B status are now being told that they're not qualified. Having it in a federal rule that you can really go back and deny things for fraud, misrepresentation and things like that. We don't want to have people getting denied for something that they previously qualified for that really hasn't changed. That is helpful that some of those things have been put in federal rule. They can be undone, but it is a little bit more difficult. You can't just sign an executive order or issue agency guidance to say this is what we're doing now. But again, the bigger things are probably going to be the things that they can do with easy action, like increasing filing fees, decreasing productivity and making premium processing a little bit longer. Last time I remember, there was a rule that was in the process that the Biden administration did not go forward with to actually change the H1B lottery to make it wage-based. So, these are the things I'm a little concerned about.\n\nAgain, getting back to the STEM-specific reasons why this is important. A lot of people in STEM OPT are clearly reliant on the H1B lottery. They're not usually going to qualify for those O1s yet because they're just out of college and have only been working for a couple of years and it would be really difficult for them to advance that far. So, the H1B is really truly the only option for a lot of our recent grads. If they start making it wage-based, that would obviously be huge because unless they're at level four or level three, they're just not going to get selected in the lottery. That's a little unrealistic for recent grads. It would take a whole talent pool basically out of the picture, which is obviously a concern.\n\nBennett\n\nYou raised STEM OPT. How concerned are you that the STEM OPT work authorization will go away?\n\nCremeans\n\nPretty concerned. One of our biggest talent pools is recent grads, and a lot of them happen to be on OPT. It just limits their chances. They would only get one chance at the lottery as opposed to three. We would probably end up having to pursue alternative options or just not hiring people who are on OPT because we just know that it's limited in duration. Having those three years makes a big difference because a lot of people get selected for their last year of STEM OPT. Also, if they've been around for a couple of years, it makes it easier to justify making alternative solutions for them, like sending them abroad for a year and then bringing them back on an L1 if we really want to keep that talent. If they're only around for six months to a year, it's difficult to assess whether it's worth it, frankly, because it's very expensive, obviously, to get them a visa in another country, send them to Canada, Europe, India or wherever we decide to send them for a year and then bring them back. So, it's something that having a couple of years to really get to know an employee from an employer's perspective makes a huge difference in what we're willing to do to sponsor them.\n\nBennett\n\nLet's move on to how are you preparing for all of the changes that we just discussed?\n\nCremeans\n\nActually, I was just at our headquarters last week and going through some of the physical documents that we have because, pre-COVID, we were keeping public access files and PERM audit files physically and not storing them electronically. So, that's one project on my to-do list for this next quarter, which is to make another trip out there and get all of those files transitioned to electronic storage. That's important because I am a remote employee and not at headquarters. If something happens and we are asked to give files to the DOL, we only have three days to do it. So, I want to be prepared and make sure that I can at least access everything quickly and have it ready.\n\nAnother thing that we need to do is make sure our HR teams and people who are at headquarters are on site. If the attorney or whoever is in charge of your audit files is not there, make sure that they know, number one, whom to contact if somebody shows up. Then just prepare them. I am probably going to put together a short document for each of our HR people at our different sites, letting them know what to do if somebody shows up. It is important to just make sure the people who are going to be on the front lines receiving these requests will be there when somebody shows up for a site visit for a DOL audit or for an I-9 audit. Making sure they know what to do, what to look for, how to check the warrant, how to make sure that it's valid and knowing exactly what they're looking for before they just start letting somebody on site and then again, who to contact. So, obviously, in my company, that would be me. In companies that do not have in-house immigration counsel, it is important to make sure everybody has the contact for your outside counsel or whoever handles your immigration processes. Having somebody internally, maybe on your legal team or in HR, who you trust to be the one to really interface and make sure that you are managing everything properly.\n\nBennett\n\nThat is really good advice. I know that right now, in the news, it's all about ICE raids, but I think that that same advice can be given whether we're talking about ICE or the fraud group that inspects H1B and L1 fraud or an I9 audit. The advice that you just gave is the same regardless of the kind of immigration enforcement or which body is actually doing the enforcement.\n\nYou mentioned reviewing your PERM audit files and your public access files to make sure that those are in compliance. I think it's important for us to touch on I-9 compliance quickly. You had said, for instance, that you were keeping your H1B public access files, prior to the pandemic, in hard copy. I know that technology companies embrace technology, so a lot of them may be keeping their I9s electronically as well. What are some of the concerns that you have, maybe not for your company specifically, but just generally about I9 compliance and the electronic files or even paper files? What are some things that people should pay attention to?\n\nCremeans\n\nGenerally, it's something we can expect, potentially, I9 audits over the next four years. It doesn't hurt to go ahead and do an internal audit. That's, again, something that is on my to-do list for this year. Obviously, you have the chance to make corrections if you do an internal audit, which is helpful. It also helps just to know where you are and know where you stand with everything.\n\nWe actually use a vendor. It's a little bit different in my company as far as we don't manage the storage of the I9s and make sure that they're completed properly and that all is outsourced to a vendor. One important thing to note for other companies that may use vendors is that you're still liable at the end of the day. So, it is important to make sure that somebody in your company, whether it's HR, legal or whoever is managing that vendor, is making sure that they're doing everything properly.\n\nAlso, at the end of the day, too, you're responsible for re-verifications. So, something to know is that even if the vendor is managing everything, somebody needs to be in charge of logging in and getting alerts. I know that our vendor will send alerts when somebody\u2019s documents expire, but they may not be with the company anymore. The vendor isn't going to automatically reach out to do an I9 re-verification. That is on the employer to go in, click that button and say that. So, I got off on a little side tangent about vendors, but I just thought that it was important to note because I think a lot of companies do use them. It's helpful and easy to do because it saves you resources internally. You don't have to hire as many people in HR to manage all of these I-9s. But again, there are some pitfalls, so these are just things to be aware of.\n\nBut with respect to your overall question, I think a lot of the COVID changes because the I9 process was changing constantly during COVID. It doesn't hurt to go back through and just make sure that your files are being kept in compliance with the regulations. For example, they changed, I want to say, every six months throughout the pandemic; it was something like that as far as what you actually had to do and how you were actually supposed to be verifying these documents remotely versus in person. So, I would say go back and review the different guidance that was in place during those times and just make sure that you did keep everything in accordance with the guidance at the time.\n\nA big thing we talked about in preparation for this podcast was the fact that you actually had to video somebody seeing the documents and keep that video. I know we have videos from when we did that. So, just little things like that were different and everybody was adjusting constantly. It doesn't hurt to go back through, particularly that time period where it got very confusing, and just reread the guidance and make sure that everything was done in accordance with what was required at the time.\n\nBennett\n\nThat is a really good point, especially the live video. It is really important to go back and make sure that you actually are doing it correctly and that you did it correctly at the time as well.\n\nSo, I think that's all. I know we covered a lot, but I think you gave really good advice that can be applicable to not only technology companies but really any company. So, thank you so much for your time.\n\nCremeans\n\nNo problem. Thank you so much for having me. I'm happy to come back anytime and talk about these issues as they unfold and as we get more information about what's actually going to be happening.\n\nOUTRO\n\nThank you for joining us on We get work\u00ae.

            "content": "April 2025 Visa Bulletin \u2013 More Favorable for Migration\n\nThe State Department has published the April Visa Bulletin. Categories that were grounded in March may finally stretch their wings in April, including EB-1 India, EB-3 Other Workers China, and EB-3 Professionals All Other Countries. In addition, some categories that saw modest movement in March have gained momentum in April, most notably EB-2 China, which flew ahead almost 5 months, compared to only 16 days in March.\n\nBelow is a summary that includes Final Action Dates and changes from the previous month, but first \u2013 some background if you\u2019re new to these blog posts. If you\u2019re an old hand at the Visa Bulletin, feel free to skip the next paragraph.\n\nThe Visa Bulletin is released monthly by the US Department of State (in collaboration with US Citizenship and Immigration Services). If your priority date (that is, the date you got a place on the waiting list) is earlier than the cutoff date listed in the Bulletin for your nationality and category, that means a visa number is available for you that month. That, in turn, means you can submit your DS-260 immigrant visa application (if you\u2019re applying at a US embassy abroad) or your I-485 adjustment of status application (if you\u2019re applying with USCIS). If you already submitted that final step and your category then retrogressed, it means the embassy or USCIS can now approve your application because a visa number is again available.\n\nNow for the April VB \u2013\n\nIndia moves forward in all categories:\n\nEB-1 advances 2 weeks to February 15, 2022\n\n2 weeks to February 15, 2022 EB-2 advances 1 month to January 1, 2013\n\n1 month to January 1, 2013 EB-3 Professionals and EB-3 Other Workers advance 2 months to April 1, 2013\n\nChina progresses in all categories but one:\n\nEB-1 remains stalled at November 8, 2022\n\nEB-2 advances almost 5 months to October 1, 2020\n\nalmost 5 months to October 1, 2020 EB-3 Professionals advances 3 months to November 1, 2020\n\n3 months to November 1, 2020 EB-3 Other Workers advances 3 months to April 1, 2017\n\nAll Other Countries also makes gains in all categories:\n\nEB-1 remains current\n\nEB-2 advances 1 month + 1 week to June 22, 2023\n\n1 month + 1 week to June 22, 2023 EB-3 Professionals advances 1 month to January 1, 2023\n\n1 month to January 1, 2023 EB-3 Other Workers advances almost 4 months to May 22, 2021\n\nNOTE 1: USCIS will accept I-485 applications in April based on Final Action Dates, not the more favorable Dates for Filing chart.",

            "content": "Touted as a way to raise revenue, a \u201cgold card\u201d visa program announced by President Donald Trump last month would require a $5 million payment in exchange for permanent residency and a pathway to citizenship.\n\nWhile the astronomical price tag is the most eye-catching aspect of the proposal, it diverges from similar offerings like the EB-5 investor visa in that the fee can be paid on behalf of somebody else and would also seemingly exempt recipients from having to pay taxes on income earned overseas.\n\nThe gold card\u2019s primary purpose is to create a new revenue stream large enough to offset the estimated $4.5 trillion increase in new deficits under the administration\u2019s proposed budget. Trump has set an ambitious goal to sell 1 million gold cards, which would generate $5 trillion for the government.\n\nApart from the fiscal benefits, during his March 4 address to Congress, Trump also touted the gold card as a way to ensure the U.S. attracts and retains wealthy immigrants despite the administration\u2019s sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nWhile details are sparse ahead of a tentative launch date in March, the information that is available bodes poorly for the gold card\u2019s chances of successful and speedy implementation.\n\nWhat is the precedent for the gold card, and how have similar visa programs fared?\n\nThe gold card was first presented as taking the place of the EB-5 investor visa program, which allocates roughly 10,000 visas\u2014the first step to getting a green card that allows permanent legal residency\u2014each year for individuals who make an $1.05 million investment (with a provision allowing for a lower $800,000 investment in \u201ctargeted employment areas\u201d) that creates or saves 10 American jobs.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who appears to be one of the main architects of the gold card proposal, characterized the EB-5 in his remarks as \u201cfull of nonsense, make believe, and fraud.\u201d Since then, the administration has indicated that while the EB-5 will be restructured, it will remain in place alongside the new gold card program.\n\nThe EB-5 was most recently modified by Congress through the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, or RIA. The RIA gave the Department of Homeland Security better oversight tools, strengthened the vetting process by requiring background checks for a greater range of individuals involved in EB-5 investment projects, and created an \u201cEB-5 Integrity Fund\u201d to support compliance investigations.\n\nCriticisms of the EB-5\u2019s potential for fraud are thus not new, and while the EB-5 was an avenue for some high-profile fraud cases the overall rate of proven fraud was rare even before the reforms were passed. In the last quarter of fiscal year 2024 only 3 percent of EB-5 petitions filed after RIA were denied, indicating that even with increased scrutiny most applicants and investment projects meet the necessary criteria.\n\nOne reason the EB-5 program seems to be safe for now is that interest in it is on the rise. Fiscal year 2024 saw the greatest number of applications for EB-5 visas since 2020, and one analysis estimates that the EB-5 needs a 30 percent increase in the number of visas it has in order to keep up with demand. This excess demand could theoretically be diverted towards the gold card program instead.\n\nWhat new concerns does the gold card raise?\n\nThe administration will struggle to balance its desired speed of implementation with the rigor of vetting necessary to ensure the gold card program does not create any national security risks\u2014especially since a large number of applicants will be from China.\n\nIn 2024, about 70 percent of all EB-5 applications came from Chinese nationals. China also has the second largest number of millionaires in the world, surpassed only by the U.S. itself. The gold card will thus need to draw heavily from the Chinese business class to meet its fiscal targets.\n\nThis will become a significant complication for the program as it could become a way for China to skirt key U.S. restrictions. For example, the Senate is currently poised to advance a bipartisan bill banning Chinese enterprises and individuals from buying land near U.S. military bases. But with the gold card, wealthy Chinese individuals connected to the Chinese Communist Party would be able to evade these bans by first acquiring U.S. citizenship.\n\nUnlike the EB-5, which requires a personal investment and gives visas only to the investor and the investor\u2019s spouse and minor children, the gold card can be purchased on behalf of someone else, so it will require more careful vetting of both the funder and the beneficiary.\n\nOn a domestic level, the gold card also seems poised to create a rift within the Republican Party. As the party turns increasingly skeptical of globalism and even legal immigration, selling American citizenship to the world\u2019s wealthy elite and granting them the ability to wield greater influence on American politics could be met with resistance. For example, a European millionaire could hypothetically secure a gold card and then use it to get around Federal Election Commission restrictions on political spending by foreign nationals to advocate for progressive causes.\n\nIf the gold card program does wind up providing tax exemptions for recipients on income earned outside of the U.S., it would also create a two-tiered system where gold card holders enjoy a more privileged level of citizenship than natural-born Americans, who are subject to tax on such income.\n\nOn top of these issues, the gold card will almost certainly falter in its core mission of creating a significant new stream of government revenue.\n\nIs the gold card program likely to reduce the national debt?\n\nThe gold card cannot be projected to generate $5 trillion in revenue\u2014Trump\u2019s stated goal\u2014under any reasonable set of assumptions.\n\nAccording to the Henley & Partners 2024 Global Wealth Migration Report, an estimated 135,000 millionaires will move to a new country in 2025. If historical trends hold, the U.S. can expect to attract a little more than 3 percent of that flow, or about 4,000 millionaires.\n\nEven if the U.S. somehow sold every single millionaire estimated to move in 2025 a gold card, this would come out to only $675 billion dollars, and many millionaires aren\u2019t wealthy enough to afford a $5 million flat payment. The gold card program would therefore need to rely on very high net-worth individuals and corporations willing to pay the fee on behalf of an applicant in order to drum up the target revenue, but both of these also have significant limitations. There are only 29,350 people in the world with a net worth of more than $100 million, and a third of them already live in the United States. For their part, corporations have little incentive to pay such a high amount for an employee who would otherwise be tied to working for them through a similar and far less expensive pathway like the H-1B visa.\n\nWhile these financial obstacles are daunting, they pale in comparison to the ones the gold card faces for becoming law to begin with.\n\nHow might the administration implement the gold card?\n\nCreating the gold card visa would require an act of Congress. Under the U.S. Constitution and immigration laws, only Congress can establish new immigrant visa categories or modify the criteria for issuing green cards\u200b. The EB-5 program itself was created by statute as part of the Immigration Act of 1990.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets annual numerical limits and eligibility rules for immigrant visas. The EB-5 investor visa is part of the employment-based immigration quota (capped at roughly 10,000 visas for investors each year, out of 140,000 employment-based visas). Issuing 1 million gold cards would go far beyond these existing limits. Unless Congress amends the INA to create a separate uncapped category or significantly raise caps, the administration simply cannot issue unlimited green cards.\n\nThe Trump administration might attempt interim measures, but each faces legal limitations. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does have authority to set certain regulations for the EB-5 program, such as adjusting investment amounts for inflation, and in 2019 DHS raised the minimum investment from $500,000 to $900,000 by regulation. However, transforming EB-5 into the \u201cgold card\u201d by raising the minimum to $5 million, scrapping the job requirement, and redirecting funds to the U.S. Treasury would almost certainly exceed the statutory authority of DHS. Another option, as discussed by David Bier of the Cato Institute, would be for DHS to try to use its parole authority or other non-immigrant visa categories to approximate a gold card visa program. For instance, the administration might set up a parole program for investors who contribute $5 million, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. temporarily as a \u201csignificant public benefit.\u201d The Obama administration did something similar on a smaller scale with the International Entrepreneur Rule, using parole to admit startup founders. However, parole is not permanent residency and does not confer a path to citizenship or a green card, and would likely generate little interest as a result. The Trump administration also has abolished Biden-era parole programs by claiming that the use of categorical parole exceeds its intended purpose.",

            "content": "Visa says its new anti-fraud disruption department saved potential victims $350 million last year.\n\nThe company\u2019s scam disruption practice, announced Tuesday (March 11), part of Visa\u2019s Payment Ecosystem Risk and Control (PERC), which itself blocked $40 billion in attempted fraud in 2024.\n\n\u201cVisa has invested over $12 billion dollars in technology over the last five years, including to reduce fraud and enhance network security,\u201d Paul Fabara, chief risk and client services officer at Visa, said in a news release.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we have made a significant investment in our best weapon against scammers: our people. By combining our proprietary technology with the unique experiences and perspective our talent brings, we can more effectively identify and defeat even the savviest scammers.\u201d\n\nAccording to the release, Visa Scam Disruption (VSD) includes a \u201ccross-disciplinary team\u201d that deploys strategies to mitigate a range of scams. The unit also conducts \u201cproactive\u201d scam investigations to identify and address scams before they hurt consumers.\n\nIn addition, VSD employs generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools that can help \u201cidentify complex relationships and parse through mass amounts of data to identify true positive and impactful scam activity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about an explosion in scams against banks and their customers, with criminals turning to new technologies and old-fashioned manipulation.\n\n\u201cFraudsters pull at human nature in a bid to gain access to accounts and drain them \u2014 pleading through texts, phone calls and AI prompts for donations, romance, bail to get out of jail and more,\u201d that report said.\n\n\u201cScammers are industrious, becoming more businesslike, moving beyond blast emails toward a personalized approach as they pick their victims.\u201d\n\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence \u2014 from the report \u201cThe Impact of Financial Scams on Consumers\u2019 Finances and Banking Habits\u201d \u2014 found that two types of scams cause more financial damage than average.\n\nIn first place are investment scams, which have a median loss of $1,104, followed by romance scams, with a median loss of $1,996.\n\n\u201cRomance scams also string targets along for an average of 3.6 transactions, which is nearly twice as many as other methods,\u201d PYMNTS wrote.\n\nThis week also saw new findings from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), showing that consumers reported more than $12.5 billion in fraud losses last year. That\u2019s a 25% uptick over 2023, driven not by a rise in the number of reports but an increase in people who reported losing money to a fraud or scam.",

            "content": "President Donald Trump has said he does not need Congress to create so-called gold cards to offer foreign nationals a path to citizenship at the price of $5 million, but immigration policy experts and some Republican lawmakers cast doubt that a president could implement such a plan alone.\n\nAs nebulous as Trump\u2019s proposal stands at this point, current law imposes limits on green cards such as the number of cards that can be issued in the EB-5 program that Trump ultimately wants to replace, as well as the price and conditions for making it happen, experts say.\n\nAnd interviews with Senate Republicans engaged on homeland security and immigration issues suggest any legislative plans for authorization of the gold card was not at the forefront of their minds.\n\nShev Dalal-Dheini, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said any creation of a new visa category \u201chas to be done by statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether you create a new category or get rid of a different category, you need a statute to do so,\u201d Dalal-Dheini said. \u201cAnd even if it was a question about raising the limit of how much money is invested into the EB-5 program, that\u2019s also statutorily so it will require some congressional action to make this go forward.\u201d\n\nEric Ruark, who focuses on research at NumbersUSA, a group that wants to reduce immigration, said Tuesday that much of the proposal isn\u2019t fleshed out and \u201cobviously we can\u2019t do this without Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change the statutory allocation of green cards simply by executive order,\u201d Ruark said.\n\nOne libertarian think tank sees a narrow path for Trump to implement his gold card under executive authority. The CATO Institute\u2019s David J. Bier wrote in a Feb. 26 blog post that there is no authority to make radical changes, but Trump could use his \u201cparole\u201d authority to grant short-term lawful residence to people willing to pay $5 million.\n\nBeyond that, Bier wrote such \u201cgreen card privileges\u201d and a path to citizenship can only come from an actual green card. \u201cIt is doubtful that wealthy people would pay $5 million for something with dubious legal standing or a temporary status that could be rescinded at any time,\u201d Bier wrote.\n\nTrump, when he first publicly spoke about the idea last month in the Oval Office of the White House, told reporters he doesn\u2019t need Congress to pass a law on the plan because the gold card is \u201ca very strong path to citizenship, but we\u2019re not doing the citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It\u2019s totally legal to do,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAnd Trump, in a joint address to Congress last week, did not ask Congress to act on the idea and said the gold cards will go on sale \u201cvery, very soon\u201d to allow \u201cjob-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship.\u201d\n\nTrump touted the proposal as means to balance the federal deficit. \u201cFor $5 million, we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump was light on the details, but said the gold card would be like a \u201cgreen card but better and more sophisticated.\u201d Gold card recipients, Trump said, would have to pay a tax in the United States and create jobs. Trump billed the plan as a way to keep in the United States immigrants who come for a college education.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country instead of having them be \u2014 being forced out,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPreviously, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick offered a few more details of the gold card, saying it would ultimately replace the opportunities for a green card under the EB-5 program.\n\n\u201cSo the president said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we\u2019re going to end the EB-5 program,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\u201d\n\nForeign nationals under the current EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program system need to meet several criteria, including a commitment to invest a minimum amount of capital into a new commercial enterprise in the United States. The standard threshold is $1,050,000, although for certain designated areas with low employment the minimum drops to $800,000.\n\nAnother criterion is being able to create or preserve at least 10 full-time jobs for qualifying U.S. workers within two years of receiving conditional permanent residency. The EB-5 program also has an annual cap of 10,000 visas.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the implementation of the gold card.\n\nDetails pending\n\nImmigration experts said assessing the practical implications of the gold card is difficult, especially under Trump\u2019s assertion he doesn\u2019t need congressional authorization to move forward.\n\nDalal-Dheini questioned whether Trump could meaningfully reduce the deficit with the initiative based on the limited number of visas, which are currently subject to statute. And she said there are serious questions under the proposed gold card about the vetting process for the visas and the potential impact on communities.\n\nUnder the EB-5 program, \u201cit\u2019s not you\u2019re just paying tax to the government, but rather, you are finding ways to invest in American communities and creating American jobs,\u201d Dalal-Dheini said. \u201cAnd so, what seems to be proposed is very different. You\u2019re just paying money to the government, but you\u2019re not actually taking the time to invest into our local communities to make them stronger and to help American workers.\u201d\n\nTrump supporters who favor more limited access to immigration to the United States may also be disappointed in the implementation of the gold card.\n\nRuark of NumbersUSA said the gold card is \u201cnot something that we would support,\u201d although making the case the current EB-5 program is \u201ccertainly rife with fraud\u201d based on the lack of metrics in whether applicants succeed at job creation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like being willing to work for lower wages isn\u2019t a skill,\u201d Ruark added. \u201cHaving $5 million at your disposal to buy a green card is not a skill. And we should be focusing on bringing in people who have skills to integrate into our economy and to our society, not people who have $5 million to purchase a green card.\u201d\n\nRuark said it\u2019s possible Congress could seek to implement a gold card program in the budget reconciliation process. That process is filibuster-proof and focused on budgetary effects but also has limitations that would prevent broad changes to immigration laws.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., expressed uncertainty last week about whether Trump could initiate a gold card by rulemaking or whether it would require congressional authorization. Asked whether senators were discussing legislation to make that happen, Hawley replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that yet, but that\u2019s not to say that there won\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said last week he was uncertain whether the gold card would not need congressional authorization, but added he would be \u201csurprised\u201d if Trump could do it without assent from Congress. Scott added he hasn\u2019t heard any discussion about Congress moving forward with the idea.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, also expressed caution about Trump eliminating the existing EB-5 green card program altogether and said the gold card initiative as proposed by Trump would \u201cprobably\u201d need congressional authorization.\n\nAny gold card system should be enacted on top of the existing program, Paul said, because it has \u201cbeen good for our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should replace the EB-5 because I think there are a lot of people who come to this country with the EB-5 level that might not come at the $5 million level,\u201d Paul said.",

            "content": "(ZENIT News / Washington, 03.12.2025).- The Catholic Church in the United States is facing a growing immigration challenge as a crucial visa program for religious workers is set to expire. The program, which has allowed non-ordained religious workers such as nuns, seminarists, monks, and lay missionaries to obtain permanent residency, will come to an end on March 13. The consequences could be profound, especially for dioceses in rural and underserved areas that heavily rely on foreign-born religious personnel.\n\nA Program That Sustained the Church\u2019s Mission\n\nFor more than three decades, the EB-4 Special Immigrant Religious Worker Visa has been a vital pathway for Catholic institutions to secure long-term residency for non-ministerial religious workers. Unlike the R-1 visa\u2014a temporary visa for religious workers that does not guarantee permanent residency\u2014the EB-4 allowed religious orders and dioceses to sponsor individuals for green cards, providing stability to those dedicated to lifelong service.\n\nThe program issued approximately 5,000 visas annually, supporting workers engaged in roles ranging from education and healthcare to administrative leadership within religious communities. Many of these individuals serve as catechists, teachers, caregivers, or leaders of religious institutions. However, the expiration of this program puts all of these roles at risk.\n\nThe Looming Consequences\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has raised concerns that without legislative action, religious communities could struggle to bring in new members, particularly in vocations requiring a long-term commitment, such as contemplative religious life, but non only. Many of those affected work in healthcare, serving the elderly and terminally ill, or in remote parishes where priests are scarce.\n\nDavid Spicer, deputy director for migration policy at the USCCB, emphasized that while ordained clergy have alternative visa options, non-ministerial religious workers do not. \u201cWe rely heavily on these individuals, and without them, many of our ministries will suffer,\u201d Spicer stated.\n\nThe impact of the program\u2019s expiration is already being felt. Spicer shared the case of a Mother Superior in Alaska who was forced to leave her community due to visa complications. In regions where the Catholic Church depends on foreign-born religious personnel to sustain its mission, such losses are deeply disruptive.\n\nA Race Against Time\n\nThe expiration of the EB-4 program does not immediately affect those who have already secured permanent residency, but it does jeopardize religious workers currently in the U.S. on temporary visas who were waiting for an EB-4 visa slot to become available. Many of these individuals have already spent years in the country, dedicated to their ministry, only to find themselves in bureaucratic limbo just as they approach eligibility for permanent residency.\n\nSpicer noted that unless Congress acts swiftly, those who have been waiting in line for years could see their path to residency abruptly cut off. \u201cThe timing could not be worse. People who are just about to get their green cards may suddenly find that the program no longer exists,\u201d he warned.\n\nA Call for Legislative Action\n\nWhile time is running out, there remains a possibility that Congress could pass a short-term extension, as it has done in the past. The USCCB has been advocating for the program to be made permanent, arguing that the Church cannot afford to lose such a critical resource.\n\nBishop Mark Seitz, chairman of the USCCB\u2019s Committee on Migration, wrote to lawmakers in 2024 urging them to act. He highlighted the growing backlog in EB-4 visa applications, which has made the process increasingly difficult for religious workers. \u201cThe wait times for these visas have reached unprecedented levels,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis small but vital program must be permanently authorized to ensure that religious workers can continue to serve communities in need.\u201d\n\nAn Uncertain Future\n\nAs the March 13 deadline approaches, religious communities across the U.S. are bracing for the potential fallout. If no action is taken, many of the Church\u2019s essential ministries could be left without the personnel they need to function. Whether Congress will act in time remains uncertain, but the Catholic Church is making one thing clear: losing this visa program would be a significant blow, not only to religious communities but to the many people they serve.\n\nThank you for reading our content.

            "content": "Mastercard, on the other hand, has strengthened its business through cybersecurity, data analytics and value-added services. Revenues from these segments grew 17.7% in 2023 and 16.8% in 2024. Mastercard's digital expansion in Southeast Asia and Latin America fuels long-term growth but also introduces additional geopolitical risks. Notably, the company expects adjusted operating expenses to see low-teens growth in 2025.\n\nVisa's emphasis on technological innovation is evident in products like Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning. The company is also capitalizing on emerging payment trends, including Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), crypto, and fintech partnerships. Contactless payments (Tap to Pay) now account for more than 80% of global in-person transactions. However, it anticipates adjusted operating expenses to witness high single-digit to low double-digit growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nIn the U.K., the Payment Systems Regulator is considering fee caps and transparency measures after merchant fees soared, costing businesses an extra \u00a3170 million annually. Additionally, Mastercard was linked to nine unlicensed sites recently and Visa to two, leading to substantial consumer losses. While these challenges could somewhat pressure profitability, both companies maintain strong operational footholds.\n\nBoth Visa and Mastercard are under increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the United States and the U.K. The Credit Card Competition Act of 2023 aims to curb their dominance by increasing competition and reducing merchant costs. However, given the current administration's business-friendly stance, any immediate impact seems unlikely.\n\nCompetitors like American Express Co. and Discover Financial Services continue expanding their networks but remain far behind these two industry leaders. So, which stock offers the better investment opportunity today? Let's start by examining the risks.\n\nVisa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. dominate the payments industry, benefiting from the ongoing global shift toward digital transactions. While they share similar strengths, each has distinct advantages and challenges. With market caps of $641.5 billion (Visa) and $498.5 billion (Mastercard), they form a powerful duopoly, which is often scrutinized by regulators.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 12, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Inc. MA, American Express Co. AXP and Discover Financial Services DFS.\n\nStory Continues\n\nVisa vs. Mastercard: Key Comparisons\n\nDividend Yield\n\nVisa offers a stronger dividend yield (0.69%) compared to Mastercard (0.57%) and industry (0.67%), making it more attractive to income-focused investors. This higher yield reflects Visa's commitment to returning value to its shareholders.\n\nDebt Management\n\nVisa operates with lower financial leverage than Mastercard, indicating a more conservative debt management approach. Its total debt-to-capital of 34.99% is lower than MA's 73.67% and the industry's 43.13%. This lower leverage can provide greater financial stability and flexibility, especially in uncertain economic conditions.\n\nAnalyst Sentiment & Earnings Outlook\n\nAnalysts currently favor Visa over Mastercard, largely due to its stronger U.S. market exposure while Mastercard's greater international exposure could pose more risk due to geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa's fiscal 2025 EPS implies a 12.4% year-over-year uptick, which witnessed 12 upward estimate revisions in the past 60 days against one opposite movement. On the other hand, the consensus mark for Mastercard's 2025 EPS signals 9% year-over-year growth, which has witnessed no upward movement but 14 downward estimate revisions.\n\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\n\nVisa's stronger earnings growth and positive analyst sentiment make it the more compelling choice. Moreover, buying V stock is a more cost-effective option now compared to MA.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nOver the past year, shares of Visa have outperformed Mastercard, the industry and the S&P 500 Index.\n\n1-Year Price Performance \u2013 V, MA, AXP, DFS, Industry & S&P 500\n\nYet, in terms of valuation, Visa is relatively cheaper than Mastercard. Going by its price/earnings ratio, Visa is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 28.63X, lower than Mastercard's 32.71X.\n\nThe Verdict: Visa or Mastercard?\n\nWhile both Visa and Mastercard are strong contenders in the payments industry, current analyses suggest that Visa may offer a more favorable investment opportunity at this time. Its strong U.S. market exposure, attractive valuation and positive analyst outlook position it well for potential investors. Investors should still consider their risk tolerance, as regulatory pressures could impact both firms.\n\nVisa stock, rightfully, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) now, whereas Mastercard stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

He said: \u201cThis move is within their rights as a sovereign nation, but we do not see it as a proportionate response to what UK authorities conveyed to us, which was their observation that a relatively small number of Trinidad and Tobago nationals were misusing the UK immigration system by being processed for an ETA in the normal existing process and then suddenly applying for asylum after arrival.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have indicated our disappointment with the new visa requirement and will continue our consistent engagement with our UK counterparts. We are not of the view that regular travellers to the UK should be negatively affected by a relatively small number of persons who have been trying to abuse the British immigration system.\u201d\n\nA statement from the British high commission in Trinidad and Tobago confirmed that the changes would come into effect immediately, though there would be a six-week transition period lasting until 23 April \u201cduring which time visitors who booked their travel and obtained an ETA before the changes can still enter the UK without a visa\u201d.\n\nThe statement said that the relationship between Trinidad and Tobago remained a \u201cstrong and friendly one\u201d.\n\nThe British high commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago, Jon Dean, said: \u201cThe changes announced today align Trinidad and Tobago with many other visa national countries with which the UK shares close and friendly ties. We understand that travel is important for families, businesses and cultural connections. The introduction of visitor visas is designed to support safe and secure travel while ensuring the UK\u2019s borders remain protected.\n\n\u201cThe British high commission in Port of Spain has worked closely with the UK government to put in place arrangements that allow Trinidad and Tobago nationals to apply for their visitor visas right here at home. We remain committed to welcoming visitors and look forward to continuing the strong ties between our people. As a valued Commonwealth partner, Trinidad and Tobago remains an important part of the UK\u2019s global community.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines UK Free newsletter Get the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the unforgiving geopolitics of the Trump era, we must all be mindful of the fact that even individual actions can have national consequences.\u201d",

Riley Moore, R-W.Va., has been sounding the alarm for weeks over what he sees as the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) exploitation of the American visa program meant for studying in the U.S.\n\nHe is now expected to introduce the Stop Chinese Communist Prying by Vindicating Intellectual Safeguards in Academia Act, or the Stop CCP VISAs Act, on Friday.\n\nJOHN MOOLENAAR: WE DON\u2019T WANT A COMPANY THAT IS AFFILIATED WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY\n\nThe bill is still being circulated for co-sponsors, Fox News Digital was told, but people expected to support the bill include Reps. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Brandon Gill, R-Texas.\n\n\"Every year, we allow nearly 300,000 Chinese nationals to come to the U.S. on student visas. We\u2019ve literally invited the CCP to spy on our military, steal our intellectual property, and threaten national security,\" Moore said.\n\n\"Just last year, the FBI charged five Chinese nationals here on student visas after they were caught photographing joint US-Taiwan live-fire military exercises. This cannot continue.\"\n\nFIRST-EVER 'CHINA WEEK' TAKES AIM AT AMERICA\u2019S DEPENDENCE ON BEIJING\n\nHe called on Congress to act on \"China's exploitation of our student visa program.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s time we turn off the spigot and immediately ban all student visas going to Chinese nationals,\" he said.\n\nThe incident Moore referenced involved five former University of Michigan students who graduated in May as part of a joint program with Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China accused of spying on the U.S. military.\n\nThey are accused of covering up surveillance efforts on a National Guard facility in Michigan during a training operation with the Taiwanese military.\n\nThe former students, all Chinese citizens, were confronted by a sergeant major of the Utah National Guard in August 2023, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court Oct. 1.\n\nMoore's legislation is likely to be challenged by Asian American and progressive groups, as previously similar attempts have been.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe group Asian Americans Advancing Justice previously criticized Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., for calling for a ban on Chinese nationals studying in the U.S.\n\n\"It is unconscionable to suggest limiting the fields of study or remove visa options for all students from China. This rhetoric follows the racial profiling and racist statements made by public officials such as FBI Director Wray and President Trump,\" the group said in 2020.",

The findings were part of a broader examination of a network of gambling sites operating in Europe despite being outlawed.\n\nA spokesperson for Mastercard told PYMNTS the company has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for illegal activity on its network and is investigating the sites in question. Mastercard has no direct relationship with the merchants, and the payments were made via an acquirer.\n\n\u201cAcquirers are responsible for performing due diligence on their customers and ensuring the merchant is properly registered on our network, and acts lawfully, including obtaining and maintaining the required regulatory licenses to operate in all jurisdictions they do business,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAcquirers also must ensure their customers fully comply with Mastercard rules and to never use the network for transactions prohibited by applicable law.\u201d\n\n\u201cVisa is committed to maintaining the integrity of our payment system,\u201d a company spokesperson said in a statement issued to PYMNTS. \u201cWe do not tolerate the use of our network and products for illegal activity, and we are vigilant in our efforts to deter illegal activity on our network.\u201d\n\nThe company added that its integrity risk program is designed to \u201cdeter, detect and remediate noncompliant transactions\u201d and help \u201cnetwork participants that support merchants in legal businesses that are at higher risk for illicit activity maintain proper controls and oversight processes to identify and deter unlawful transactions from entering the Visa payment system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the gambling sector is getting a payments-centric makeover as sportsbooks and online gaming platforms compete for player loyalty.\n\nAfter sports betting was legalized throughout the United States, payments remained a hurdle, as issuing banks tended to block gambling-related transactions, Zak Cutler, president of global gaming at Paysafe, told PYMNTS last month. Even after gaming was legalized, approval rates remained low.\n\nOver time, however, major financial institutions began to recognize the legitimacy of online sports betting, bringing transaction approval rates from single digits to more than 90% at major banks at current rates.\n\n\u201cFast forward five years, and we\u2019ve gone from very few ways to pay \u2014 with a ton of friction \u2014 to a well-optimized space with a variety of payment methods,\u201d Cutler said.",

This is in addition to the $40 billion PERC blocked in attempted fraud on the Visa network last year.\n\n\u201cVisa has invested over $12 billion dollars in technology over the last five years, including to reduce fraud and enhance network security,\u201d said Paul Fabara, Chief Risk and Client Services Officer at Visa. \u201cAt the same time, we have made a significant investment in our best weapon against scammers: our people. By combining our proprietary technology with the unique experiences and perspective our talent brings, we can more effectively identify and defeat even the savviest scammers.\u201d\n\nVisa Scam Disruption (VSD) aims to protect consumers, clients and businesses by leveraging Visa\u2019s deep expertise, technologies, and partnerships:\n\nScam Intelligence: VSD brings together a cross-disciplinary team that deploys mitigation strategies across various scams.

Investigators use Generative AI tools which enable correlation and graphing analysis to identify complex relationships and parse through mass amounts of data to identify true positive and impactful scam activity. Visa then partners with financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and third-party partners to disrupt the scam network infrastructure. By collaborating with key stakeholders, VSD aims to dismantle scam operations and prevent future fraudulent activities.\n\nIn one of the biggest scam networks identified thus far, Visa identified patterns of fraud in merchants tied to \u201cidentity verification.\u201d Using a phishing link sent via a dating website made to look like a legitimate identity verification site, scammers then enrolled the victims in recurring billing cycles. By correlating transactions with IP data and applying advanced logic to the combined set, Visa mapped a network of merchants with similar scam attributes to identify the full infrastructure of the scheme. Visa then shut down nearly 12,000 of these fraudulent merchants. This effort prevented losses of over $37 million in fraud and has been referred to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cFraud usually has no face, but a scam is personal,\u201d said Michael Jabbara, SVP and Global Head of PERC at Visa. \u201cThese scams directly impact the lives of victims, sometimes with devastating effects. Visa also collaborates with intelligence partners, law enforcement, and industry working groups to ensure that not only do we shut these scammers down, but the other members of the ecosystem are also equipped to spot red flags on their own.\u201d\n\nFor more information on how Visa works to protect the ecosystem against fraud of all sizes, visit Visa.com/security.\n\nAbout Visa\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

Professor Jennifer Watling, of Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU), said the restriction, introduced in 2024, has led to a fall in the number overseas admissions. She said international students brought \"value in terms of cultural richness and diversity\" but were also important sources of funding which many universities rely on. A government spokesman said while the UK values the contribution international students make, \"net migration must come down\".\n\nThe Labour government has previously said it has no plans to lift the ban on relatives arriving with international students, which was brought in under the Conservative government to curb migration. International student visa applications have fallen across some universities since the change was introduced according to Home Office figures.\n\nMargarida Vasconcelos said there are many opportunities here in the UK\n\nProf Watling said the cap on fees for domestic students meant universities \"have to obtain income from sources other than UK students\". UK undergraduates fees are set to rise to \u00a39,535 a year from September. International students studying at the same level pay an average of about \u00a322,000 annually, though some pay as much as \u00a338,000, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) said.\n\n'More welcome'",

That is the behavior and activity that this individual engaged in.\"\n\nLeavitt said the Department of Homeland Security provided her with those fliers, which she says were distributed with the help of Khalil on the Columbia University campus and are now on her desk.\n\nTRUMP VOWS ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST MAHMOUD KHALIL WAS 'FIRST ARREST OF MANY TO COME'\n\nShe said she considered bringing them to the briefing but decided against it because she \"didn't think it was worth the dignity of this room to bring that pro-Hamas propaganda.\"\n\n\"This administration is not going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in our country and then siding with pro-terrorist organizations that have killed Americans,\" Leavitt said. \"We have a zero-tolerance policy for siding with terrorists. Period.\"\n\n\n\nA senior State Department official told Fox News that Rubio found Khalil's \"presence and activities in the U.S. would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest, rendering him deportable under Section 237 (a)(4)(C) of the INA [Immigration & Nationality Act].\"\n\nThe official said Section 237 of the Immigration and Nationality Act broadly contains grounds for which an alien who is in the U.S. after having been admitted or having had his or her status adjusted to that of lawful permanent resident may be removed.\n\nFox News is told that Section 237 (a)(4)(C) is a rarely used provision of the law that gives the secretary of state the power to seek to deport \"[a]n alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States\u2026\"\n\nThe senior State Department official stressed this is about national security, not free speech.\n\nKhalil, who was a graduate student at Columbia until December, was taken into custody Saturday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at his university-owned apartment in New York and transported to a detention center in Louisiana.\n\nKhalil was born in Syria to Palestinian parents and entered the U.S. to attend Columbia in 2022. He subsequently got married to an American citizen, who is now eight months pregnant, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams was asked at his own media availability earlier Tuesday about Khalil's \"due process,\" but the Democrat said he wishes his own due process was considered when the Biden Justice Department brought a corruption case against him. \"What I'm finding surprising is the level of support you're all displaying. But I didn't see that support for me,\" Adams told reporters. \"Even after we saw the emails and text messages that there's a potential [that] this is politically motivated.\"\n\nICE AGENTS ARREST ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST WHO LED PROTESTS ON COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS FOR MONTHS\n\n\n\nAdams told reporters, \"Don't be inconsistent in your call for justice, cover those text messages.\" \"That shows that it was potentially politically motivated,\" Adams said of his own case, which the Trump DOJ asked a judge to drop. \"The same enthusiasm I'm getting for you, we should be enthusiastic for everyone. And again, the federal government does immigration and they're doing the investigations, and we need to make sure that it is done in a fair way. That is done.\"\n\nA federal judge in New York City on Monday blocked Khalil's deportation. A hearing is set for Wednesday to weigh motions from his lawyers claiming ICE violated his constitutional rights and asking for him to be moved back to New York.\n\nTrump applauded Khalil's apprehension, saying it is \"the first arrest of many to come,\" while some Democrats are criticizing the move. \"We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again.\"\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-highest ranking Democrat in the chamber, called Khalil\u2019s detention \"straight-up authoritarianism.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters demonstrated in New York City on Monday night demanding Khalil's release and calling for a nationwide walkout of classes is set for noon Tuesday to protest what they deem \"genocide\" against the Palestinian people and the Trump administration's plan to cut federal funding to colleges that permit \"illegal\" protests.\n\nThat student walkout failed to materialize as of early Tuesday afternoon, but a small group of protesters were seen on the steps of Columbia's campus chanting in favor of Khalil's release.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education, meanwhile, sent letters to 60 colleges and universities on Monday saying they were under investigation for alleged \"antisemitic discrimination\" and could lose funding.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Trump administration recently canceled $400 million in grant funding for Columbia. \"Cutting funding to @Columbia\u2019s cancer research doesn\u2019t fight antisemitism, but it does advance Trump\u2019s fight to control higher education in the United States,\" House Judiciary Democrat Rep. Jerry Nadler, of New York, wrote on X.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The conflict has brought renewed attention to Japan's refugee recognition system. To prevent system abuse, a new proposal suggests urging short-term Turkish visitors to obtain a visa before traveling to Japan. This would be an intermediate step between continuing the current visa exemption and suspending it entirely.\n\nThe topic was debated in Japan's National Diet for the first time at the end of January, where government officials responded that they would consider it carefully.\n\nPrevious Suspensions\n\nThis proposed measure, known as the \"Visa Recommendation Measure,\" aims to encourage short-term visitors from visa-exempt countries to obtain a visa in advance. It applies to those staying up to 90 days. As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) website explains, if travelers do not obtain a visa beforehand, they \"will be strictly examined and may be refused entry to Japan.\"\n\nCurrently, Turkish citizens do not need a visa for short-term stays. They can, therefore, travel to Japan with just a passport and apply for refugee status upon arrival. Applicants can remain in Japan for several years while their refugee claims are under review. As a result, the system has reportedly led to an increase in Kurdish individuals seeking employment rather than protection. Among the top ten nationalities applying for refugee status in Japan in 2023, Turkey was the only country whose citizens did not require a visa.\n\nThis situation has fueled public calls for the complete suspension of Turkey's visa exemption. In the past, Japan has implemented this measure for other countries. Specifically, Japan revoked visa exemptions for Bangladesh and Pakistan in 1989 and for Iran in 1992. A rise in unauthorized workers from these countries prompted the decision. Following this, illegal employment from these nations reportedly decreased significantly.\n\nA Temporary Policy?\n\nDuring a parliamentary budget subcommittee session on February 27, Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Akihisa Shiozaki spoke on the issue. Shiozaki pointed out that Japan has previously introduced the Visa Recommendation Measure for certain countries instead of outright revoking their visa exemption. He proposed that Japan consider this approach for Turkey.\n\nJapan's Ministry of Justice is preparing to introduce an electronic travel authorization system called JESTA (Japan Electronic System for Travel Authorization) by 2030. Shiozaki suggested implementing the Visa Recommendation Measure as a temporary policy for five years until JESTA is fully operational.\n\nParliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Hisashi Matsumoto, in his response, maintained the government's existing stance on suspending the visa exemption. \"It contributes to friendly relations between the two countries, and at this point, we do not see an immediate need for suspension,\" he stated.\n\nParliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Hisashi Matsumoto speaking at a subcommittee of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on February 27 (from the House of Representatives Internet TV)\n\nNevertheless, regarding the Visa Recommendation Measure, he acknowledged the \"need to consider its significance and effectiveness while consulting with Turkey carefully.\" This marked the first time the government mentioned the possibility of implementing the measure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPast Cases, Future Changes\n\nAccording to MOFA, Japan currently grants short-term visa exemptions to approximately 70 countries. The Visa Recommendation Measure has only been applied to two South American nations: Peru (since 1995) and Colombia (since 2004).\n\nIn Peru's case, the measure is set to be lifted soon. During a Japan-Peru summit in November 2024, Peru agreed to cooperate with Japan on deportation procedures. As a result, Japan announced that it would restore Peru's full visa exemption within a few months.\n\nAn immigration official commented:\n\n\"As long as foreign workers can enter Japan with only a passport, the issue will continue. However, a strictly enforced Visa Recommendation Measure could greatly deter those arriving solely for employment.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nAuthor: The Sankei Shimbun\n\n\u3053\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u3092 \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e \u3067\u8aad\u3080",

            "content": "10 Mar 2025\n\nDenmark has introduced tighter rules for work permits for foreign students. Authorities found that many students were misusing student residence permits.\n\nDanish officials alleged that international students, particularly those from Nepal, often used student visas mainly to work low-paid jobs. This practice has impacted Denmark\u2019s job market.\n\nDenmark acts on student visa misuse concerns\n\nDanish authorities will soon change rules for international students working on study permits. Immigration Minister Kaare Dybvad Bek announced the changes after police and trade unions reported growing misuse.\n\nRecent reports showed that some students from Nepal attend schools with poor reputations. Many of these students come mainly to work, using student visas to quickly enter the job market.\n\nThis violates current visa rules, which require students to focus on their studies first.\n\n\u201cThe police suspect many Nepalese students arrive with labor migration as their main goal,\u201d Minister Bek stated. He emphasized the need to halt practices that bypass Denmark\u2019s visa rules.\n\n(Image courtesy of Freepik)\n\nCurrent student visa rules at risk\n\nRight now, Denmark lets international students from outside the European Union (EU) work part-time while studying. From September to May, students can work up to 20 hours a week. During summer vacation, they can work full-time.\n\nPartners who come with the students can also work because their permission is tied to the student's visa.\n\nThis arrangement has attracted many students, but authorities reported that it has also caused misuse. Danish officials argued that this leads to unfair conditions in the job market.\n\nSurge in Nepalese students raises red flags\n\nReports show a sudden increase in Nepalese students enrolling in Danish schools.\n\nAbout 1,085 students from Nepal started studying in Denmark in 2024. The year before, only 191 enrolled. Authorities grew concerned because many students chose schools without proper quality controls.\n\nIn total, 2,446 Nepalese students had residence and work permits in Denmark in 2024. Another 1,725 spouses also had permits allowing them to work.\n\nThe quick rise drew the attention of police. They suspected that students were more interested in earning money than studying. Most students took jobs in cleaning, hotels, restaurants, and other low-paid service roles.\n\n(Image courtesy of drobotdean via Freepik)\n\nEducational programs targeted in new measures\n\nDanish education authorities recognize two types of study programs: officially approved and unofficial.\n\nOfficial programs receive careful reviews from Denmark\u2019s education ministry and meet clear standards. Unofficial programs do not go through as many checks, making it easier for students to enroll but also easier to misuse.\n\nMany schools in Copenhagen that attract Nepalese students mostly offer these unofficial courses. Even with more inspections, these schools continued enrolling many international students. This led to increased government attention and public worry.\n\nPlanned reforms aim to close visa loopholes\n\nMinister Bek announced two key reforms targeting visa misuse:\n\nStudents enrolling in unofficial educational programs will lose automatic rights to employment in Denmark. Spouses of these students will no longer receive work permits automatically based on their partner\u2019s student status.\n\nThese measures specifically focus on programs identified as problematic without broadly impacting genuine students attending officially recognized universities.\n\n(Image courtesy of Freepik)\n\nImpact on Denmark\u2019s job market and wages\n\nExperts warned that letting foreign students freely enter Denmark's job market hurts local workers. Hiring students who accept lower pay weakens wage standards and creates unfair competition.\n\nUnion leaders and labor officials are concerned that these practices put Danish workers' rights at risk. They stated that enforcing fair working conditions has become harder.\n\nDenmark\u2019s recent actions aim to make the job market fair again and protect workers from lower wages.\n\nPotential implications for future travel\n\nThe announcement comes as the EU prepares to introduce a new system called the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS).\n\nThe ETIAS aims to better track and manage travelers entering Europe by clearly identifying why visitors are coming.\n\nDenmark\u2019s new rules match the ETIAS\u2019 goals of improving security and transparency.\n\nReal students traveling to Denmark and other EU countries can expect more thorough checks. Students should be ready for detailed questions about their plans and closer inspections at borders, especially if enrolled in unofficial study programs.",

Becky Burke, 28, has spent 11 days in a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing centre in Washington State and was also denied entry into Canada, over a \"visa mix-up\". Speaking to the BBC, Ms Burke said: \"They keep saying in all their booklets that this is not a prison. It's hard to distinguish from my conception of a prison.\" ICE said: \"All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States regardless of nationality.\"\n\nICE said she was being detained at the Northwest ICE Processing Center. Her father, Paul Burke, has urged travellers to be \"very careful\" about their visa requirements. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it could not comment on specific cases for privacy reasons, but added: \"All persons arriving at a port-of-entry to the United States are subject to inspection. \"CBP officers treat all travellers with integrity, respect, professionalism and according to law. \"In the event a foreign national is found inadmissible to the United States, CBP will provide the foreign national an opportunity to procure travel to his or her home country. \"If the foreign national is unable to do so, he or she will be turned over to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) for repatriation.\" The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) confirmed it was supporting a British national. Ms Burke, an artist from Portskewett, Monmouthshire, began backpacking around the US on 7 January. She had flown from New York to Portland, Oregon, where she spent time with a host family, helping with household chores in return for accommodation. At the end of February she travelled to Seattle with plans to travel to Vancouver in Canada to stay with another family. However, when she reached the border, Mr Burke said the Canadian authorities denied her entry as they were concerned she may try to work illegally.\n\nShe described how she spent six hours at the border, waiting while officials were \"trying to determine if what I had been doing in America counted as work\". She said she was \"interrogated\" and, despite explaining she was \"not paid at all\", it was decided she had \"violated\" her visa. Ms Burke said she was being held in a dormitory of 110 people in a \"maxed out\" immigration detention centre in Tacoma, Washington. \"They wake us up at 6:30am. There is never enough time to sleep. It's so cold,\" she said. \"I wear the same jumper for a week. They're short or out of stuff, like blankets and extra clothes. I have one towel.\" She added many of the people she had met were \"stuck\" at the centre, separated from their families - in some cases, for years. \"Everyone is actually really shocked when I explain my situation,\" she added. \"I came to the US for the first time two years ago... I had a great time, that's why I wanted to come back again. I love nature and hiking. Now I see no nature in here at all.\"\n\nAnalysis - North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher\n\nImmigration experts tell the BBC that once Ms Burke informed Canadian officials of her plans and they denied her entry, a suspension of her visa waiver and detention on the US side was probably unavoidable. Many countries strictly interpret what constitutes compensated work - even if no money changes hands. And under the best of circumstances, processing within by the US immigration system can move slowly. Circumstances are far from usual in the US at the moment, however. The Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement across the US, so these experts caution that anyone entering the country should be careful to ensure that all their documents are in order and that they are clear about their intentions upon entering the country. American immigration policy and enforcement is changing under the new administration, and there is less tolerance for even seemingly honest mistakes. Such advice comes too late for Ms Burke, who is currently caught in a bureaucratic limbo. She's trying to stay detached from this, trying to see this as an experience to talk to the people in there and share their stories as well. It's an unusual circumstance - she says she is unlike most of the more than 100 detainees in her building in Tacoma - many of whom have been held for months or even years. She wants to travel back to her home in the UK as soon as possible, while others she speaks to, from places like Mexico, Brazil and Russia, have family in the US and are unwilling or unable to return to their home nations. According to the experts, we probably won't have any advance notice of when she is allowed to get on a plane and leave. It could happen, and her family find out about it after the fact.\n\nMs Burke's dad described the situation as a misunderstanding of her accommodation arrangements, which were \"just like a cultural exchange\". He said Ms Burke got free accommodation for helping host families \"around the house\", which he believes authorities may have suspected broke the terms of her tourist visa.\n\nMr Burke told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he could not understand why his daughter was \"locked up and she's in an orange prison jumpsuit whilst the paperwork gets sorted out\". He said what was meant to be a life-changing backpacking trip \"has turned into a nightmare\".\n\nHe added: \"At first she was just distraught. She was inconsolable. She is allowed to ring out using a shared iPad but we can't call her.\" The dad said, as their family is not American, they cannot add money to Ms Burke's inmate account for her to buy essentials, so they have reached out to some American friends to help. Mr Burke said his daughter just wants to come home and has asked for voluntary departure but it has been \"radio silence\". The family have been told voluntary departure has to be approved by a judge, but added they do not know \"how to make that happen\".\n\nPaul Burke Ms Burke's family says she was \"inconsolable\" at first and just wants to come home\n\nMs Burke's parents said they were in daily contact with the British consulate in San Francisco, which is the nearest one to the detention facility, but claimed \"official channels can't get a clear answer about what is going on\". Melissa Chavin, a US immigration lawyer based in London, said Ms Burke could be released either through voluntary departure or expedited removal, but the process of appearing in front of a judge as part of voluntary departure could be delayed because several dozen of the approximately 700 immigration judges had resigned or been fired by the Trump administration. Trump won the US presidential election last November after promising to strengthen US borders and rigorously enforce immigration law. Ms Chavin said expedited removal \u2013 which allows officials to quickly deport non citizens \u2013 had been expanded under President Trump and could now happen anywhere in the country as opposed to within 100 miles of the border. \"That could work out well for [Ms Burke] \u2013 in that she could leave quicker,\" Ms Chavin said, adding that it would also come with a five-year ban on travelling to the United States. She also urged people travelling to the United States to ensure they can pay for their own accommodation.\n\nMs Burke said she planned the trip before Trump's presidency, but was \"cautious\" and aware she would need to prove that she did not intend to stay in the country. She added she was \"lucky\" compared to some people who were fighting to remain in the country, and were \"stuck between a rock and a hard place\". \"Everyone's story is really sad. No one deserves to be in here. Everyone detained here is so nice,\" she said.\n\nPaul Burke Mr Burke said his daughter had to swap her clothes for an orange jumpsuit",

Homeland Security officials and President Donald Trump have indicated that the arrest was directly tied to his role in the protests last spring at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nKhalil is being held at an immigration detention center in Jena, Louisiana, while he awaits immigration court proceedings.

Green card holders can still be deported for committing certain crimes, failing to notify immigration officials of a change in address or engaging in marriage fraud, for example.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Khalil was taken into custody as a result of Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting antisemitism.\n\nTrump has argued that protesters forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting the Palestinian group Hamas, which controls Gaza and has been designated as a terrorist organization.\n\nKhalil and other student leaders of Columbia University Apartheid Divest have rejected claims of antisemitism, saying they are part of a broader anti-war movement that also includes Jewish students and groups. But the protest coalition, at times, has also voiced support for leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, another Islamist organization designated by the U.S. as a terrorist group.\n\nExperts say that officials seem to indicate with their rhetoric that they are trying to deport Khalil on the grounds that he\u2019s engaging in some sort of terrorist activity or somehow poses a threat.\n\nKhalil has not been convicted of any terrorist-related activity. In fact, he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nBut experts say the federal government has fairly broad authority to arrest and try to deport a green card holder on terrorism grounds.\n\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of something to be \u201cremovable,\u201d Kelley-Widmer said. They could be deported if the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general have reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, she said.\n\nBut Kelley-Widmer said she\u2019s never seen a case where the alleged terrorist activity happened in the U.S., and she questioned whether taking part in protests as Khalil did qualifies.\n\nWhat did ICE say about why they were arresting him?\n\nOne of the key issues in Khalil\u2019s case is what ICE agents said to his lawyer at the time he was arrested.\n\nHis lawyer, Amy Greer, said the agents who took him into custody at his university-owned home near Columbia initially claimed to be acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa.\n\nBut when Greer informed them that Khalil was a permanent resident with a green card, they said they would revoke that documentation instead.\n\nKelley-Widmer said that exchange raises questions about how familiar the agents who arrested him were with the law or whether there was a \u201creal disregard for the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should be really concerned that this is happening,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat are the next steps in his case?\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said in a message posted Sunday on X that the administration will be \u201crevoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d\n\nIf someone is in the country on a student visa, the State Department does have authority to revoke it if the person violates certain conditions. For example, said Florida immigration attorney John Gihon, it\u2019s quite common for the State Department to cancel visas of foreign students who get arrested for drunk driving.\n\nBut when it comes to someone who\u2019s a lawful permanent resident, that generally requires an immigration judge to determine whether they can be deported.\n\nGihon said the next step is that Khalil would receive charging documents explaining why he\u2019s being detained and why the government wants to remove him, as well as a notice to appear in immigration court.\n\nGenerally, he should receive those within 72 hours of being arrested, and then he would make an initial appearance before an immigration judge. That could take from 10 days to a month, Gihon said.\n\nBut he cautioned that right now he\u2019s seeing extensive delays across the immigration court system, with clients often moved around the country to different facilities.\n\n\u201cWe are having people who are detained and then they\u2019re bounced around to multiple different detention facilities. And then sometimes they\u2019re transferred across the country,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "A British tourist on a four-month backpacking trip around North America has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the US for 10 days after trying to enter the country via the Canadian border.\n\nRebecca Burke, 28, a graphic artist from Monmouthshire, was trying to cross into the state of Washington when she was refused entry.\n\nShe was planning to stay with a host family where she would carry out domestic chores in exchange for accommodation and was told she should have applied for a working visa, instead of a tourist visa.\n\nShe had previously been staying with a host family in Portland, Oregon, under a similar arrangement after spending some time sightseeing in New York City, where she first arrived from the UK at the start of the year.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s basically living with a family, doing a little bit of housework, taking the dog for a walk, whatever it is. She\u2019s been a part of a family,\u201d her father, Paul Burke, a consultant in the steel industry, said.\n\nCanadian authorities told her to go back to the US and fill in new paperwork before returning to cross into Canada.\n\nHowever, when she tried to re-enter the US she was handcuffed and put in a cell before being taken to Tacoma Northwest detention facility in Washington state.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been there for over 10 days now,\u201d Paul Burke said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got any clear timeline for her release. I really can\u2019t understand why someone, a tourist, would be incarcerated and locked up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re living in a nightmare we can\u2019t wake up from,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re having an out-of-body experience. We\u2019re watching ourselves go through the motions of life, but we\u2019re not really doing it, we\u2019re not really there.\u201d\n\nHis daughter wants to leave the country and fly back to the UK, he said, but he feared the immigration crackdown in the US meant there could be a long delay before her case was dealt with.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in this orange prison outfit,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just feels so isolated and desperate, you can imagine, she\u2019s saying, \u2018I want to come home\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe is safe, he said, but living \u201cin horrendous conditions\u201d and had not had access to legal representation. He was taking comfort from the fact that the other women at the facility, many of whom have been incarcerated for months or even years while fighting deportation, had \u201call been really nice to Becky,\u201d Burke said.\n\nBurke said he and his wife, Andrea, had naturally had some worries about their daughter travelling, but thought the US and Canada would be one of the safest places for her to go as a solo traveller, and her plan to stay with host families provided further reassurance.\n\n\u201cThe only thing really we were concerned with, in general, was our little girl was going off for four months as a solo traveller,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe knew for a long time in advance of Trump being inaugurated what his plans were for immigration, but that didn\u2019t enter our minds with respect to Becky,\u201d he added. \u201cShe was going on a four-month backpacking tourist trip. We wouldn\u2019t even think of her as an immigrant.\n\n\u201cWe were horrified about what was planned for immigrants and illegal aliens in the US, just like many people around the world were,\u201d he added. \u201cBut why would we put that together with Becky making this trip? We now know better, because we believe it\u2019s had a direct impact.\u201d\n\nBurke said he wanted to warn other families who may have children travelling to the US. \u201cThe key thing is check and double-check and triple-check the visa requirements, especially if it\u2019s an extended visit like Becky\u2019s was, rather than just a couple of weeks\u2019 holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t want anyone else to go through this.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s local MP Catherine Fookes, the Labour MP for Monmouthshire, said: \u201cI am deeply concerned about my constituent\u2019s welfare and the distress this situation is causing her and her family.\n\n\u201cHer family is desperate to bring her home, and I share their urgency in seeking a resolution.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince being made aware of the case, my team have been in regular contact with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and other relevant authorities to press for urgent action. We have relayed the family\u2019s request for voluntary departure and continue to push for clear answers on the next steps to get her home as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy team and I will continue doing everything in our power to secure a swift resolution and will not stop working until my constituent is safely reunited with her family.\u201d\n\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are supporting a British national detained in the USA and are in contact with the local authorities.\u201d",

Many times over the past few months, I\u2019ve heard the phrase, \u201cWho will pick our crops if undocumented immigrants are sent back to their home countries?\u201d\n\nOld Mission Gazette is Reader Supported.\n\nClick Here to Keep the Gazette Going.\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure there may be some of those folks working on farms throughout the United States, in the case of Old Mission Peninsula farmers, this farm help is done by people \u2014 generally from Mexico \u2014 who are here legally through the H-2A Visa Program. It\u2019s a very regulated and complex program which, in the case of my farmer brothers, Dean Johnson and Ward Johnson, is handled by an H-2A specialist at the local Farm Bureau office.\n\nFarmers must follow specific rules for this program, and can face fines if anything is amiss. It\u2019s also expensive, as the farmers must pay to transport the workers to the United States and back to their home country, pay to house them, pay specific wages and more. Here\u2019s a partial list of costs\u2026\n\nA few costs associated with the H-2A Visa Program for Temporary Farm Workers | Farmers.gov\n\nYou might ask why farmers don\u2019t hire local help to work on the farm. The short answer is, it\u2019s very difficult to find locals willing to do the hard work involved with farming. Back in the 1960s and previous decades, thousands of migrants crowded onto the Peninsula to work on the farms. There was even a Mexican Drive-In Theater at Bowers Harbor that Tim wrote about here.\n\nWhen cherry shakers came along, the crew consisted mainly of family members, kids\u2019 friends, boyfriends, girlfriends and so on. If you were a friend of any of the Johnson kids back then \u2014 or *any OMP farmers\u2019 kids \u2014 chances are good that you worked on the cherry shakers at one time or another.\n\nThen the kids grew up and moved on to other things, and that\u2019s when Mexican workers arrived back on the scene. Most OMP farmers could not run their farms without them, and the H-2A Visa Program is a tremendous help in that regard.\n\nRead more about the program here.\n\nAlso Read\u2026\n\nSUPPORT YOUR INDEPENDENT LOCAL NEWSPAPER: I started Old Mission Gazette in 2015 because I felt a calling to provide the Old Mission Peninsula community with local news. After decades of writing for newspapers and magazines like the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Family Circle and Ladies' Home Journal, I really just wanted to write about my own community where I grew up on a cherry farm and raised my own family. So I started my own newspaper.\n\n\n\nBecause Old Mission Gazette is a \"Reader Supported Newspaper\" -- meaning it exists because of your financial support -- I hope you'll consider tossing a few bucks our way if I mention your event, your business, your organization or your news item, or if you simply love reading about what's happening on the OMP. In a time when local news is becoming a thing of the past, supporting an independent community newspaper is more important now than ever.

            "content": "Introduction\n\nAccording to the Business Formation Statistics for the year 2024, the United States continues to be the pivot of business activity, with millions of businesses operating across the country. As more businesses expand into the country, it is essential for foreign companies to make sure they are compliant with all visa requirements to ensure they can continue operating in the United Staes. For example, if a business intends to expand overseas operations to the United States and wants to transfer an executive or manager from a foreign office to the U.S. entity, they may consider filing for an L-1 \u201cnew Office\u201d visa.\n\nWhat is an L-1 \u2018New Office\u2019 Visa?\n\nThe L-1 \u201cnew office\u201d visa allows businesses to begin their operations in the U.S. by sending their overseas company\u2019s high-level managers or executives through the newly formed U.S. entity. These key personnel can come to the U.S. for an initial period of one year to develop and foster the business\u2019s operations in the new market.\n\nEligibility and Requirements\n\nU.S. immigration regulations define a \u201cnew office\u201d as an organization that has been doing business in the United States through a parent, branch, affiliate or subsidiary for less than one year. Since the new office must conduct business, the mere presence of an agent or office is not sufficient to satisfy the regulations, and it must be shown that the company is engaged in the regular, systematic and continuous provisions of goods and/or services.\n\nThe US company/Petitioner must satisfy following requirements to qualify for a \u201cnew Office\u201d L-1 visa:\n\nThe employer has secured sufficient physical premises to house the new office.\n\nThe employee has been employed as an executive or manager for one continuous year in the three years preceding the filing of the petition with the overseas entity; and\n\nThe intended U.S. office will support an executive or managerial position within one year of the approval of the petition.\n\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(l)(3)(v) for details.\n\nSufficient physical premises\n\nThe U.S. company must secure sufficient physical premises for the new office at the time of filing the Petition with the USCIS. It is also necessary to secure an office space that is large enough to support the U.S. company\u2019s business and planned growth during the first year.\n\nThe petitioner must present evidence proving they have acquired office space that meets all the guidelines. This should include a copy of the signed lease or sale deed to the premises if the U.S. premises are owned or being purchased. Additionally, businesses must submit colored photographs showing the inside and outside of all office space, equipment, merchandise, products, company logos etc. The Petitioner may lease a co-working space, as long as it is sufficient enough to accommodate Petitioner\u2019s to be hired employees for the first year and they have confirmation from the Lessor to make the additional space available to the company as and when needed.\n\nOne Year employment with overseas entity\n\nThe Petitioner must demonstrate that the Beneficiary was employed with its qualifying overseas entity for at least one year in a managerial or executive or specialized knowledge capacity. The overseas entity must be actively doing business for one year or more and should be related to the petitioner in a qualifying relationship as parent-subsidiary or affiliate. The Petitioner must provide sufficient evidence to establish that the Beneficiary is employed with the entity in managerial or executive or specialized knowledge capacity.\n\nThe Petitioner must be able to demonstrate that the Beneficiary will be actively involved in day-to-day operations during the initial phases of the business. It must also be shown that the individual has the authority and plans to hire staff and other managerial freedoms, such as a wide latitude in making decisions about the goals and management of the organization. The Petitioner must establish that it can support the beneficiary in the requisite managerial, executive, or specialized knowledge position within one year of approval. At the time an extension is filed, USCIS will closely scrutinize the petition to determine whether this has occurred, and to verify that the petitioner has followed through with the timetable and plans submitted in the original \u201cnew office\u201d L-1 petition.\n\nBusiness plan, financial projections, and personnel plan\n\nA detailed and extensive business plan is also required with a \u201cnew office\u201d L-1 petition, as USCIS places an emphasis on the company\u2019s short- and long-term goals and projections when adjudicating the initial petition and future extensions.\n\nThe business plan should begin with an explanation supporting the need for the new office in the U.S., which may include a SWOT analysis. It should demonstrate the proposed business actions the Petitioner is planning to execute throughout the first year of its business and thereafter. The Business shall include the Petitioner\u2019s financial projections, hiring, costing, marketing and sales plan. It should also explain how the financial projects were derived and whether the calculations were based on realistic and credible assumptions using current assets, growth revenues, and other similar projection calculation tools.\n\nThe Petitioner\u2019s hiring plan should exhibit the total number of employees the Petitioner intends to hire in the first year and in the upcoming years. It should specifically include the job titles, brief job descriptions, approximate salaries, etc. of all the to be hired positions.\n\nL-1 New Office Period of Stay\n\nThe Beneficiary entering the United States to establish a new office will be allowed a maximum initial stay of one year. For all L-1A employees, requests for extension of stay may be granted in increments of up to an additional two years, until the employee has reached the maximum limit of seven years.\n\nConclusion",

            "content": "The Trump administration has begun cancelling visas retroactively as part of preparations to reinstate a controversial travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries, US sources told The New Arab's Arabic language edition, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed.\n\nAmerican embassies in multiple countries have notified some visa holders - including those already in the United States - that their visas have been revoked. These individuals have been instructed to report to their respective US embassies for further interviews.\n\nThe move is reportedly linked to Donald Trump's upcoming travel ban, which is expected to target citizens from several Muslim-majority countries as soon as next week.\n\nThe decision follows an executive order issued by Trump on 20 January titled \"Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security Threats\".\n\nThe order outlines new security procedures for visa applicants and mandates a review of individuals who entered the United States during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nLibyan students among those affected\n\nSeveral Libyan students who recently obtained US study visas were notified via email that their visas had been cancelled. They were instructed to visit the US embassy in Tunisia - since the US does not have an embassy in Libya - for further interviews, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported, citing a human rights source.\n\nThe source added that the retroactive visa cancellations applied not only to those still outside the United States but also to Libyan students already in the country, effectively nullifying their residency status.\n\nLibya has now been confirmed as one of the countries included in the upcoming travel ban.\n\nTrump's executive order is seen as a renewed attempt to impose a travel ban similar to the one introduced during his first term, which initially targeted citizens from Libya, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia, as well as North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela.\n\nThe new order instructs US authorities to review individuals from these countries who entered the United States since Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January 2021. If authorities find any security concerns or questionable activities, those individuals could face deportation.\n\nThe order also calls for a return to the strict vetting procedures previously enforced during Trump's first term, which Biden later revoked. Trump's policy notably blocked individuals from Muslim-majority countries under the pretext of security concerns.\n\nThe executive order specifically calls for the review of visa holders from countries with what Trump claims are \"lax security screening processes\".\n\nIt insists that the United States must ensure that \"foreign nationals admitted to the US do not harbour hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles\".\n\nImpact on Afghan and Pakistani nationals\n\nThe new ban is expected to introduce three distinct categories:\n\nThe \"Red List\" \u2014 This is expected to include all countries previously subjected to the 2017 ban, plus Afghanistan and possibly Pakistan. The \"Orange List\" \u2014 Citizens from these countries will face stricter visa application processes. Wealthier individuals may be granted visas for business purposes, but immigration and tourist visas will be heavily restricted. The \"Yellow List\" \u2014 Countries on this list will be given 60 days to improve security measures and information-sharing protocols with the U.S. Failure to comply could result in partial or full travel restrictions.\n\nReports indicate that approximately 200,000 Afghan citizens who previously received US approval for refugee or Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) now face uncertainty. Many of these individuals worked alongside US forces during the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIn response, groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) have urged Afghan visa holders currently outside the US to return immediately before the ban is enforced.\n\nCAIR condemned the administration's move, warning that reintroducing a Muslim travel ban would unfairly target individuals who have already passed rigorous security screening procedures.\n\nTrump previously pledged to expand the travel ban during his campaign, vowing to introduce ideological screening to prevent what he described as \"haters, extremists, and lunatics\" from entering the country.\n\nCritics have widely condemned the move as discriminatory and a thinly veiled attempt to target Muslim-majority countries under the guise of national security.",

            "content": "The real estate industry has long benefited from the demand for American citizenship. One of the quickest paths to becoming an American has been the EB-5 program, which many real estate developers have used to attract foreign investors and reduce their cost of capital. Known as the Immigrant Investor Program, the EB-5 visa is granted to foreigners who invest $1,050,000 in a new commercial enterprise (or $800,000 if the investment is made in a Targeted Employment Area). To qualify for the visa, the investment must also create 10 full-time jobs. But, this program is now in jeopardy, as President Trump has announced plans to replace the EB-5 program with a new \u201cGolden Visa.\u201d\n\nThe Golden Visa would differ from the EB-5 in a few key ways. Instead of an investment, it would require a direct payment to the government. It would also grant new citizens important tax advantages, providing an exemption on foreign income rather than requiring them to pay taxes on all global earnings, as is currently mandated for American citizens.\n\nFor the real estate industry, the concern is that ending the EB-5 program would eliminate a valuable source of investment. Real estate developments have been a preferred vehicle for EB-5 investments, as they reliably produce the required jobs, follow a clear timeline for completion, and provide investors with a tangible asset upon completion. EB-5 projects have been highly popular\u2014since its inception in 2008, the New York City Regional Center alone has facilitated over $1.5 billion in capital for various developments.\n\nThe details of the Golden Visa have yet to be finalized, so the EB-5 program could remain even if the new visa is introduced. Notably, President Trump himself has used the EB-5 program to finance a 50-story residential skyscraper in Jersey City. That project, a collaboration between Kushner Companies\u2014managed by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2014and the KABR Group, came under scrutiny for its designation as a Targeted Employment Area.\n\nIf Trump replaces the EB-5 program with the Golden Visa, developers will face even greater challenges in securing investment capital\u2014at a time when real estate debt is already prohibitively expensive for many projects. Proponents hope the Golden Visa will generate enough economic growth to attract new capital and lower interest rates, but that may be optimistic. Fewer than 10,000 people currently participate in the EB-5 program, and that number would likely shrink with a $5 million price tag. If the EB-5 program is eliminated, real estate developers will have to get creative in finding funding with one less tool at their disposal.",

            "content": "Federal immigration authorities arrested a Palestinian graduate student who played a prominent role in protests against Israel at Columbia University, according to his attorney.\n\nMahmoud Khalil was inside a university-owned residence Saturday night near Columbia\u2019s Manhattan campus when several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered his apartment and took him into custody, his attorney, Amy Greer, told The Associated Press.\n\nGreer said she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.\n\nThe arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.\n\nWhen ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.\n\nThey were initially told he was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But when Khalil\u2019s wife tried to visit Sunday, she learned he was not there \u2014 and may have been transferred as far away as Louisiana, Greer said.\n\nStudent Mahmoud Khalil on the Columbia University campus in New York on April 29. Ted Shaffrey / AP\n\n\u201cWe have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,\u201d Greer told the AP. \u201cThis is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to NBC News on Sunday, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Khalil was arrested in coordination with ICE and the State Department \u201cin support of President Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\n\u201cKhalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\u201d McLaughlin said.\n\nA Columbia spokesperson said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property, but declined to say if the school had received one ahead of Khalil\u2019s arrest. The spokesperson also declined to comment on Khalil\u2019s detention.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left Sunday with the State Department and ICE.\n\nIn a message shared on X Sunday evening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration \u201cwill be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d\n\nDHS can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone\u2019s permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.\n\n\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.\n\nKhalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.\n\nHe was also among those under investigation by a new Columbia University office that has brought disciplinary charges against dozens of students for their pro-Palestinian activism, according to records shared with the AP.\n\nThe investigations come as the Trump administration has followed through on its threat to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to Columbia because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school\u2019s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group. He faced sanctions for potentially helping to organize an \u201cunauthorized marching event\u201d in which participants glorified Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and playing a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism, among other acts of alleged discrimination.\n\n\u201cI have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,\u201d Khalil told the AP last week.\n\n\u201cThey just want to show Congress and right-wing politicians that they\u2019re doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.\u201d",

The attorney said Khalil had received a green card after graduating from Columbia in December. An immigration enforcement official told the attorney the State Department had revoked the green card as well. The senior department official confirmed the two revocations.\n\nA public ICE database first listed Khalil as being held in an Elizabeth, N.J., detention center. By Monday morning, it said he had been moved to a facility in Louisiana.\n\n\"This should serve as a warning to foreign students on temporary status in America\u2014under this administration, if you support terror groups, we will deport you,\" the State Department official told the Free Beacon. Rubio issued a similar statement, saying he will \"be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\n\nIt was an apparent reference to a statement from the Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) group Khalil belongs to that endorsed Hamas's \"armed resistance.\"\n\n\"We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance,\" the group wrote on Oct. 8. One day earlier, on the anniversary of Hamas's Oct. 7 , 2023, attack on Israel, CUAD lauded the \"Al-Aqsa Flood\"\u2014Hamas's name for the terror spree\u2014as a \"moral, military and political victory.\"\n\n\"The Palestinian resistance is moving their struggle to a new phase of escalation and it is our duty to meet them there. It is our duty to fight for our freedom!\"\n\nKhalil was one of the CUAD student leaders who organized the encampments. He led negotiations with the school as they unfolded, demanding divestment from Israel. Khalil pledged further unrest in the buildup to the fall semester, telling the Hill he would continue to push Columbia to divest from Israel by \"any available means necessary.\" Video footage placed him at a more recent illegal protest at Barnard College that took place on Wednesday.\n\n\"And we\u2019ve been working all this summer on our plans, on what\u2019s next to pressure Columbia to listen to the students and to decide to be on the right side of history,\" Khalil said in August. \"We\u2019re considering a wide range of actions throughout the semester, encampments and protests and all of that. But for us, encampment is now our new base.\"\n\nKhalil has openly discussed his visa status and his upbringing in Syria, including in an interview with Qatar-funded network Al Jazeera.\n\nColumbia issued a statement on Sunday that did not directly address Khalil's detention and instead referenced \"reports of ICE around campus.\"\n\n\"Consistent with our longstanding practice and the practice of cities and institutions throughout the country, law enforcement must have a judicial warrant to enter non-public University areas, including University buildings,\" the statement read. \"Columbia is committed to complying with all legal obligations and supporting our student body and campus community.\"\n\nThe news comes amid a flurry of actions from the Trump administration to deport pro-Hamas visa holders, something President Donald Trump promised to do on the campaign trail. In his second week in office, Trump signed an executive order instructing federal agencies to investigate and deport anti-Semitic resident aliens, including those on visas, who have violated U.S. law.\n\nThe State Department revoked the visa of a university student for the first time on Thursday, citing the individual\u2019s prior involvement in criminal activity tied to Hamas-supporting campus disruptions. Khalil's arrest came two days later and does not come as a surprise\u2014the encampment negotiator was included on a shortlist of pro-Hamas student visa holders that anti-Semitism watchdog group Betar USA presented to the administration, the Free Beacon reported last month.\n\nOn Friday, meanwhile, Trump\u2019s newly formed task force to combat anti-Semitism announced it had revoked approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia over its failure to curb anti-Semitism in the aftermath of Oct. 7. Columbia\u2019s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, issued a statement that acknowledged Columbia\u2019s \"failures and shortcomings\" and pledged to work with Trump administration officials \"to address their legitimate concerns.\"\n\n\"Columbia is taking the government\u2019s action very seriously. I want to assure the entire Columbia community that we are committed to working with the federal government to address their legitimate concerns,\" Armstrong wrote. \"To that end, Columbia can, and will, continue to take serious action toward combatting antisemitism on our campus.\"\n\nTwo days earlier, Columbia student radicals stormed a Barnard College campus building for the second time in a week. During the first storming, they sent a security guard to the hospital and caused $30,000 in damages. On the second occasion, the agitators distributed Hamas propaganda meant to justify Oct. 7. Within hours of the Trump administration\u2019s funding cut announcement, Columbia suspended its four students who had been arrested while clashing with police during the more recent incident.\n\nThe administration appears likely to pull more taxpayer funds from Columbia. The anti-Semitism task force is actively probing $5 billion worth of Columbia\u2019s grants and contracts over the Ivy League institution\u2019s \"apparent failure\" to protect Jewish students.\n\nUpdate March 10, 9:30 a.m.: This piece has been updated with additional information.",

And it echoes similar \u201cgolden visa\u201d programs in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, Malta and others that have allowed participants to pay a fee or make an investment in order to secure a pathway to residency in desirable places.\n\n\u201cGolden visa\u201d programs all have different frameworks and paths to permanent residency, and they have had mixed results in spurring investment in a country\u2019s economy.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said Trump\u2019s gold card would replace an existing program in two weeks, so details about who would qualify and what the application process would look like should be available before then. For now, all Trump has said is they will cost $5 million.\n\nOf recipients, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ll be wealthy, and they\u2019ll be successful, and they\u2019ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it\u2019s going to be extremely successful.\u201d\n\nHe added that companies, not just individuals, \u201cwill be able to buy gold cards. \u201c\n\nCongress created a program called EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program in 1990 to create jobs and encourage foreign investment. Under that program, investors who spent about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people can qualify for a visa and a pathway to permanent residency.\n\nAbout 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department\u2019s most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.\n\nHenley & Partners, which advises both governments and people on residence or citizenship by investment programs, says more than 100 countries around the world offer or have offered \u201cgolden visas\u201d to wealthy individuals and investors. That list includes the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, although some countries have tightened their restrictions or ended programs.\n\nUnder different programs in different countries, requirements include buying a house, making a financial investment or creating a certain number of jobs.\n\nBasil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner Henley & Partners North America, said the programs often help countries meet investment goals. But they don\u2019t always last.\n\nSpain\u2019s government scrapped its program to allow people from outside the European Union to obtain residency permits if they invested more than half a million euros ($520,000) in real estate. The program was criticized for causing soaring housing prices. The U.K. ended its program in 2022 over security concerns.\n\nMohr-Elzeki said despite the high price tag, there may be an appetite for the program, but it remains to be seen what the parameters are.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that much information aside from the investment threshold and the intention,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do think that there will be significant demand in this program. We are just waiting on the details of what frameworks that they\u2019re going to be outlining.\u201d\n\nThe key to whether it will be a success or not will less likely be the $5 million investment threshold and more to do with the process.\n\n\u201cTypically speaking, the lower the residency requirements, the more popular the program as those wealthy individuals globally, they like options,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, they may be investing in the United States, but they may invest elsewhere as well \u2014 to have access to live in the States, access to live in Europe, access to live in the UAE. So, all of these come into play. \u201c\n\nIf the new program replaces the existing EB-5 program as soon two weeks, there are questions over what will happen to people in the existing program. Typically, those people get grandfathered into the new program, but Mohr-Elzeki said there\u2019s a possibility they might not be.\n\nIn 2022, Congress extended the EB-5 program until 2027, so congressional action would be needed to change it. But Trump has said gold cards won\u2019t require Congressional approval.",

Ivan Vitsyn and his wife Olesia Aladko had been preparing for months for their children to join them in the UK. The family are from the Kharkiv region of eastern Ukraine, close to the Russian border, and had left their seven-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter with Ivan's parents while they found a suitable home for them to live. The parents - who came to the UK in May 2023 as strawberry pickers on seasonal worker visas - had planned to act as sponsors for their children under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people in the UK to host those fleeing the war. Originally living in a caravan, it was several months before they found a family home to rent. But in February last year - without warning - the previous Conservative government changed eligibility rules so only British or Irish citizens or those with the right to live in the UK permanently could act as sponsors. \"We worked so hard to prepare to reunite with the kids and then overnight we were not able to,\" says Ivan, speaking through a translator. \"The dream was shattered to pieces, we didn't know what to do.\" Meanwhile, their children were stuck in Ukraine, living alongside the sounds of explosions, just 50km (31 miles) from the battlefield.\n\nThe pair tried desperately without success to find a British sponsor for their children. Instead they were faced with scammers asking for thousands of pounds in exchange for their help. Eventually they were put in touch with the charity Settled, which provides help to Ukrainians with the visa process. The charity advised applying for a visa naming themselves as sponsors, despite the new rules, in the hope the Home Office would make an exception. But their application was left in limbo, with no decision, so it could not be challenged. \"Every day we checked our email,\" Ivan says, describing the wait as \"painful\".\n\nFamily handout Oleksandra, 10, and Kyrylo, seven, were living with their grandparents in Ukraine\n\nThen in January, the government announced it was reversing the changes brought in under the Conservatives, so Ukrainians could once again sponsor their children to join them in the UK. When Ivan and Olesia received an email confirming their children's visas had been approved they were overjoyed. \"I cannot explain that feeling,\" says Ivan. \"It was the best feeling in the world.\" Settled has supported a number of Ukrainian families like Ivan and Olesia, who are now starting to get their applications approved. But others hoping to bring relatives such as siblings or parents remain separated. Seema Malhotra, minister for migration and citizenship, said: \"Under the previous government, a change was made to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which meant that parents could not sponsor their children to join them in the UK even if they had appropriate accommodation. This was an unacceptable position and it is absolutely right that children should be with their parents. \"I am fully committed to supporting Ukraine in their fight against Putin's illegal war, while also providing a safe and secure haven for those fleeing the conflict.\" Although Ukraine has signalled its willingness to enter peace negotiations, with the US pushing for an end to the war, the UK has given Ukrainians the right to apply to stay in the country for a further 18 months. While Ivan hopes his family can return to Ukraine one day, he adds: \"Even if the war stopped tomorrow there is no certainty for our region.\" For Olesia, having her children with her means she can now start to rebuild their lives in the UK. \"There is probably no other feeling like having your children beside you. You don't worry; you don't start your day by reading the news about what happened in Ukraine, where there were attacks,\" she says. \"You fall asleep peacefully and wake up peacefully because your children are next to you, and nothing else is needed.\"",

            "content": "Trump's Gold Card Visa Program Is Causing Panic In Real Estate Circles. Here's Why\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has put a price on coveted green cards\u2014$5 million. That\u2019s how much he plans to sell the gateway cards to citizenship, which allow U.S. residency and the ability to work and do business in the U.S. However, the proposal, first touted by investment guru Grant Cardone in December, is ringing alarm bells in a sector the president knows well\u2014real estate.\n\nDubbed the \u201cgold card,\u201d Trump\u2019s plan to sell green cards is intended to replace the EB-5 investor visa, which the real estate industry has favored as a way to provide funding for major projects, the New York Times reports. Major developments such as Manhattan's Hudson Yards, the San Francisco Shipyard, and Trump Plaza Residences in Jersey City, N.J., have all received funding from overseas investors via the EB-5 program, which includes U.S. residency, among its perks.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nTrump\u2019s Gold Card Costs 5 Times More Than The EB-5 Visa\n\nThe EB-5 program costs considerably less than Trump\u2019s proposed $5 million gold card. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \u201cfor petitions filed after March 15, 2022, the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 raises the investment amounts to $1,050,000 for standard cases and $800,000 for targeted employment areas.\u201d\n\nWhile the EB-5 program is not a huge moneymaker\u2014 according to the New York Times, it contributes about $5 billion to the $28 trillion U.S. economy \u2014 it is pivotal for a select group of major real estate developers. It dramatically changes the bottom line, turning losses into profits when compared to borrowing more expensive money from domestic lenders.\n\n\u201cCheap capital is the crack cocaine to the real estate industry and probably every other industry,\u201d Matt Gordon, the CEO of E3iG, which advises both foreign investment-based visa applicants and U.S. companies seeking funding, told the Times. \u201cThey and their rather large political donations are going to be very motivated.\u201d\n\nTrending: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\n\nWhy The EB-5 Program Is So Valuable\n\nEstablished in 1990 to help attract investment for rural and economically depressed areas, the EB-5 program\u2019s approval requirements were initially based on the creation of 10 specific new jobs from the business the visa engendered. Over time, that became a gray area, morphing into each investor\u2019s funding, resulting in 10 jobs overall for the economy.",

Both companies are understood to profit from the arrangements, earning a small fee each time a transaction is made.\n\nThe card companies\u2019 links to the unlicensed sites are revealed in the wake of an investigation coordinated by Investigate Europe into a network of gambling sites operating in parts of Europe despite being banned.\n\nOne customer said they were left suicidal after losing about \u00a360,000 unwittingly gambling on an unlicensed site. In another case, a man successfully pursued an operator in the German courts after \u00adlosing more than \u00a3200,000. \u201cThose who run these casinos have stolen my life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nine websites operating in the UK do not hold gambling licences, which are required by law, but appear in search listings and are promoted on social media. The five most popular sites drew about four million UK visits between last October and December.\n\nView image in fullscreen One of the unlicensed sites targeting UK customers. Illustration: Screenshot\n\nThey have been accused of failing to pay winnings and spamming problem gamblers. FatPirate, which advertises a welcome bonus of up to \u00a3425, has been the subject of several complaints that it prevented users from withdrawing money they had won. One UK customer claimed they had won \u00a36,000 after spending \u00a33,270 with their bank card but were unable to withdraw it.\n\nA customer of another of the unlicensed sites, Gransino, claimed their account had been deleted after they complained about being unable to withdraw winnings. When they contacted support they were told that it was the end of the matter. \u201cThey take your money and never pay out,\u201d they said, adding that they were \u201cdevastated\u201d. Both of the sites were offering Mastercard payment last week.\n\nThe operators of the websites, based overseas, did not respond to requests for comment. Mastercard and Visa said they prohibited illegal activity on their networks and would investigate. The Gambling Commission, which regulates gambling in Great Britain, said it was aware of the sites and would \u201ccontinue to take action against them\u201d.\n\nThe findings raise questions about the role of the payment giants in facilitating unlicensed gambling transactions \u2013 and about the apparent failure of regulators to tackle the sites in the first place.\n\nThe Gambling Commission is understood to have received complaints about at least five of the nine websites identified in the analysis. But they remained accessible last week \u2013 accepting card payments from UK customers and offering deals in sterling, including welcome bonuses of up to \u00a31,800 and hundreds of free spins.\n\nView image in fullscreen Iain Duncan Smith, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling reform, said: \u2018These companies must immediately up their game.\u2019 Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nMastercard and Visa had agreed to block payments linked to unlicensed operators, entering into a voluntary arrangement alongside PayPal with the Gambling Commission in 2014. The companies are legally obliged to take steps to prevent the use of their networks for criminal activity. But the Observer found them facilitating payments for illicit websites with high traffic, which in some cases have been publicly linked to alleged scams, raising questions about the robustness of their due diligence.\n\nSeparately, records of complaints to the gambling watchdog reveal the scale of the illicit market in Britain \u2013 there were at least 922 complaints about unlicensed operators in the two years to December, according to documents obtained by Investigate Europe under freedom of information laws. Several complaints mention Mastercard and Visa by name. One person indicated that they had won about \u00a370,000 on an unlicensed gambling site, which allowed transactions with Mastercard but were only able to withdraw a fraction of that.\n\nIain Duncan Smith, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling reform, said the findings were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. The former Conservative leader said that while most online gambling harm was caused by licensed firms, regulators \u201cmust do more to clamp down on abuses by unlicensed operators\u201d.\n\nHe said Mastercard and Visa risked lending unregulated sites credibility. \u201cThese companies must immediately up their game and start blocking all unlicensed gambling site transactions,\u201d he said.\n\nMastercard said it had \u201czero tolerance for illegal activity\u201d on its network and that when issues were identified, it investigated them so it could \u201cwork with partners to take the appropriate action\u201d. \u201cWe will now do that with the sites you noted,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nView image in fullscreen WildRobin, an unlicensed gambling site, offering UK customers the chance to pay by Visa or Mastercard. Illustration: Screenshot\n\nThe company said it did not have a direct relationship with the gambling sites and that it was down to banks to ensure that merchants were acting lawfully and in line with Mastercard\u2019s rules. Neither it nor Visa commented on the previous agreement with the Gambling Commission to block unlicensed gambling transactions.\n\nVisa said illegal activity on its network was \u201cexplicitly and unequivocally\u201d prohibited. \u201cWe take this very seriously and investigate all reports of illegal activity,\u201d a spokesperson said, adding that the company has \u201cno direct relationship with merchants\u201d but works with partners to terminate those selling illegal services, and \u201cconstantly invests\u201d in \u201cbest-in-class technology\u201d to enforce compliance.\n\nDuring the Observer\u2019s testing, the payments were made via a payment tool called PaymentIQ embedded in the gambling websites. The \u201cpayment orchestration\u201d tool is widely used by businesses in high-risk sectors to route transactions via different financial institutions, maximising the chance of them being approved.\n\nFrench payment services company Worldline, which owns PaymentIQ, said it was a \u201cneutral\u201d software solution that did not control customer funds or process payments. \u201cPaymentIQ has no responsibility for ensuring that scheme rules and the acquiring partners of the merchant fulfil their obligations,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nProfessor Heather Wardle, an expert in gambling harms at the University of Glasgow, said the findings were evidence of the \u201cwide and complex commercial ecosystem\u201d underpinning unlicensed gambling. She said \u201cevery actor\u201d in the chain should be accountable. \u201cThey should not be complacent about how their actions enable these harms,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Gambling Commission said it was working hard to disrupt the unlicensed market, including issuing \u201cover 770 cease and desist notices\u201d and referring more than 100,000 URLs to Google for removal in the past 11 months. Chief executive Andrew Rhodes has previously cited \u201cphoenixing\u201d as a key challenge for the watchdog \u2013 where duplicate websites are created after illegal ones are taken down.\n\nA spokesperson said customers could easily check if sites were licensed by searching its website, adding that those gambling on unlicensed ones were \u201cputting themselves at risk\u201d. \u201cYour financial data could be stolen, harvested or misused and you may not even be paid out if you win,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Betting & Gaming Council, an industry lobby group representing licensed operators, says gamblers in Great Britain spend more than \u00a32.7bn on unlicensed sites each year. It said the \u201cillegal and growing gambling black market\u201d posed a \u201csignificant threat\u201d.",

            "content": "Live Events\n\nRich Indians are scrambling for EB5 visas to the US after President Trump floated the Gold Card balloon for immigrants for $5 million which is 6.5 times costlier than the $ 800,000 EB5 visa that grants permanent resident rights for recipients.\u201cWe are experiencing a surge in interest for the EB-5 visa petition. Our office is inundated with inquiries, and many clients are eager to file their I-526E petitions promptly to secure their EB-5 applications before any potential changes to the current law,\u201d Sukanya Raman, country head for India at Davies and Associates LLC, told ET.There is no clarity on whether the Trump Gold Card would replace the existing EB-5 visa programme, and given how quickly policies are chopped and changed in Trump\u2019s second presidency, many fear the window is too slim. Clients initially planning to apply for the EB-5 visa are now accelerating the processing of their applications, experts said.\u201cThis is a great option instead of sinking $5 million as Trump has said that he will \u201csell\u201d the Gold Card and has not said that the Gold Card will be granted for an investment of $ 5 million,\u201d said Poorvi Chothani, managing partner, LawQuest.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)The Gold Card programme so far has only been a trial balloon and there are no details as to when it might come into effect and the requirements to qualify.Any changes to the current immigration programmes will need an act of parliament to take effect, said another expert.The EB-5 immigrant investor programme requires foreign nationals to invest in US businesses and create at least 10 full-time jobs per investor.As of today, the EB-5 programme is a guaranteed and existing pathway with established legal backing, said Alex Jovy, Immigration Advisor at Davies and Associates. The EB-5 leads directly to a Green Card and eventually US citizenship after five years.The Gold Card program is primarily targeted at UHNI and investors, rather than entry-level or mid-career professionals, including skilled workers from India.Given the $5 million price tag, it is highly unlikely that US companies would invest such a substantial amount to hire individual talent through this route, experts said.Accessibility to Trump\u2019s Gold Card programme is limited to the ultra-wealthy, and its long-term viability depends on corporate adoption and legal challenges.\u201cIt can be perceived as selling US citizenship to the highest bidder, raising ethical concerns,\u201d said Alay Razvi, managing partner, Accord Juris.There is no assurance that firms will be willing to spend $5 million per candidate, especially when existing visa programmes are cheaper, said Razvi.Others like Rajiv Khanna, managing attorney, Immigration.com, are awaiting the details of the proposed programme. \u201cI\u2019m unsure about the paying capacity of the people who will participate in this programme,\u201d he said.But certainly, the Gold Card programme is not meant to help Indian students due to its high investment, said experts.",

            "content": "(NYT photo)\n\nThe TOI Correspondent from Washington:\n\nStudents from India typically embrace a lifestyle in US that is said to revolve around \"apartment and department.\" Older graduate students may be a little more adventurous, shuttling between \"Advisor and Budweiser.\" The rare ones who are audacious enough to dabble in political activism got a salutary warning this week with the Trump administration revoking the student visa of a Chinese scholar in California for participating in pro-Palestinian rallies on the campus.The State Department did not name the student but social media posts identified her as Liu Lijun, a grad student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Liu came to prominence after her arrest in May 2024 following campus unrest tied to the Israel-Hamas war after the Palestinian extremist group attacked Israel. While some reports characterized her as an organizer leading the protests against Israel's retaliation, others said she was only a participant whose arrest pitched her into the limelight.Speculation about foreign student visa revocations has been in the air for weeks after President Trump signed an executive order on January 29 aimed at combating what the administration described as rising antisemitism and harassment of Jewish students on college campuses. The order specifically targeted international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, authorizing the Departments of Education, State, and Homeland Security to monitor and report activities by foreign students and staff that could lead to investigations and, if warranted, visa revocations or deportations.Liu Lijun's visa revocation is said to be the first of its kind in recent times and comes on the heels of the Trump administration canning $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University for failing to fight anti-semitism on campus. Nine other universities, including George Washington University; Harvard University; Johns Hopkins University; New York University; Northwestern University; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California, are under scrutiny, with Justice Department officials visiting them to look into political activism by foreign students, which more extreme MAGA elements characterize as support for terrorists.Thousands of students from India are studying at these campuses, all located in Democrat-run states and liberal enclaves in the US. India is now the leading country of origin for international students in the U.S., with 331,602 Indian students enrolled in American higher education institutions, a 23% increase from the prior year when China was the top country.Trump himself has railed against \"woke\" and 'liberal\" activism on campuses, which he says are dominated by the \"radical left\" or \"Marxist\" influences that prioritize gender identity discussions and critical race theory at the expense of traditional American principles. After he delivered a $ 400million blow to Columbia this week, the White House trolled the university, posting a photo of Trump with the message \"Shalom Columbia!\"Most universities, including Columbia, are quickly falling in line even as civil liberties activists are raging about the war on free speech and peaceful protests which have long been the hallmark of American campuses. But MAGA hardliners argue that right cannot be exercised by foreign students, least of all those from China, whose government would not allow protests by its own citizens.Not everyone is convinced about the Trump dispensation's stance on anti-semitism though. \"Revoking federal grants to Columbia University isn\u2019t about combating anti-Semitism; it\u2019s about the Trump administration\u2019s war on education and science. If the Trump administration were as serious about anti-Semitism ... they would not have filled their ranks with unapologetic antisemites,\" Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler said.\"Today's announcement does nothing to keep Jewish students safe and sends a chilling message that universities must align with the MAGA agenda or face financial ruin,\" he added.",

This new system will come into effect in April 2025.\n\nWhile commenting on the Gold Visa Scheme, Trump said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be selling a gold card. You have a green card, this is a gold card. We\u2019re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million,\u201d\n\nThe US President said that the \u201cgold card\u201d would grant all facilities provided by the Green card, while also being a \u201croute\u201d to US citizenship.\n\nGold Visas offered by UAE and European nations\n\nThis will replace the currently EB 5 visa program \u2013 under which foreigners who invest $1 million in the US are granted a conditional residency visa. Several European countries have been providing long-term residency visas \u2013 by investment \u2013 which are referred to as \u2018Gold Visas\u2019. Due to growing resentment by locals against the Gold Visas, some European countries have discontinued the program while others have significantly revised their programs. The reasons for European nations either discontinuing or making the conditions more stringent is the misuse of the visa in several cases and the rising house prices in these countries which have resulted in growing resentment among local populations as a result.\n\nOne of the countries which has been offering long term residency visas \u2014 via investment \u2013 referred to the Golden Visa is the UAE. This allows eligible individuals to live in the UAE for up to 10 years.\n\nThe Gulf nation has expanded the Golden Visa to include other categories beyond entrepreneurs \u2013 such as professionals, researchers, and even talented students. Only recently, the UAE included content creators in the Golden Visa category. The UAE also has a Green Visa which is specifically meant for self employed individuals, freelancers or individuals with specific skills.\n\nBeyond HNI\u2019s\n\nWhile High Net-worth Individuals (HNI\u2019s) can avail of these long-term residencies by investment, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is the impact which Trump Administration\u2019s tough stance on immigration have on international students coming to the US \u2013 especially those from countries like India. During his election campaign, Trump had even proposed granting a green card to students enrolled in US universities. Said Trump:\n\n\u201cIf you graduate from a US college, you should automatically get a Green Card as part of your diploma\u201d\n\nWill the US remain the preferred destination for Indian students?\n\nIf one were to look at the instance of India, while the US is likely to remain a preferred destination for Indian students pursuing Engineering and subjects such as data science and bio-technology, prospective students are also mindful of the fact that tougher migration policies could reduce employment opportunities. Trump has reiterated the point, that he is not averse to attracting individuals with skills and talent. Trump also said that the Gold Card can be used by US companies for hiring individuals with skills. Head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk has repeatedly pitched for reforms in the H-1B visa program so that it is easier for US tech companies to hire global talent.\n\nThe US has remained an attractive destination for Indian students, due to the employment opportunities in the country. In 2023-2024, over 300,000 (3,31,600) Indian students have enrolled for the 2023-24 academic year. It remains to be seen whether Trump will introduce significant changes to the existing student visa regime or the Optional Practical Training (OPT) and Curriculum Practical training (CPT). The Trump administration has signalled that it will act against institutions which have misused these provisions and individuals have been working illegally.\n\nAlternatives to the US\n\nUnlike Trump\u2019s earlier presidency, other countries in the Anglosphere \u2014 Australia, Canada and UK \u2014 which were an attractive alternative to the US for international students have adopted tougher migration policies and have also made significant changes to the existing student visa regime with the aim of checking inflow of international students. In such a situation, students can explore opportunities in European nations as well as non-western countries. Already, there has been a rise in Indian students enrolling in institutions in universities in Germany and Finland. The number of Indian students enrolled in German Universities has doubled between 2019 and 2024 and there has been an increase in the number of Indian students enrolled in universities in Finland.\n\nStudents and professionals could also explore opportunities in Non-Western countries. While the UAE has expanded the Gold Visa, as mentioned earlier, other Asian countries are also trying to attract talent. UAE is an especially attractive destination given its proximity to India. While the Gulf nation has emerged as a coveted destination for HNI\u2019s and Indian professionals in recent years, there is scope for the country to attract more Indian students. Apart from its proximity and connectivity with India, which has been mentioned earlier, one of the major advantages which UAE has is that it is home to overseas campuses of western and Australian universities. Indian students can avail of this advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, while Indian students and professionals would be closely watching the Trump administration\u2019s stance on important immigration issues, the US needs individuals with talent and skills and the approach towards student and work visas can not be driven by rhetoric in the long run. At the same time, it is important to look at the alternatives available for education and work opportunities in countries which have not been the preferred choices hitherto.",

            "content": "On February 18, 2025, the US Department of State announced a new policy requiring more foreign nationals to attend in-person interviews to apply for nonimmigrant visas.\n\nThe announcement rolls back a Biden Administration policy which had allowed visa applicants to qualify for the interview waiver program\u2014and thus bypass the in-person interview requirement\u2014if they (a) had been issued a nonimmigrant visa in any classification (except the B visitor visa category), and (b) were applying within 48 months of their most recent visa expiration date.\n\nUnder the new policy, applicants must be applying to renew a visa (a) in the same nonimmigrant classification, and (b) within 12 months of the visa\u2019s expiry. The State Department\u2019s updated policy follows President Donald Trump\u2019s issuance of Executive Order 14161, which called on agencies to implement enhanced vetting procedures for visa applicants.\n\nAppointment Backlogs During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nWhen applying for nonimmigrant visa stamps at US embassies or consulates, applicants have historically been required to appear in person for interviews with consular officers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions and resource limitations led to lengthy wait times for visa appointments at many US consular sections around the world. This situation continued even as pandemic travel restrictions eased, causing wait times of more than a year in some countries.\n\nIn an effort to reduce appointment wait times, the Biden Administration expanded the pool of visa applicants eligible to forgo a consular interview in favor of \u201cdropping off\u201d their visa application for processing. This process, often called a \u201cdropbox\u201d option, allows eligible visa applicants to submit their visa application at a designated location abroad. Consular officers then review the application and may issue a visa without an interview with the applicant. This policy is intended to (1) streamline visa processing for low-risk applicants and reduce wait times for visa appointments, and (2) benefit consular officers by allowing them to allocate more time and resources to complex, high-risk, or sensitive visa cases that require additional scrutiny.\n\nEnhanced Vetting of Visa Applicants\n\nUnder President Trump, the United States has set a policy of enhanced vetting and screening of all foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States, including in employment-based categories such as the H-1B, L-1A, or L-1B. As a result, the eligibility criteria for the visa interview waiver program have been narrowed. Per the State Department\u2019s announcement, applicants are eligible for a waiver of the in-person interview if they previously held a visa in the same category that expired less than 12 months prior to the new application.\n\nAdditionally, to be eligible for an interview waiver, applicants must:\n\nBe applying in their country of nationality or residence;\n\nHave never been refused a visa (unless such refusal was overcome or waived); and\n\nHave no apparent or potential ineligibility.\n\nConsular officers may still require in-person visa interviews on a case-by-case basis, or based on local conditions in the application country. For the most up-to-date eligibility requirements for the interview waiver program, applicants should consult the webpage for the specific US embassy or consulate at which they will submit their visa applications.\n\nWhat This Means for Employers\n\nGiven the State Department\u2019s narrowing of the eligibility criteria for the interview waiver program, employers should expect longer wait times for their employees required to attend in-person visa appointments at US embassies and consulates. Advance planning and flexibility are key\u2014employees should plan and schedule visa appointments as early as possible to minimize potential gaps in travel authorization to the United States.\n\nBeyond wait times for appointments, employees and their employers should be prepared for longer processing times of visa applications after they are submitted to the US consular section, including increased usage of administrative processing by consular officials. Employees who qualify for the interview waiver program should also be prepared for longer processing times, as \"dropbox\" applications are similarly expected to undergo enhanced vetting and screening.\n\nIn recent years, the State Department has posted estimated visa appointment wait times at US embassies and consulates around the globe. However, as of this writing, the posted wait times have not been updated since January 7, 2025.\n\nHow Mayer Brown Can Help\n\nMayer Brown advises employers on navigating the complexities of the visa application process, including proper timing and procedures for visa stamping to enable foreign national employees to work in the United States or travel internationally during their US assignments. Mayer Brown works with consular posts on behalf of client visa applicants to request emergency or expedited processing of visa applications in appropriate circumstances.\n\nEmployers should continue to monitor Mayer Brown\u2019s Washington Update page for legal analysis on policy changes under the current Administration that may impact their workforce. Mayer Brown is poised to help employers understand changing regulatory and policy requirements and develop strategies for mitigating risk, safeguarding compliance, and realizing the full potential of their global talent base.",

This in turn leads to the question of whether foreign students who have already been admitted can have their visas revoked (or not renewed) for supporting Hamas while in the US, as the Trump administration has announced plans to do. This question was the subject of Eugene's very interesting post yesterday about the ACLU's letter on the matter.\n\nOne thing that occurred to me is that it's clear that visas *can* be revoked for actions that involve the exercise of constitutional rights, for which Americans could not be punished. While the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on economic rights is quite forgiving of government regulation, assumedly the Court would not permit the government to enforce a law prohibiting university students from working in any off-campus job without special authorization. And yet, the US government does enforce such a rule against foreign students, and also limits them to working on-campus twenty hours a week while school is in session. So while this in itself does not resolve the First Amendment issue regarding supporting Hamas, it does show that foreign visa holders can have their visa status revoked for engaging in activities for which Americans could not be punished.\n\nAs an aside, it's worth noting that the ACLU's letter attempts to obscure this distinction by referring to foreigners lawfully present in the US on students visas as \"immigrant students.\" They are not, in fact, \"immigrants\" are not here on immigrant visas, and while many (but hardly all) foreign students find a way to stay in the US, student visas are not intended to provide a means of permanent immigration to the US.\n\nOn another point, I disagree with Eugene (rare for me) that deporting Hamas supporters is bad policy \"because chilling the speech of lawful visitors to the U.S. does interfere with the marketplace of ideas for Americans.\" Foreign students are here as visitors to study, not to be members of the American polity. That doesn't mean that we should prohibit them from expressing their opinions, but, e.g., holding protests in favor of an enemy country during wartime, or, more controversially perhaps, prohibiting foreign students from using their status as such to try to influence American public opinion on behalf of organizations that Congress has sanctioned as enemy terrorist organizations, strikes me as perfectly reasonable.",

We have therefore requested the court to review, and ultimately overturn the PSR\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nVisa said in the report: \u201cWe respect the PSR\u2019s role as an economic regulator.

This is critical to future growth and investment in the U.K.\u201d\n\nWhen the PSR announced its proposal to cap interchange fees on cross-border online payments, it said that after the U.K. left the European Union, both Visa and Mastercard raised interchange fees for online transactions between the EU and the U.K. to 1.15% for debit cards and 1.5% for credit cards, saying the hike was needed to contend with fraud and increased competition.\n\n\u201cIn this market review we have provisionally found that the fees charged by Mastercard and Visa to U.K. businesses which accept payments from within the EEA are likely too high,\u201d Chris Hemsley, who was the PSR\u2019s managing director at the time, said in a Dec. 13, 2023, press release. \u201cIn short, at this stage, we do not think this market is working well.\u201d\n\nA Mastercard spokesperson provided a statement at the time saying the company did not agree with the PSR\u2019s conclusions, and would \u201ccontinue to educate them\u201d on the importance of electronic payments to England\u2019s economy.\n\nVisa also disputed the PSR\u2019s findings, saying in a statement provided to PYMNTS: \u201cAccepting reliable, secure and innovative digital payments represents enormous value to U.K. businesses, especially when selling overseas.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s FT report said the legal challenges came at a time when the PSR is being pressured by the government\u2019s efforts to cut red tape and boost growth.",

            "content": "In this land of opportunities, being an immigrant can often feel like playing a round of Twister. A certain contortion of mind, language, and will power seems written into the script; a lot of territory remains untouchable.\n\nShubha Sunder\u2019s debut novel Optional Practical Training is named after the year-long uncertain space of temporary employment in the U.S., which international students can apply for upon completing their American degree. Sunder is a writer and teacher based in Massachusetts, author of the debut short story collection, Boomtown Girl. Like her, the protagonist and narrator of her novel moved to the U.S. for college from Bangalore, India, and she has just moved to Boston to teach maths and science at a private high school as part of her OPT. She is also an aspiring writer.\n\nAs Pavitra navigates her OPT year in Boston, a year shaped by cultural dissonances, we enter spaces of immigrant life that carry a quiet resonance for those in the know. The conversations in and out of classrooms, of workspaces. The precarious stability offered by a visa status. I spoke to Shubha Sunder about writing a novel that takes place within a year and the liminal space of being on a temporary visa.\n\nSarah Anjum Bari: Let\u2019s talk about the title. How does Pavitra\u2019s OPT status frame the story?\n\nShubha Sunder: The thing about OPT is that it\u2019s such a liminal status. It lasts one year but I think it can be renewed in some cases to two, but then that\u2019s it. After that you either go home or you have to have a different visa and be categorized as a different kind of \u201calien\u201d. That made me realize that the whole novel has to take place within a year. She really can\u2019t count on anything. She doesn\u2019t have furniture, that\u2019s why she needs a furnished apartment, but she\u2019s not going to buy furniture because she doesn\u2019t know for sure if she\u2019s going to be able to stay for more than a year. The title, it\u2019s so bureaucratic. The acronym is very important. It\u2019s kind of like a dog whistle\u2014everyone who\u2019s been a foreign student in the U.S. will know immediately what this title refers to, but if you weren\u2019t a foreign student in the US there\u2019s no reason for you to know what Optional Practical Training is. That\u2019s why the letters O-P-T are highlighted [on the book cover]. So it\u2019s just weird and interesting I hope. Optional Practical Training [represents] the shock of arrival, it\u2019s the cold plunge when the immigrant is dropped into the host culture and has to fend for themselves.\n\nSAB: How did Pavitra\u2014or this story\u2014come to you?\n\nSS: For a long time I had this idea of writing my first immigrant novel, because Boomtown Girl, my book of short stories, was set in Bangalore. And then during the thick of Covid lockdown, this is spring of 2020, I was in a place in my personal life where I had been dragged low. My marriage had fallen apart, my soon\u2013to-be ex husband and I were figuring out how to co-parent our one-year-old. I was moving from our two bedroom condo into this tiny apartment. It was a state of mind that [felt like] rock bottom. I felt that if I\u2019m going to make a contribution with my writing, it has to be right now. And so being in that one room apartment took me back to my first year in Boston, which was my first year out of college.\n\nOPT is such a liminal status\u2026 That made me realize that the whole novel has to take place within a year\n\nI started writing this scene which became the first chapter of the book, where this young woman is trying to find a place to live. That has to be the first thing she does when she gets to this city that\u2019s foreseeably going to be her home for the next year. I just wrote down whatever came. I put it away, didn\u2019t look at it for a while and then I did again, and I was like, Oh, it\u2019s written in first person, but she\u2019s not the one who is doing most of the talking. The landlord and other people are talking to her, about her. This is interesting because this is an immigrant story but it\u2019s not so much an immigrant telling their story, as it is a story of America being reflected in the things Americans tell this young woman. She\u2019s very young\u2014old enough to be independent but she\u2019s impressionable, at 22\u2014and the things that people say to and about her are really going to form her sense of identity in this new context. And they also reflect back on who America is.\n\nOnce I figured that out, everything followed from there. I was able to draw from basic facts about what would happen during this year in this person\u2019s life\u2014it\u2019s the nature of the diaspora, right? She\u2019s not going to be the first Indian person in Boston by any means. So there\u2019s going to be someone there before her, who\u2019s going to make contact, so that prompted the chapter with the reunion with the childhood friend. And then of course someone else is going to follow and look to Pavitra for advice. That\u2019s the scene [with her younger cousin visiting Boston from India]. So I had these two reunions which made for an interesting tension [between] someone who had a very thorough set of reasons for why he was going to stay in America, and someone else, the cousin, who has an equally thoroughly constructed argument for why she\u2019s going to go back to India. There\u2019s a moral aspect in each of their arguments\u2014it\u2019s the right thing to stay, it\u2019s the right thing to go back. That\u2019s one layer.\n\nThe other layer is that we have Pavitra, who\u2019s taking all this in. So how are these conversations going to inform who she\u2019s going to become and what she\u2019s going to do?\n\nSAB: That\u2019s what struck me about this book. This form of a novel-in-voices. But we very rarely hear from the narrator, and we get brief outward demonstrations of her character. Is Pavitra really this quiet, demure person, or is the silence a device through which we understand her experience as an immigrant in America? What role is silence playing in this story?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a chatterbox. I think the book demonstrates ways in which she\u2019s outgoing. She takes the initiative to meet people, like the guy downstairs who becomes a love interest. You can\u2019t be a quiet person and be a teacher. But I see this very much as a narrative that\u2019s retrospective\u2014it\u2019s written in past tense. It\u2019s a story told by someone who has been in the United States for a while. She\u2019s rooted when she\u2019s telling the story, she\u2019s tracing back the origins of her life in the U.S. Her personality comes through in the details that she remembers. How she describes the things that people tell her. It\u2019s how my memory works as well. I don\u2019t so much remember things I\u2019ve said, but I do remember things said to me. That\u2019s how the novel operates.\n\nSAB: How did you invent and characterize these other voices propelling the novel?\n\nSS: I was conscious of how characters operate in relation to one another even when they haven\u2019t met each other. I wanted to have conflicting, diverse perspectives. So in early drafts there were characters and conversations that I later eliminated because they were doing things that had already been done. Each conversation maps onto one character, and I wanted each one to be distinct. To be painting a different face of this prism, ultimately, that we see the novel and Pavitra through.\n\nSome rules I set for myself were that nobody gets a free pass, including Pavitra. When something happens again and again in the book, people\u2019s prejudices and biases get revealed. And so do her own. She says cringeworthy things too, and she makes her own assumptions and judgments about America that are not necessarily true or well thought out. I had some conversations with my editor about how far in the direction of caricature I wanted to take the characters. For example, the HR woman, Lila, who appears now and then to handle the OPT paperwork for Pavitra. She is almost borderline ridiculous. But the landlord, who we see is as \u201cAmerican\u201d as Lila, is way more nuanced and complicated. He reveals himself to have all these layers.\n\nSAB: In response to a friend arguing that writers should cater to the familiar territories of their reader, Pavitra reflects that, \u201cPeople in India grow up reading books by English, European, and American writers, writers who\u2019d never considered it their job to help little brown children in the tropics understand cold, white, Western worlds, yet we read them without complaining, with joy even.\u201d Microaggressions, cultural stereotyping and misunderstandings are things she faces frequently throughout the book. Another scene that stayed with me is when Pedro, the guy from downstairs, and Pavitra go to the Zakir Hussain concert. The audience is late, they continue to talk during the performance, and Pedro is offended on behalf of the Indian classical musician. But Pavitra\u2019s point of view reveals how this way of attending an event is rooted in its own historical and social culture. How would you say this novel is engaging with such conversations on navigating unfamiliar cultural spaces?\n\nSS: Something I\u2019ve always been attuned to is the earnestness with which people feel the need to state their values. People really want to be seen as unprejudiced, as having the right views on race, gender, class. You know, when a character states their opinions and then says something that\u2019s directly in contradiction? The vegan poet towards the end of the book? That was one that I let myself have fun with more so than the other characters. I just love how he says, I\u2019m not one of those vegans who goes around telling everyone why it is important to be vegan, and then he goes on to do exactly that. It\u2019s just human nature, it\u2019s who we are. But I find it specific to certain so-called liberal, progressive, East Coast and New England spaces that I\u2019ve been in. I\u2019ve witnessed these kinds of contradictions. This earnestness to believe and see the world a certain way, but not being able to quite do it. You see how it\u2019s gotten us into this political mess, because I think at some level these declarations have a falseness about them.\n\nAs for Pavitra\u2014she can speak English, she\u2019s been in the US for 4 years on a college campus, so she\u2019s not completely a fish out of water. But she\u2019s about to truly discover the depths of the differences between the world that she\u2019s been raised in and the world that she\u2019s in now. When we go to a new place, we make judgments on the place based on what we\u2019re told by locals and by people who\u2019ve been there before. The things we\u2019re told as the foreigner then inform how we proceed to be in that culture. There\u2019s lots of opportunity for misunderstandings, for gaffes, unintentional insults, and making assumptions that are inaccurate. That\u2019s the territory I find really interesting as a foreigner and a writer.\n\nSAB: Could you talk about one of the major themes outlined in Pavitra\u2019s experiences\u2014the idea of teaching as a performance, and the different teaching styles your characters project based on the learning environments they themselves experienced?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve been a teacher now for close to 25 years. I did my MFA and switched to teaching creative writing. It\u2019s been interesting to look back at the ways I\u2019ve had to mould my teaching self to do the job well. Growing up in India, the classroom is not a place of enjoyment necessarily. You don\u2019t go there to be entertained. But I think to some degree that is an expectation here. People think they\u2019re going to college for an experience. Boredom is not something that\u2019s considered okay. I\u2019ve had to be conscious of that as a teacher myself. This whole notion of whether education is something that you pay for, an entitlement, is a big question and one that I think about a lot. If the student is a paying customer, it puts you in an awkward position because you can pay for services\u2014for beautiful lectures, for a stimulating classroom environment, one on one time\u2014but you can\u2019t pay for an \u2018A\u2019. That\u2019s where the waters get muddied. Education is an entitlement that society provides with the view of turning out an educated citizenry, someone says that in the book too. I think a lot about how these two things are at odds. And I think this makes teachers quite stressed out. You can see that in the U.S. on college campuses, public and private schools. Responsibilities and expectations get heaped on teachers as a result of things in society that are way beyond their control.\n\nSo these conversations around teachers, with colleagues and students, certainly those are inspired by conversations that I\u2019ve been a part of.\n\nSAB: This book is coming out at an especially precarious time in American politics. Trump\u2019s inauguration may bring a particular set of difficulties for current and aspiring immigrants. What kind of response or effect are you anticipating this novel to have in this climate?\n\nSS: What I find interesting is that when I was an international student\u2014this was post-9/11\u2014certainly there was this closing off that was happening because of fear. Fear of the outsider, then it was fear of terrorism, and now it seems a broad fear and loathing of foreigners and immigrants in general. What I find striking is how privileged Pavitra\u2019s situation is from our present-day perspective. As an international student, she wasn\u2019t being advised to get back to campus before Inauguration Day because there\u2019s no way to trust that this new administration, one that openly flaunts its xenophobic credentials, is going to let her back in. Immigration has always been a fraught and integral part of America\u2019s identity, so I don\u2019t think there would ever be a bad time to write an immigrant novel. In general, I hope the book takes the reader to a place outside of the tired language of political rhetoric, one that\u2019s more \u201creal\u201d and, for lack of a better word, more nuanced.",

            "content": "On a mantelpiece behind President Donald Trump\u2019s desk in the Oval Office, beside an ornament of Abraham Lincoln and below the draped stars and stripes of the U.S. flag, sits a replica of the FIFA World Cup trophy.\n\nSince taking office in January for his second term, President Trump has repeatedly namechecked the major sporting events due to be hosted in the United States during his presidency, specifically the men\u2019s World Cup in 2026, which will be shared with Canada and Mexico. The Olympic Games will take place in Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has also reminded everyone that he was president in 2018 when the 2026 tournament was awarded and the U.S. secured 75 per cent of the matches. Trump\u2019s administration had a role in the bidding and lobbying process. Most significantly, in a letter dated May 2, 2018, first reported on by The New York Times and subsequently referred to in FIFA\u2019s bid evaluation report, Trump wrote to FIFA president Gianni Infantino and said he was confident that \u201call eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination\u201d during the tournament.\n\nNow, however, just over 15 months out from the opening fixture of the World Cup, multiple sources within the U.S. Department of State (which oversees international relations) believe this commitment is at significant risk of being unfulfilled. There are also widespread fears that a \u201cnon-insignificant\u201d number of people who legitimately acquire tickets for the tournament will be refused visas altogether. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nAs part of The Athletic\u2019s reporting, it was also found that:\n\nWith the World Cup now 468 days away, official government data on wait times for visa interviews at U.S. embassies are as high as 700 days in Colombia, 560 days in Turkey, and 332 days in Morocco.\n\nState Department employees told The Athletic they are concerned that government cuts being undertaken by tech billionaire Elon Musk, in his role heading up the Department of Government Efficiency, as well as anti-immigration policies by Trump\u2019s administration, may have the consequence of worsening wait times and acceptance rates for traveling World Cup fans who require a visa.\n\nThere are fears within the State Department that travel bans will be applied or threatened by the Trump administration against people from countries whose teams may be competing in the World Cup, which may limit the ability of supporters to attend the tournament.\n\nInfantino has cultivated a personal relationship with Trump, even attending his inauguration. But multiple sources say FIFA \u2014 whose newly-appointed head of immigration, Josh Wodka, is a former staffer for presidential candidate Kamala Harris \u2014 is struggling to make sufficient inroads with the new administration on a working level. FIFA insists Wodka\u2019s role within the government relations team will be internal facing rather than communicating with the government directly.\n\nFIFA says it held a meeting in the past two weeks that involved unspecified White House personnel and State Department officials but not Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose deputy chief of staff was instead present.\n\nGeoff Freeman, the chief executive for the U.S. Travel Association, a non-profit that advocates for the travel industry, warns that the U.S. is \u201calready behind the eight ball, needs to move with a greater degree of urgency and that planning needs to go into this at a federal level.\u201d\n\nTravis Murphy, a former State Department diplomat who previously ran governmental affairs for the NBA, says America faces a philosophical question as to whether it wants the World Cup to be an event that is \u201copen and inclusive\u201d to the world.\n\nGO DEEPER Trump, Infantino and a sporting political bromance that isn't slowing down\n\nThe State Department spokesperson did not respond directly to the points raised in this article, saying only that \u201cthey are committed to protecting the nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through the visa process.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement to The Athletic, FIFA appeared to urge the Trump administration to stand by its previous commitments and recognize the potential economic benefits for the country.\n\nA spokesperson said: \u201cIt is worth noting that the current administration was in office during the successful bid process for 2026, and signed the government guarantees as part of that process. We continue to work with various departments and agencies of the U.S. Government to ensure the U.S. can capitalize on this once-in-a-generation opportunity to tap into billions of dollars in positive financial benefits and goodwill and bring millions of people from different nations and communities together to celebrate in the United States.\u201d\n\nWhen nations bid to host a World Cup, FIFA requests assurances that countries will do their utmost to facilitate travel and visa access in order to fill stadiums, sell out fan zones, drive tourism associated with the tournament and have as competitive a marketplace as possible to fuel ticket sales. A recent report by the U.S. Travel Association said that six million people could visit the country for the World Cup, providing it is made possible by the visa process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis will also be the largest World Cup in history, as FIFA\u2019s tournament expands to 48 competing nations. Qualification is ongoing, and many supporters across the world will not know until much closer to the event whether their team will be present, while tickets are also still to go on sale. These factors make it unlikely for fans to apply for visas ahead of time, and it means the need to reduce wait times closer to the summer of 2026 is essential.\n\nSome countries likely to compete in the tournament should have relatively smooth access for visitors. Forty-two countries, including many in Europe as well as Japan, South Korea and Australia, are part of a visa waiver program \u2014 ESTA \u2014 to enter the U.S. This system means citizens of these countries can travel without obtaining a visa, so long as their trip for tourism or business does not exceed 90 days; however, those traveling from many possible contending nations for the World Cup do require visas. This includes Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay, among many other Latin American nations, as well as large swathes of the Middle East and Africa.\n\nGO DEEPER President Trump has the World Cup trophy in the Oval Office. Or does he?\n\nFor the previous men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, visitors were able to expedite their entry into the gulf state by applying for a Hayya card, which was effectively a fan pass for World Cup ticket-holders that doubled up as the visa for the tournament.\n\nIn recent years, FIFA had hoped to develop similar systems for 2026, but this was rejected by the U.S. government, largely due to global security concerns during a period of history where tensions have been high with Russia, China and various places within the Middle East. The Americans also knocked back an attempt by FIFA to introduce a Schengen-style pass for World Cup ticket-holders and teams that would enable visitors to have a single visa to attend the tournament across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Instead, the three host countries will each have differing entry criteria for visitors.\n\nMultiple State Department officials explained that FIFA\u2019s requests were deemed even by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to be \u201cout of the norm and wildly unrealistic.\u201d While previous World Cup hosts have passed legislation to enable visa access for World Cup ticket-holders, the reality is that it is extremely difficult to pass immigration bills through U.S. Congress, particularly given the sensitivities around the topic in recent years. The government employees added that it was unrealistic to expect the U.S. to follow the lead of countries such as Qatar or Russia, because, they argued, those countries are not deemed globally to be desirable places for people to seek permanent residence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe State Department has previously succeeded in bringing down extremely long wait times in Argentina and Brazil, which are now down to around a month, and the cause was helped by $50 million set aside \u201cto reduce passport backlogs and reduce visa wait times\u201d in a bill signed into law by President Biden in March 2024. The simplest method to reduce wait times is additional staff and consular officers at embassies, but at a time when the size of the U.S. state is being reduced, employees fear that the previous progress in key markets may be reversed, while those struggling with wait times may worsen.\n\nNations whose citizens require visas to enter the U.S. are subject to stringent interviews. These interviews take place at consulates across the world and usually last a couple of minutes, during which they must convince U.S. officials of their legitimate reason for travel.\n\nState Department officials said that a ticket for a World Cup game, or the cheaper ticket for a FIFA Fan Zone during the tournament, will be unlikely to suffice alone. A State Department employee explained that a young man from Morocco, which reached the semifinal of the World Cup in 2022, or Nigeria, in another example provided, would also likely need to show they have a residence abroad where they would be compelled to return, and it would also be beneficial to show solid employment and a past record of foreign travel.\n\nFormer U.S. Soccer President Carlos Cordeiro alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in 2018. (Photo by Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nIn short, a World Cup ticket alone may not be deemed a legitimate reason for entry. FIFA, in its statement to The Athletic, said: \u201cFans can apply for visas at any time to start the process, and they do not need to wait for a ticket. Importantly, however, a ticket does not guarantee a visa, nor does a visa guarantee a ticket.\u201d\n\nShowing a World Cup ticket as evidence would be a challenge because, as per guidance issued on U.S. consulate websites, electronic devices such as mobile phones or laptops are not permitted within embassies for security reasons. The most secure means of demonstrating a ticket \u2014 via a QR code \u2014 is therefore not feasible at an interview, while paper tickets come with a counterfeit risk.\n\nThe level of scrutiny applied to candidates is only expected to increase under the Trump administration. He has already signed an executive order that calls for \u201cenhanced vetting and screening\u201d of people entering the country.\n\nState Department officials are also braced for a repeat of Trump\u2019s first term, when travel bans were implemented against nations. Trump signed an executive order in his first term that limited entry into the U.S. for refugees and banned foreign nationals from several predominantly Muslim countries entering the U.S. for 90 days.\n\nGO DEEPER Canada manager Marsch hits back at Trump's '51st state' remarks\n\nThe Athletic has previously reported how voters in the World Cup bidding process were disturbed to read reports in the American media that claimed Trump had caused offense by asking why his country should accept immigrants from \u201cs***hole\u201d countries such as Haiti in the Caribbean and some African nations. The State Department did not answer when asked whether it is able to clarify which countries will receive travel bans and how this would be consistent with Trump\u2019s assurances of access to the U.S. made to FIFA in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the challenges of visa wait times differ from country to country, there are some significant shared challenges due to the new administration\u2019s policies. A Presidential Memorandum has initiated a hiring freeze, while State Department employees warned others are exiting the service; either via retirements or deciding to leave.\n\nTravis Murphy, the founder of Jetr Global Sports + Entertainment and a former American diplomat said: \u201cThe wait times will absolutely see the impact of staff reductions. \u2026 Wait times are only going to go up, not down.\u201d\n\nFreeman, the CEO of U.S. Travel, warns that \u201c45 per cent of the travelers that visit the United States come from countries where a visa is required. We\u2019re talking Brazil, Colombia, Argentina. These are all countries where visas are required. If you look at Colombia, the wait time to get an interview for a visa is over 700 days. The window is closed. The visa issue is absolutely critical to the success of the \u201926 World Cup.\u201d\n\nSince winning the presidential election in November, Trump has signposted his support for FIFA\u2019s tournaments in the U.S. and most clearly for Infantino. At an address in Miami during the Saudi-backed FII Summit last week, Trump asked Infantino to stand up to be applauded and described the FIFA president as \u201cthe most important person, at least until the World Cup is over,\u201d calling him \u201cthe king of soccer.\u201d\n\nYet it remains to be seen whether the administration\u2019s policies and relationship on a working level with FIFA may contradict this stance. FIFA, it should be said, did not have it all their own way with the Biden administration, and The Athletic reported in April 2024 how FIFA had raised the matter of visa wait times in a meeting at the White House last spring. Multiple sources familiar with the current state of play said that FIFA officials had been struggling to make meaningful progress with Rubio, who has yet to meet FIFA representatives in person. A FIFA spokesperson said the organization did meet with the Secretary of State\u2019s deputy chief of staff, along with White House officials, during the past month and that Rubio requested background points on the conversation.\n\nOne of FIFA\u2019s most recent hires in this space is Wodka, the new head of immigration. According to his LinkedIn page, he formerly worked for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \u201cresponsible for implementing the Biden administration\u2019s immigration priorities,\u201d while he previously worked directly for Trump\u2019s presidential rival, Harris. Before that, he directed the financial operations of her bid to become a senator.\n\nSeveral sources speculated as to how he would be received within Trump\u2019s administration, which has been highly critical of Biden\u2019s approach to immigration. The State Department did not comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreeman, the U.S. Travel CEO, believes further steps are needed, specifically the \u201ccreation of an interagency task force led out of the White House\u201d to bring about a degree of central control and ownership of the matter. It is not only the World Cup that may be impacted, as U.S. Travel estimates that 40 million people could visit the U.S. for the World Cup, the Olympics, Paralympics, 2025 Ryder Cup and America\u2019s 250th birthday in 2026. He says that the World Cup will prove a \u201cgreat test\u201d as to whether the administration can simultaneously manage its border more effectively, while also encouraging travel.\n\nOne positive for FIFA is that it has worked with the State Department to find a way to verify legitimate visitors who form part of the traveling party for national teams, federations, support staff and sponsors, although the government declined to explain how this will work in practice. There is no such system for fans.\n\n48 teams will be vying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup trophy, but fans from all of those nations may have a difficult time seeing it in person (Photo by Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFor supporters, a nervous wait may beckon. This week, the State Department declined to answer how the U.S. government intends to resolve these challenges, or set out any plan at all, when asked by The Athletic. It, along with the White House, also did not comment when asked if both Trump and the State Department maintain the position set out by the president in his guarantees to FIFA seven years ago. It also did not respond when asked to outline the importance of the tournament to the U.S.\n\nMurphy, the former diplomat, said: \u201cThe president is a sports fan and has said he is supportive of the World Cup, but at a working level, there thus far does not appear to be a plan in place that makes this a priority. Overall, teams, federations and sponsors will likely be fine, but there will be real issues for fans. In addition to extended wait times, clearance processes for visas are only getting more diligent.\u201d\n\nAs the clock ticks down, some within the State Department are wondering whether the U.S. government may pivot to arguing for an America-first approach to filling the stadiums at the World Cup, which would be a departure from FIFA\u2019s usual mission of attracting the world to its mega-events.\n\nMurphy concludes: \u201cThere\u2019s a philosophical discussion at play here: do we as a country and as a government want first-time visa applicants to travel for this event? There has been a lot of talk and commitments made about this being an open and inclusive event. But, increasingly, I think we have to face the reality that this will be an event for people who are traveling from ESTA countries who can travel with a visa waiver or who already have a visa. I assume that\u2019s not what FIFA wants. And I don\u2019t think that has \u2014 at least not publicly \u2014 been the position of the United States.\n\n\u201cThere are also many other events that would ostensibly benefit from international visitors in 2026, including the World Baseball Classic and celebrations around the 250th anniversary of the United States. For that, the president has indicated that he wants there to be a year-long state fair and have people from around the world attend. But how do we reconcile that when wait times exceed two and three years at major embassies?\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)",

            "content": "Six weeks into the second Trump administration, and days after President Trump vowed to push back on \u201cillegal protests\u201d on college campuses, the State Department has pulled the first visa of a foreign student who engaged in pro-Hamas disruptions. That\u2019s the right thing to do if we want to fix campus cultures. And contrary to disingenuous critics, such a move poses no First Amendment problems.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s a basic application of U.S. immigration law, which says that people here on a visa (tourist, student, employment, or otherwise) who reveal themselves to be ineligible for that visa\u2014\u201cinadmissible,\u201d in the parlance of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA)\u2014can have their visa revoked. As I wrote in a broader analysis of campus-related civil rights issues after the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel, \u201cThe Immigration and Nationality Act allows the denial or revocation of a visa of \u2018any alien who . . . endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization.\u2019\u201d Biden\u2019s State Department also told then-Senator Marco Rubio that it could revoke the visas of Hamas supporters.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all Trump can do. The INA\u2019s inadmissibility provision also empowers the president to \u201csuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\u201d whom he determines to be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States\u201d or to impose on them \u201cany restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d During Trump\u2019s first term, the Supreme Court upheld that broad grant of presidential discretion to vet, restrict, and even ban immigrants\u2014and thus to direct executive-agency action in that regard\u2014at the culmination of the high-profile \u201ctravel ban\u201d litigation. In Trump v. Hawaii, the Court okayed an executive order restricting travel from various countries, with Chief Justice John Roberts affirming that the only statutory requirement is that the president \u201cfind\u201d the entry of the affected aliens to be \u201cdetrimental to the national interest.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening now. In one of the first executive orders Trump signed, he directed federal agencies to strengthen vetting and screening of those seeking admission and those already in the country, because \u201cthe United States must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the United States do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to our national security.\u201d Then, as part of the \u201cAdditional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism,\u201d he ordered the use of \u201call available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\u201d\n\nAll of this makes eminent sense: it\u2019s the government\u2019s duty to screen out visitors and migrants who would be harmful to our country, including those who reject our values or are hostile to our way of life, such as Communists, Nazis, or Islamists. When I got my green card, and again when I naturalized, I had to affirm that I wasn\u2019t affiliated with these groups \u201cor any other totalitarian party.\u201d To give another example in a different context, in 2020, 1,000 Chinese nationals had their visas revoked for being national security risks\u2014and the Biden administration successfully defended that Trump action in court.\n\nThese core government functions are supported by law. As the INA says, \u201cThe admission to the United States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe.\u201d Other provisions of the law cover \u201ctravel controls of citizens and aliens,\u201d \u201cissuance of visas,\u201d and \u201cdeportable aliens.\u201d\n\nWhile the government can\u2019t send foreigners to jail for saying things it doesn\u2019t like, it can and should deny or pull visas for those who advocate for causes inimical to the United States. There\u2019s nothing objectional or controversial about removing those who harass, intimidate, vandalize, and otherwise interfere with an educational institution\u2019s core mission. More, please.\n\nPhoto by YOUSSEF ALZANOUN/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images",

Trump has issued numerous orders calling for the government to crack down on pro-Palestine protesters, and this week, threatened to imprison or deport activists participating in student protests for Palestinian rights.\n\nThe program represents an alarming escalation against the right to freedom of expression for advocates for Palestinian rights, who have already faced heavy repression for opposition to the Gaza genocide and in decades past. Advocates have raised alarm over the program, saying that it clearly tramples on free speech rights and harkens back to historic repression and surveillance of anti-war and Muslim advocates under laws like the Patriot Act.\n\n\u201cThis should concern all Americans. This is a First Amendment and freedom of speech issue and the administration will overplay its hand,\u201d Abed Ayoub, executive director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Axios. \u201cAmericans won\u2019t like this. They\u2019ll view this as capitulating free speech rights for a foreign nation.\u201d\n\nAyoub said that the program parallels the Nixon administration\u2019s Operation Boulder, in which the federal government surveilled and repressed Arab Americans in the wake of the 1967 Naksa, in which Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, and the Syrian Golan Heights.\n\n\u201cAnother reminder that Palestine is the canary in the coal mine of authoritarianism and repression,\u201d said Middle East analyst Yousef Munayyer, who heads the Arab Center Washington D.C.\u2019s Palestine/Israel program. \u201cThe bombs they drop in Palestine won\u2019t stay there. The laws that target Palestine won\u2019t stop there. The tech tools they abuse won\u2019t be limited to there.\u201d\n\nAyoub further pointed out that the use of AI in the program is particularly concerning.\n\n\u201cWith the advent of AI, it\u2019s even scarier because they\u2019re policing speech and using faulty technology,\u201d Ayoub said.\n\nIndeed, AI technologies have been demonstrated to have racist biases, including Islamophobia.\n\nFurther, it\u2019s unclear what AI programs are being used, but the Israeli military has made extensive use of U.S.-created AI technology in order to generate targets for assassination \u2014 including children \u2014 as part of its genocide in Gaza. Israel is also reportedly training a ChatGPT-like software on Arabic conversations obtained through surveillance of Palestinians, which experts say the military could use to incriminate and target Palestinians.\n\nUnlike mainstream media, we\u2019re not capitulating to Trump. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations \u2013 either through need or greed \u2013 rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump\u2019s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models.

Former Trump aide Steve Bannon called the program \u201ca total and complete scam to destroy the American worker\u201d and demanded \u201creparations for tech workers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA wave of tech industry figures immediately showed support for immigrant tech workers, many of whom have founded or now run the industry\u2019s most successful companies.\n\nBut after saying he\u2019d go to war for the H-1B program, Musk tweeted, \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform.\u201d\n\nAndreesen, whose iconoclastic views are often a leading indicator of Silicon Valley thinking, said on the Lex Fridman podcast last month that the social media controversy prompted him to think deeply about the issue. The venture capitalist has long expressed unequivocal support for the H-1B program, even visiting Washington to inform lawmakers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have been in a 60-year social engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAndreessen, in a long and multifaceted argument, didn\u2019t advocate getting rid of the H-1B program. Instead, he said the US needs to both bring in highly skilled labor and provide more opportunities to Americans from every background.\n\nBut his arguments sound surprisingly like the objections, long dismissed in Silicon Valley, of labor unions and groups representing American-born engineers who believe that a wave of Indian workers has depressed their wages and job opportunities.",

Richard Blumenthal this week pressed Visa for detailed plans and documents related to its deal to provide payments services to Elon Musk's social media site, X, as it prepares to launch a digital wallet.\n\nBlumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and the ranking member of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, pointed to Musk's role in hobbling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 the consumer watchdog that would be a key regulator of the X Money service \u2014 as among the reasons for the information request, according to a March 6 letter obtained by CNBC.\n\n\"Given the unique position of X Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Elon Musk as leader of the Department of Government Efficiency and his recent role in gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2026 Visa stands to take advantage of the deep conflicts of interest and unscrupulous conduct of its new business partner,\" Blumenthal wrote.\n\nThe Senate request is one of the first signs of scrutiny on Visa, which runs the world's largest credit card network, after a late January announcement that it had agreed to power peer-to-peer payments on X. Days after the deal was disclosed, operatives from Musk's Department of Government Efficiency gained access to CFPB data systems, leading to accusations that Musk wanted to kneecap a future regulator and that he could steal trade secrets of competitors to his nascent X Money service.\n\nThe letter, addressed to Visa CEO Ryan McInerney, also cast doubts about whether a social media network known for \"bots, scams and hate speech\" would be able to prevent scams and fraud from proliferating on the site. Musk purchased the site in 2022, when it was known as Twitter.\n\n\"These concerns raise questions about X's ability to protect consumers from fraud and scams as it ventures into the financial sector,\" Blumenthal wrote.\n\n\"As the largest payment processor in the world, Visa has a legal responsibility to ensure its network is free of financial crime such as scams and fraud, money-laundering, terrorist financing, and more,\" he said.\n\nBlumenthal asked for a detailed description of Visa's plans to enable payments on X, including the business model of the service and Visa's role in compliance with regulatory requirements around money laundering and illicit remittances.\n\nHe also pressed Visa for \"all records\" related to the deal and communications between X, Visa, DOGE and CFPB personnel.\n\n\"We are currently reviewing the letter and will respond appropriately,\" a Visa spokesman said in a statement.\n\nA representative for X didn't immediately have comment.",

            "content": "The 2025 H-1B visa lottery registration period starts today, March 7, 2025, at 12pm EST and runs until 12pm EST on March 24. The government issues 85,000 H-1B visa numbers each year, 20,000 of which are set aside specifically for US masters degree holders. This is the one and only opportunity each year for employers to secure a chance to sponsor their talented foreign professionals for a longer term work visa. Interested employers can register any number of foreign professionals over the next two weeks, and USCIS will notify employers about any selected registrants by the end of March. These employers will then have 90 days, from April 1, 2025 until June 30, 2025, to file an H-1B visa petition with USCIS. Upon approval of the H-1B petition, the worker can start H-1B employment from October 1, 2025.\n\nTo qualify for an H-1B visa, the foreign professional must (1) undertake a \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d designated as a professional level job requiring a minimum of a bachelor degree in a specific specialty or academic discipline, and (2) possess a minimum of a bachelor degree in a directly related academic discipline. H-1B workers get a maximum of six years of work authorization, with the potential for extensions beyond the six-year period if the worker is sponsored for permanent residence (\u201cgreen card\u201d). Please contact our team if you employ any F-1 international students, or other foreign nationals on temporary work visas who would benefit from the chance for a longer-term nonimmigrant visa.\n\nWho Needs an H-1B Visa?\n\nIn light of the Trump administration\u2019s intention to make sweeping changes to immigration policy and the significant steps it has already taken in one month to limit or end certain humanitarian-based immigration programs, it is only a matter of time before work visa programs come under scrutiny. Employers should take inventory of any foreign workers they employ and review with counsel whether it would be beneficial to register them for the H-1B lottery. While there is no guarantee the worker will win the lottery, this opportunity only comes once per year.\n\nWhile we have not always urged employers to register foreign professionals who are employed pursuant to some other employer-sponsored work visa or have some other basis for work, the current political headwinds demand that employers of foreign professionals take a different approach by trying to secure a more stable work visa, such as H-1B, for these individuals. We urge employers to consider registering any current or future employees who are present in the U.S. under the following categories due to possible program vulnerabilities:\n\nTN visas for Canadian and Mexican professionals; E-3 visas for Australians; and H-1B1 visas for Chileans\n\nThe TN, E-3 and H-1B1 professional work visas are authorized by free trade agreements between the US and Canada (TN), Mexico (TN), Australia (E-3), Chile (H-1B1) and Singapore (H-1B1) respectively. When he took office, President Trump signed the America First Trade Policy placing a heavy focus on issuing restrictive international trade measures, such as tariffs on foreign trading partners, signaling his intention to significantly reshape international trade in an effort to prioritize US economic interests. These efforts could undermine free trade provisions that support the transfer of professional foreign labor to the US, such as the TN, E-3 and H-1B1 work visa programs. For example, the free trade agreement known as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA formerly known as NAFTA), which authorizes TN visas, is scheduled for a standard review in July 2026, but the Trump administration may use the opportunity to substantially renegotiate the agreement. In light of the uncertainty over the outcome of any renegotiations, employers may want to consider transitioning workers on free trade visas, such as TN, E-3 and H-1B1, to the H-1B visa which stands on firmer ground because it was created through legislation passed by Congress rather than a trade agreement.\n\nF-1 student visas\n\nInternational students on F-1 visas are eligible for a limited amount of full-time schoolwork authorization after graduation called optional practical training (OPT). Students can get 1-3 years of OPT depending on whether they completed a qualifying STEM degree. An international student must have another basis for work authorization by the time OPT ends to continue employment. Since lottery selection is not guaranteed, an employer should register any F-1 OPT workers for the H-1B lottery in each available year to maximize their chance of selection.\n\nJ-1 exchange visitor visas\n\nThe J-1 visa is for various types of foreign exchange. There are several different J-1 visa exchange programs including those for interns, trainees, short term scholars, professors, and foreign doctors, among others. Interns and trainees receive only 12-18 months of work authorization, so the H-1B lottery offers the possibility of more stable, longer term work authorization.\n\nL-1 visas for managerial and specialized knowledge workers\n\nL-1 visas are for intracompany transfers of managers/executives (L-1A) and specialized knowledge workers (L-1B). They provide 7 and 5 years of work authorization respectively but cannot be extended beyond that period. Citizens of many countries, such as India and China, face lengthy multi-year backlogs for green cards, so if a green card has not been approved by the end the L-1 maximum time, the worker would lose the ability to work. Transitioning Chinese or Indian L-1 workers to H-1B status would better ensure their continuous work authorization through indefinite extensions until the worker achieves permanent residence.\n\nL-2S, E-2S and H-4 Spouses\n\nSpouses in derivative dependent statuses such as L-2S, E-2S and some spouses in H-4 status, are eligible for work authorization, but their ability to work is wholly dependent on the principal spouse worker maintaining valid L-1, E-2 or H-1B status. If the Trump administration slows down immigration benefit processing as it did during Trump\u2019s first term, workers in these categories are vulnerable to gaps in work authorization and losing their jobs. In addition, the first Trump administration tried to rescind work permits for H-4 spouses which, if this administration recycles that effort, makes work permits for dependent spouses even more vulnerable. H-1B status would better secure their ability to work.\n\nE-1 or E-2 treaty investor and trader visas\n\nE-1 and E-2 visas are temporary nonimmigrant visas authorized by qualifying investment or trade treaties that the US has with various countries. They authorize the transfer of managers, executives and specialists who are citizens of a qualifying treaty country to help operate a US investment enterprise or trade operation. An H-1B visa would be beneficial for E-1 or E-2 workers who wish to pursue permanent residence (green card) and must maintain the unrestricted ability to travel throughout the lengthy green card process. H-1B status is codified as a \u201cdual intent\u201d nonimmigrant status which means the worker can safely pursue a green card while enjoying unrestricted travel throughout. On the other hand, E-1 and E-2 status are single intent nonimmigrant statuses which only permit temporary stays in the US, so attempting to reenter the US under E-1/E-2 visa with a pending green card process could be perceived as a status violation. An H-1B visa for this subset of workers would allow them the freedom to travel internationally and carry on their jobs without skipping a beat.\n\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS)\n\nTPS is a humanitarian immigration benefit issued to citizens of countries facing catastrophic or humanitarian crises such as natural disasters or civil wars. TPS individuals are eligible for work permits called employment authorization documents (EAD). TPS designation usually lasts for two years and must be re-designated by the US government. The Trump administration has already taken steps to end TPS designation for certain countries such as Venezuela and Haiti, and there could be more on the horizon. An employer should register qualifying TPS workers for the H-1B lottery to better secure their ability to work.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn light of the potential vulnerabilities facing some foreign workers under this administration, we encourage employers to register employees currently employed in these categories for the H-1B visa lottery, which can be a more stable, longer-term work visa.",

Fees have jumped by at least 25% since 2017, costing U.K. businesses at least an extra 170 million pounds (about $219 million) per year.\n\nThe companies have not offered \u201csufficiently clear and detailed information\u201d on fees, leading to worsening outcomes for merchants and acquirers, especially in terms of raising their costs, per the release.\n\n\u201cThey then have little choice but to either pass these increased costs onto consumers or incur the costs themselves, impacting their ability to invest,\u201d the release said.\n\nMastercard emailed the following statement to PYMNTS:\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the findings in today\u2019s report, which continues to underplay the true competitiveness of the payment industry and our ongoing innovation and investment into security and the consumer experience. Our resilient, global network provides peace of mind and strong consumer protections, preventing billions of pounds of fraud each year. We will continue to work transparently with our customers and demonstrate to the PSR the significant value Mastercard and electronic payments bring to people and businesses across the UK.\u201d\n\nReached for comment by PYMNTS, a Visa spokesperson said the company\u2019s fees reflect the \u201cimmense value\u201d the company provides merchants, consumers and financial institutions.\n\n\u201cThis includes extremely high levels of security and fraud prevention, near-perfect operational resilience and reliability, and a wide range of consumer protections and high-quality products and services that serve consumer and merchant needs,\u201d the company said. \u201cThrough our investments, the U.K. has been a global pioneer in payments technology.\u201d\n\nThe PSR\u2019s action came as Mastercard\u2019s and Visa\u2019s place in the marketplace is being called into question elsewhere.\n\nFor example, November brought a report that the European Commission was investigating whether the companies\u2019 \u201cscheme fees\u201d were harming retailers.\n\nAlso in November, the Senate Judiciary Committee convened a hearing on Visa\u2019s and Mastercard\u2019s fees, with Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, then-chair of the committee, accusing the companies of having a \u201cstranglehold\u201d on the credit card market.",

It allows skilled workers to secure jobs in specialized fields such as technology, engineering, healthcare, and finance. However, due to high demand, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has implemented strict eligibility criteria and a lottery system to manage applications.The United States government has recently intensified efforts to ensure American workers are given priority in employment opportunities, particularly concerning the H-1B visa program. This program allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. However, concerns have arisen that some employers might be favoring foreign workers over equally qualified American citizens.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a final rule on December 17, 2024, aimed at enhancing the H-1B program's integrity and oversight. This rule modernizes the definition and criteria for specialty occupation positions and extends certain flexibilities for students on F-1 visas transitioning to H-1B status. Additionally, it strengthens program integrity by codifying the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) authority to conduct inspections and impose penalties for non-compliance.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has intensified its enforcement against national origin discrimination, specifically targeting employers that unlawfully prioritize foreign workers on H-1B visas over American employees. EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas emphasized that businesses contributing to immigration challenges through illegal hiring preferences must comply with federal law. The agency aims to protect all workers from unlawful discrimination, including American workers.Indian nationals have historically been significant beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In 2023, 72% of these visas were granted to Indians.The recent enforcement measures may lead to increased scrutiny of applications and hiring practices, potentially affecting the number of visas issued to Indian professionals. However, the Indian government has proactively engaged with the U.S. to address these concerns. For instance, India has proposed repatriating 18,000 illegal Indian immigrants from the U.S. to persuade the Trump administration to maintain key visa programs for Indian citizens.The tech industry, which heavily relies on the H-1B program for skilled labor, has expressed concerns over potential talent shortages due to stricter immigration policies. During Trump's previous presidency, H-1B visa denial rates surged, affecting tech companies reliant on these visas. Industry leaders highlight the struggle with restrictive policies and emphasize the severe impact on sectors needing AI skills.The USCIS has announced that the registration window for the fiscal year 2026 H-1B visa lottery will open at noon (ET) on March 7, 2025, and close at noon (ET) on March 24, 2025. Employers must submit registrations through the USCIS online system, and each beneficiary must be registered separately with an associated fee.For the fiscal year 2025, which began on April 1, 2024, USCIS reported receiving a high number of applications, reaching the annual cap, including the master's degree exemption (advanced degree cap). This trend indicates stiff competition for the H-1B visa 2025 season.The H-1B visa is designed for highly skilled professionals who meet specific qualifications. To qualify, applicants must:To qualify as a specialty occupation, the job must:Common industries that utilize the H-1B visa program include IT, engineering, medicine, finance, and research.Since demand for H-1B visas exceeds supply, USCIS conducts a lottery system. The process includes:Indian professionals dominate the H-1B visa landscape, receiving 72.3% of all H-1B visas issued between October 2022 and September 2023. However, recent policy changes could impact their chances:Under the Trump administration, policies aimed to prioritize American workers by scrutinizing visa applications. Many companies faced increased denials and requests for additional evidence. The Biden administration initially reversed some policies, making the process more accessible, but recent developments suggest a return to stricter oversight.A bachelor\u2019s degree, a US job offer, and employer sponsorship are required.It opens on March 7, 2025, and runs until March 24, 2025.",

Credit: Pillar Media\n\nWith a visa program for non-ordained religious workers due to expire March 13, the USCCB told The Pillar Wednesday that its expiration could hit rural and underserved dioceses especially hard.\n\nShare\n\n\u2014\n\nThe EB-4 non-minister special immigration religious workers visa program will close March 13, at the end of a short-term extension signed in December last year.\n\nThe program, which issues 5,000 visas a year, is used by Catholic religious orders and other institutions to secure permanent residence \u2014 and a path to citizenship \u2014 for a range of non-ordained applicants ineligible for other kinds of religious worker visas.\n\nThe EB-4 Special Immigrant Religious Worker Visa is distinct from the R-1 temporary religious worker visa program, which does not come with an automatic green card. That program, used by foreign-born priests in the U.S., is itself mired in backlogs and delays, which have forced many priests and religious to leave the U.S.\n\nThere are two kinds of EB-4 visas available under the current system: ministerial and non-ministerial, with the first class usually only available to clergy or their equivalent \u2014 those qualified to lead religious worship or perform the equivalent of sacramental ministry.\n\nNon-ministerial EB-4 visas allow for religious organizations to sponsor workers who are not ministers to immigrate to the United States, in order to perform services in their religious vocations or occupation.\n\nThose kinds of visas, which are used by religious communities and diocesan-sponsored laity, are now in jeopardy.\n\nAccording to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, \u201cexamples of those working as part of a vocation include nuns, monks, [religious] brothers, and sisters.\u201d\n\nWork performed by those visa holders includes care for the sick, aged, and dying in hospitals and special facilities, work in youth ministry, religious education in parishes and Catholic schools, and leadership or administration of Catholic religious orders and institutions.\n\nThe bishops\u2019 conference noted in 2022 that the statutory provision for non-minister special immigrant religious workers is not a permanent part of U.S. immigration law, but instead sunsets at given intervals.\n\nThe most recent such sunset clause was due to come into effect late last year, when President Joe Biden signed a December 21 extension until March 13 of this year.\n\nConfirming that the program is now set to end, recent guidance from the U.S. State Department says that \u201cno [EB-4 non-ministerial] visas may be issued overseas, or final action taken on adjustment of status cases, after midnight March 13, 2025. Visas issued prior to that date will be valid only until March 13, 2025, and all individuals seeking admission in the non-minister special immigrant category must be admitted (repeat, admitted) into the United States no later than midnight March 13, 2025.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the event there is no legislative action extending the category beyond March 14, 2025, the category will immediately become \u2018Unavailable\u2019 as of March 14, 2025,\u201d the State Department guidance says.\n\nPrior to the non-ministerial immigrant religious worker visa program\u2019s introduction in 1990, religious organizations attempting to use traditional employment immigration categories for non-ministerial workers faced \u201csometimes insurmountable obstacles,\u201d according to the bishops\u2019 conference.\n\n\u201cThe resulting consequences were that religious entities found that they could not sponsor workers at all or could not do so within a timeframe that corresponded to their needs,\u201d the conference said in 2022.\n\nDavid Spicer, assistant director for policy for migration and refugee services at the USCCB, told The Pillar that thousands of Catholic religious workers have entered the country via the program over the last three decades.\n\n\u201cAll of our men and women religious and other laypersons who may come as missionaries or in other capacities, they fall into this non-minister category,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cI think probably the Catholic Church accounts for the largest number of these non-ministers within the program\u2026 We have priests and deacons defined as ministers, and then everyone else would fall into the non-minister category. So it's a very significant impact that \u2018non-ministerial\u2019 portion is having on Catholic ministries across the country.\u201d\n\nBut Spicer said, the end of the non-ministerial visa program will impact more than teachers, catechists, or caregivers.\n\nIt will also impact religious vocations, he said.\n\nSubscribe now\n\n\u201cWith formation for the priesthood, a diocese will usually send a man to a formal seminary associated with an institution of higher education, so that could provide a different opportunity for a student visa perhaps,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cBut in the case of religious congregations, it's not always the case that their formation is so formal that they could have the postulant on a student visa.\u201d\n\nInstead, Spicer said, leaders of religious communities have relied on the non-ministerial religious worker visa programs for members in formation. And since religious profession is a lifelong commitment, the path to permanent residency is important.\n\n\u201cI know of a mother superior in Alaska who had to depart the country and leave her community behind,\u201d Spicer recalled, \u201cand that had significant impact on the Church there in Alaska, which is one of the places where we rely most heavily on these foreign-born religious workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe geographic scope of the dioceses there make it very difficult to minister to Catholics spread all throughout such a large territory. And so foreign-born religious workers are often the only real way that they can do that.\u201d\n\nSpicer added that the non-ministerial visa program is used for cloistered religious, and religious sisters who work in the administration of their congregations and orders.\n\nBecause the EB-4 visa program is for permanent immigrant status with a path to citizenship, Spicer confirmed that the pending closure would not affect those visa recipients already in the country, since they would have green cards, but nevertheless could affect other religious workers already in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is the potential for somebody who's here on an R-1 visa, and even with the backlog there, we may have men in women religious and others who fall into the non-minister category who are here within their five year temporary period when their visa number comes up for the EB-4, to be able to get a green card,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut in order to take advantage of that, the program still has to be available. So we could have a really unfortunate situation where somebody has been waiting in the EB-4 backlog, is classified as a non-minister, and then just as they're about to become eligible to get a green card the program is no longer accessible to them.\u201d\n\nWhile the program is set to close in little more than a week, Spicer said that some kind of extension remains possible.\n\n\u201cWe've had a couple of continuing resolutions now, already, for fiscal year 2025 appropriations,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cGod willing, if Congress were to reach an agreement on a [resolution] by the March 14 deadline, they could take a similar approach and that would extend the non-minister provision, and other programs as well for the duration of the resolution.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty, he said, points to a need for the EB-4 program to be put on a permanent footing, which the USCCB has advocated for.\n\nIn April 2024, Bishop Mark Seitz, chair of the conference\u2019s Committee on Migration, wrote to legislators, noting that \u201cthe wait time for an EB-4 visa has increased drastically for most nationalities, now far longer for this category than any other employment-based category.\u201d\n\nThe bishop urged \u201cthat Congress permanently reauthorize this small but important program.\u201d\n\nSubscribe now",

            "content": "The US president, Donald Trump, is set to introduce a \u201cgold card\u201d visa that would allow wealthy foreigners to buy permanent US residency \u2013 and a path to citizenship \u2013 for US$5 million (\u00a33.9 million).\n\nSpeaking at the Oval Office on February 25, Trump said: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very treasured. I think it\u2019s going to do very well. And we\u2019re going to start selling, hopefully, in about two weeks.\u201d\n\nUS commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has touted the plan as a way to raise revenue to bring down US national debt, which currently stands at over US$36 trillion. As Trump put it when answering questions from reporters at the White House: \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that. And if you add up the numbers, they\u2019re pretty good. As an example, a million cards would be worth US$5 trillion.\u201d\n\nTrump has also suggested that the gold-card holders can help stimulate the US economy. \u201cThey\u2019ll be wealthy, and they\u2019ll be successful, and they\u2019ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes,\u201d he said. When asked whether Russian oligarchs would qualify for the visa, Trump responded: \u201cHey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nThe idea that wealthy foreigners can address a nation\u2019s faltering economy is not new. Trump\u2019s gold visas will themselves replace the current EB-5 immigrant investor visa, which offers permanent US residency in return for job-creating investments of at least US$1 million.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, various European nations also floated similar golden visa schemes as a means of reversing their economic downturns. The visas offered by Spain, Greece, Hungary and Portugal, for example, all cost significantly less than Trump\u2019s proposed scheme.\n\nA Spanish gold visa, which will no longer be available from April 2025, is granted in return for \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3417,000) in real estate investment. The required investment in Greece and Hungary is \u20ac250,000. And people looking to obtain a gold visa in Portugal have two options: a \u20ac250,000 donation to the restoration of national heritage, or a \u20ac500,000 property investment.\n\nThere is little data to support the argument that such policies boost the national coffers. Some experts have suggested that golden visa schemes typically bring in no more than 0.3% of GDP in revenue. So, it\u2019s no surprise that there is plenty of scepticism around whether Trump\u2019s gold card scheme can reduce US national debt.\n\nCritics of the plan argue that the scheme will not add trillions of US dollars to the economy, as Trump has claimed. This is because demand for any such programme is likely to be limited to thousands of people.\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by Forbes, 18 billionaires were asked if they would like to take advantage of an American gold card visa. Most of them (13) said they would not be interested. Many of the ultra-rich foreigners interviewed simply did not think they needed American citizenship and don\u2019t want it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a billionaire, you don\u2019t need it,\u201d said one Canadian billionaire. \u201cI don\u2019t have to come to the United States to invest in the United States.\u201d\n\nMarginal benefits\n\nThe global rich are unlikely to be queuing up for Trump\u2019s gold cards. At about US$5 million per application, it is \u201cthe most expensive\u201d golden visa option in the world. Any potential buyer will carry out cost-benefit analysis prior to committing to such a deal.\n\nTwo reasons a wealthy person might invest in a second or third passport are to ensure greater mobility and protect their wealth.\n\nUS tax laws have traditionally reduced the attractiveness of American residency or citizenship for the global rich. American citizens and residents are required to pay income tax on their US earnings as well as any income they earn overseas.\n\nTrump has said that gold-card holders would not be subject to taxes on their overseas income. This tax loophole could open the door to more wealthy foreigners looking to protect their wealth. However, many details about the scheme remain unclear.\n\nNotwithstanding this, golden visas in many other nations provide better opportunities than those offered by a Trump gold card. In terms of mobility, the US passport ranks eighth on an index of 198 different passports. American passport holders can travel to 171 countries without needing a visa.\n\nSpain ranks second, with a Spanish passport allowing access to 177 countries without a visa. And Portugal, Greece and a host of other European nations follow closely behind, with their passports allowing visa-free travel to 176 countries.\n\nThe most powerful passport in the world is offered by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), allowing access to 179 countries visa-free. The UAE government introduced a golden visa in 2019, offering long-term residence in exchange for roughly US$550,000 of investment.\n\nAn American passport also has its own inherent limitations and hazards.

            "content": "President Trump on Feb. 25 unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.\n\nThat term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.\n\n\"For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship,\" Mr. Trump said in a March 4 speech to a joint session of Congress. \"It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country.\"\n\nThe new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.\n\nThe U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.\n\nYet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.\n\n\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Feb. 25\n\nHere's what to know about the gold card plan.\n\nWhat is Trump's gold card?\n\nThe gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office on Feb. 25.\n\nThe cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.\n\n\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.\n\nGreen cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.\n\nGreen card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.\n\nWhen will the gold card be available?\n\nLutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.\n\nWill the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?\n\nYes, with Lutnick describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"\n\n\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"\n\nOne major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.\n\nHow much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?\n\nMr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"\n\nAt $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.\n\n\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"\n\nTypically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.\n\nIf roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.\n\nThe U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.\n\nWho could qualify for a gold card?\n\nAside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.\n\n\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.\n\nAsked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"\n\nHe added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"\n\nDo other nations offer gold cards?\n\nYes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.\n\nDoes the gold card need congressional approval?\n\nCongress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.\n\n\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"\n\ncontributed to this report.",

See our best credit cards page for other options.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card has a somewhat hidden identity. At first, it may seem like a fairly pedestrian rewards card, whose earnings capabilities start out strong but flame out in half a year. But a closer look shows that it offers big potential for anyone seeking exceptional redemption values on airfare.\n\nIn other words, what you miss out on in earning, you may be able to make up for in \"burning.\"\n\nHere are five things to know about the card.\n\n1. You'll get killer rewards ... for 6 months\n\nThe $0-annual-fee Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card doesn't offer a traditional upfront sign-up bonus after meeting a minimum spending requirement. But it does earn 5X points on up to $12,500 in combined spending on gas, grocery and drugstore purchases for the first six months of card ownership. All non-bonus-category purchases earn 1X back. That's a pretty stellar rate in multiple everyday spending areas \u2014 but it doesn't last.\n\nAfter the first six months or once you reach that spending cap, whichever comes first, the card drops down to earning just 1 point back per $1 spent. That's below the flat-rate industry standard of 1.5% back on everything, and there's no way to boost it again. You're stuck at that rate for as long as you hold the card.\n\nIt's also worth noting that points expire after five years \u2014 a long time, to be sure, but many credit cards offer rewards that never expire. If you want a card with more long-lasting rewards, explore our best credit card offers page.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\n2. Rewards are worth 50% more when used to book airfare via Wells Fargo\n\nWhere this card truly shines is its redemption rate. Typically, Wells Fargo rewards points are worth a penny each no matter how they're redeemed, meaning that if you were to max out the card's spending cap in the first six months, you'd snag at least $625 back. Not bad at all.\n\nBut the Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card is unique among the issuer's portfolio of cards, in that its points take on 50% more value when you redeem for plane tickets. For example, 20,000 points can be redeemed through the Go Far Rewards portal for $300 worth of airfare. That's a fantastic rate of 1.5 cents per point \u2014 especially for a card with an annual fee of $0.\n\nAnd if you happen to be a really big spender, the redemption rate gets even better: Put $50,000 or more on the card in one year, and points are then worth 1.75 cents each when redeemed for airfare through Wells Fargo.\n\n3. You can pool your earnings from other cards\n\nBetter yet, if you have other Wells Fargo cards that earn Go Far Rewards, you can move those earnings to your Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card and enjoy the higher redemption rate on airfare.\n\n4. It comes with cell phone protection\n\nThe Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card provides cell phone insurance for devices that have been damaged or stolen, as long as you pay your monthly phone bill with the card. The amount you'll get reimbursed is limited to the repair or replacement of your original phone, less a $25 deductible, with a maximum benefit of $600 per claim and $1,200 per 12-month period.\n\n5. You'll have access to Visa Signature perks\n\nThe Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card also carries some plush extras courtesy of its Visa Signature status including:\n\nPrice protection (an increasingly rare perk on a credit card).\n\nAuto rental collision coverage.\n\nTravel accident insurance.\n\nExtended warranty protection.\n\nHotel benefits through the Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection.",

            "content": "Selecting the venue for a global academic conference brings both opportunities and challenges. There are competing pressures: minimizing costs and travel distances for attendees while ensuring access to high-quality facilities and a reputable local university partner. However, one issue has become increasingly important: ease of access to travel visas.\n\nBecause immigration policies have tightened in some countries, particularly in North America and Europe, waiting times for visas have increased. For example, it can take Canadian visa authorities up to 18 months to process an application from someone in South Africa, according to the government\u2019s immigration services website.\n\nTear down visa barriers that block scholarship\n\nSuch visa-related difficulties impede global scientific dialogue and the free exchange of ideas. I\u2019ve become keenly aware of these issues as the president of the International Health Economics Association (IHEA) and tasked with planning a congress for July.\n\nOrganizing a global gathering of academics involves many months of planning. In 2023, we had selected Calgary, Canada, as the venue for the 2025 congress, after assessing submissions from several potential hosts. However, in April 2024, an IHEA committee member alerted us to the difficulties that researchers were encountering in obtaining visitor visas.\n\nWe explored workarounds, such as expediting the abstract submission and selection process and registering with the Canadian immigration department\u2019s Special Events Liaison Unit. But these steps were insufficient. In May 2024, the IHEA board took the difficult decision to shift the conference to Bali, Indonesia. While looking for a new location, our main concern was finding a country with a more permissive visa regime than Canada\u2019s. However, we also needed support from a strong local organizing committee and a venue big enough to accommodate our group.\n\nWe have been thinking more carefully about geographical equity and the convenience of our members, who are distributed around the globe. In the past, the meeting mainly alternated between Europe and North America, although we have held it once in China and once in Australia, and the last congress was held in South Africa \u2014 attracting participants from 106 countries.\n\n\u2018Exhausted and insulted\u2019: how harsh visa-application policies are hobbling global research\n\nWe\u2019ve now learnt that we need to consider visa equity, too. Meaningful academic discourse is not possible if important conferences are a venue only for those who can travel with relative ease. An informed global dialogue on crucial issues, such as health economics and policy, requires contributions from a diverse group of participants.\n\nTo our relief, there was no backlash from our membership when the decision to shift the venue was announced. On the contrary, we received e-mails from colleagues all over the world thanking the IHEA for its action, and for recognizing the challenges faced by researchers from low- and middle-income countries, who tend to have the greatest problems obtaining a visa.\n\nBut this is not just a problem of rich nations versus poorer ones \u2014 although visa constraints in Europe, Canada and the United States are widely recognized as onerous, some low- and middle-income countries also impose restrictions. For instance, visa denials affecting many participants at the Health Systems Research symposium in Bogot\u00e1 in 2022 led some researchers to boycott the event.\n\nVisa discrimination \u2014 unfair or differential treatment of individuals based on nationality or other characteristics \u2014 is clearly at the root of the problem. But conference organizers are not always sensitive to such discrimination.",

(hapabapa via Getty Images)\n\nThe fate of the H-1B program \u2013 which offers U.S. employers a way to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty occupations \u2013 has divided influential Republicans. Tech leaders like Elon Musk strongly support the program, while other Republicans question its impact on American workers. President Donald Trump imposed restrictions on the program in his first term, but his current policy agenda on H-1Bs remains under discussion.\n\nMeanwhile, bipartisan calls for H-1B reforms advocate for more oversight to protect American workers while addressing skill shortages.\n\nThe number of H-1B applications approved in recent years has climbed. Nearly 400,000 were approved in fiscal year 2024, most of which were applications to renew employment. Rejection rates of H-1B applications spiked during Trump\u2019s first term but fell under former President Joe Biden.\n\nHere are some key facts about the H-1B program and its workers. These findings come from government data, some of which we received through a public records request.\n\nHow we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to learn more about H-1B workers in the United States. The analysis used three sources: Data received through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Office of Performance and Quality. This source provides data on foreign workers whose H-1B applications were approved each fiscal year from 2000 to 2023. We used this to compile data on the number of approved applications and workers\u2019 country of birth, educational attainment, occupation and median annual salary. Data from this FOIA request was received Sept. 20, 2024. USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub . This source provides data on the total number of H-1B applications from fiscal 2009 to 2024. We used this to compile data on the number of approved applications, the denial rate for H-1B applications, the most common H-1B employers and the geographic location of H-1B approvals. 2023 American Community Survey (ACS). This source provides data on the U.S. population as of July 1, 2023. We used this to compile data on the geographic location of U.S. workers to compare with H-1B approvals. The 2023 ACS was provided through IPUMS from the University of Minnesota and published Census Bureau tables . In this analysis, the term \u201cH-1B worker\u201d refers to foreign workers whose H-1B applications were approved in a given fiscal year. We use this term interchangeably with \u201cH-1B approval\u201d and \u201capproved H-1B application.\u201d Fiscal years end on Sept. 30 of the designated year. The data for approvals only includes applications whose first decision from USCIS is an approval. Not all workers with approved H-1B applications hold H-1B visas. Foreign workers can legally work in the U.S. once USCIS has issued an approved H-1B application. If the worker is located outside the U.S., they can then use their approved application to apply for an H-1B visa from the State Department to enter the U.S. legally. Notably, the data does not provide a comprehensive picture of all H-1B workers in the country at any given time. Rather, they show approvals (and denials) in a given fiscal year. H-1B approvals are typically valid for three years, so there are H-1B workers in the U.S. in a given year whose applications are not part of that year\u2019s data. Employers submit H-1B \u201cnew applications\u201d for initial employment; these are for workers who are applying to work for the given employer and do not already have H-1B approval. These are known as applications for \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cnew concurrent\u201d employment. H-1B \u201crenewal applications\u201d are for continuing employment; they are submitted for workers who are renewing their H-1B approval and continue working with the same employer either in the same or a different position, begin working for a different employer, or have some other change in their application. Applications for continuing employment are usually filed for noncitizens already in the U.S. In this analysis, application totals include both new and renewal applications. \u201cDenied applications\u201d refer to H-1B applications that were denied in a given fiscal year. \u201cDenial rates\u201d are the share of applications denied. The data for denials only includes applications whose first decision from USCIS is a denial. The analysis of H-1B workers\u2019 country of birth follows country classifications from the 2023 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics nonimmigrant admissions by region and country of citizenship (Table 26). The geographic location of H-1B approvals is based on the ZIP code of the employer. The data does not include the individual H-1B worker\u2019s location, which could be at the employer location or elsewhere. We assigned ZIP codes to metropolitan areas using the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ZIP-CBSA crosswalk. ZIP codes sometimes cross metro areas, so ZIP codes that belong to multiple metro areas were assigned to the area with the highest ratio of businesses. To calculate the number of H-1B approvals per 100 workers in each metro area, we used data from the 2023 ACS provided by IPUMS. For metropolitan areas not defined in the IPUMS data, we used data from published Census Bureau tables (Table B24060). Metro areas are based on the 2023 delineations from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Proportions are calculated from unrounded numbers.\n\nWhat is the H-1B visa program? The H-1B program was created by the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers on a temporary basis in jobs that require highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, or its equivalent, in a related specialty. To participate, an employer must apply to the U.S. Department of Labor. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) then reviews the application. If approved, the prospective worker can legally work in the United States. If the worker is located outside the U.S., they may apply for an interview with the U.S. State Department, which, if successful, leads to the issuance of a visa. H-1B approvals are valid for three years and may be extended for a maximum of six years. If an employer is sponsoring a worker for U.S. permanent residency, the H-1B approval may be extended for more than six years. Since 2005, H-1B approvals for new employment have been capped at 65,000 per year, with an additional 20,000 approvals reserved for foreign workers who have advanced degrees from U.S. colleges and universities. If the number of applications exceeds the caps, USCIS uses a lottery system to process and approve applications. Some employers are exempted from the caps, including universities and colleges, nonprofits and government research institutions. Renewal applications for continued employment are also not subject to the caps.\n\nAbout 400,000 H-1B applications for high-skilled foreign workers were approved in 2024. That\u2019s more than twice the number of applications approved in fiscal 2000. Approvals peaked in 2022, when 442,425 applications were approved.\n\nSince 2013, the majority of approvals each year have been applications to renew employment. In 2024, 65% of approved applications, or 258,196, were renewals. The other 35%, or 141,207, were new applications for initial employment.\n\nNew applications are for workers who are applying to work for a given employer and do not already have H-1B approval. These include applications from employers that are subject to the annual cap of 85,000 approvals and employers that are exempt from the cap.\n\nRenewal applications are for workers to continue their H-1B approval, either with their current employer or with a different employer. They are usually filed for noncitizens who are already in the United States. Applications for renewed employment are not subject to the annual caps. (Refer to \u201cWhat is the H-1B visa program?\u201d for more information.)\n\nH-1B denial rates dropped to 2% in 2022 \u2013 a low since 2009. Denial rates peaked at 15% in fiscal 2018, during Trump\u2019s first administration. That included 24% of new applications for initial employment and 12% of renewal applications for continuing employment. The Trump administration implemented stricter immigration rules, including tightening the definition of \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d and limiting third-party placements of H-1B workers.\n\nUnder Biden, the denial rate dropped to under 3%, in part due to court rulings against the restrictions from Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nWhat do Americans think about legal immigration? About 40% of U.S. adults say high-skilled workers should be given top priority for legal immigration. Additionally, about 60% of voters say that legal immigrants fill jobs that U.S. citizens don\u2019t want, according to an August 2024 Pew Research Center survey. Read more about Americans\u2019 views on legal immigration priorities and immigrant workers.\n\nIndia is the top country of birth for H-1B workers. Roughly three-quarters (73%) of H-1B workers whose applications were approved in fiscal 2023 were born in India. A majority of approvals every year since 2010 have gone to workers born in India.\n\nChina is the second-most common birthplace, accounting for 12% of H-1B workers approved in 2023.\n\nNo other birthplace accounted for even 2% of H-1B workers approved in 2023.\n\nThe share of H-1B workers whose highest degree is a master\u2019s increased from 31% in 2000 to 57% in 2021. On the other hand, the share whose highest degree is a bachelor\u2019s decreased from 57% to 34%.\n\nThe share with a doctorate has varied between 6% and 13%, and the share with a professional degree (such as a J.D. or M.D.) has ranged between 2% and 6%.\n\nH-1B applicants must work in occupations that require specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor\u2019s degree or its equivalent. In recent years, government agencies have updated rules clarifying the definition of \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d and their degree requirements.\n\nComputer-related jobs have been the most common occupation for H-1B workers for more than a decade. Since fiscal 2012, about 60% or more of H-1B workers approved each year have held a computer-related job. In 2023, the share was 65%, and these workers reported a median annual salary of $123,600. Examples of these include jobs in systems analysis and programming, computer systems technical support, and data communications and networks.\n\nThe next largest job group for H-1B workers approved in 2023 is architecture, engineering and surveying (9%). Workers in these jobs reported a median annual salary of $115,000. Examples of these include jobs in electrical or electronics engineering, mechanical engineering, and industrial engineering.\n\nAmazon has been the employer with the most H-1B workers approved each year since 2020. Amazon received more than 11,000 H-1B approvals in fiscal 2023. This accounts for 3% of all H-1B applications approved that year.\n\nMany of the other top employers provide information technology and business services, including Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Google.\n\nIn 2023, three of the top 10 H-1B employers were either headquartered in India (Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services) or originated in India and are now headquartered in the U.S. (Cognizant Technology Solutions). This is a decline from 2016, when six of the top 10 companies had ties to India.\n\nNew York far outpaces other metropolitan areas in the number of H-1B applications approved in 2023. More than 55,000 approvals went to employers there. The Washington, D.C., and San Jose, California, metro areas had the next-highest totals, with more than 30,000 approvals each.\n\nThe geographic location of H-1B approvals is based on the location of the employer. The data does not include individual H-1B workers\u2019 locations, which could be the employer location or elsewhere.\n\nCollege Station, Texas, is the metropolitan area with the highest concentration of H-1B approvals. Employers based in and around College Station received about seven H-1B approvals per 100 workers in fiscal year 2023. No other metro area received more than four approvals per 100 workers.\n\nOther areas with high concentrations of H-1B approvals include San Jose, California (three approvals per 100 workers) and Trenton, New Jersey (two approvals per 100 workers).\n\nCollege Station was also the top metro area from 2010 to 2016, when it had 32 H-1B approvals per 100 workers. Notably, the U.S. headquarters of Cognizant Technology Solutions, the most common employer for H-1B workers in 2016, was previously in College Station before more recently moving to the New York metro area.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nAccording to the Business Formation Statistics for the year 2024, the United States continues to be the pivot of business activity, with millions of businesses operating across the country. As more businesses expand into the country, it is essential for foreign companies to make sure they are compliant with all visa requirements to ensure they can continue operating in the United Staes. For example, if a business intends to expand overseas operations to the United States and wants to transfer an executive or manager from a foreign office to the U.S. entity, they may consider filing for an L-1 \u201cnew Office\u201d visa.\n\nWhat is an L-1 \u2018New Office\u2019 Visa?\n\nThe L-1 \u201cnew office\u201d visa allows businesses to begin their operations in the U.S. by sending their overseas company\u2019s high-level managers or executives through the newly formed U.S. entity. These key personnel can come to the U.S. for an initial period of one year to develop and foster the business\u2019s operations in the new market.\n\nEligibility and Requirements\n\nU.S. immigration regulations define a \u201cnew office\u201d as an organization that has been doing business in the United States through a parent, branch, affiliate or subsidiary for less than one year. Since the new office must conduct business, the mere presence of an agent or office is not sufficient to satisfy the regulations, and it must be shown that the company is engaged in the regular, systematic and continuous provisions of goods and/or services.\n\nThe US company/Petitioner must satisfy following requirements to qualify for a \u201cnew Office\u201d L-1 visa:\n\nThe employer has secured sufficient physical premises to house the new office.\n\nThe employee has been employed as an executive or manager for one continuous year in the three years preceding the filing of the petition with the overseas entity; and\n\nThe intended U.S. office will support an executive or managerial position within one year of the approval of the petition.\n\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(l)(3)(v) for details.\n\nSufficient physical premises\n\nThe U.S. company must secure sufficient physical premises for the new office at the time of filing the Petition with the USCIS. It is also necessary to secure an office space that is large enough to support the U.S. company\u2019s business and planned growth during the first year.\n\nThe petitioner must present evidence proving they have acquired office space that meets all the guidelines. This should include a copy of the signed lease or sale deed to the premises if the U.S. premises are owned or being purchased. Additionally, businesses must submit colored photographs showing the inside and outside of all office space, equipment, merchandise, products, company logos etc. The Petitioner may lease a co-working space, as long as it is sufficient enough to accommodate Petitioner\u2019s to be hired employees for the first year and they have confirmation from the Lessor to make the additional space available to the company as and when needed.\n\nOne Year employment with overseas entity\n\nThe Petitioner must demonstrate that the Beneficiary was employed with its qualifying overseas entity for at least one year in a managerial or executive or specialized knowledge capacity. The overseas entity must be actively doing business for one year or more and should be related to the petitioner in a qualifying relationship as parent-subsidiary or affiliate. The Petitioner must provide sufficient evidence to establish that the Beneficiary is employed with the entity in managerial or executive or specialized knowledge capacity.\n\nThe Petitioner must be able to demonstrate that the Beneficiary will be actively involved in day-to-day operations during the initial phases of the business. It must also be shown that the individual has the authority and plans to hire staff and other managerial freedoms, such as a wide latitude in making decisions about the goals and management of the organization. The Petitioner must establish that it can support the beneficiary in the requisite managerial, executive, or specialized knowledge position within one year of approval. At the time an extension is filed, USCIS will closely scrutinize the petition to determine whether this has occurred, and to verify that the petitioner has followed through with the timetable and plans submitted in the original \u201cnew office\u201d L-1 petition.\n\nBusiness plan, financial projections, and personnel plan\n\nA detailed and extensive business plan is also required with a \u201cnew office\u201d L-1 petition, as USCIS places an emphasis on the company\u2019s short- and long-term goals and projections when adjudicating the initial petition and future extensions.\n\nThe business plan should begin with an explanation supporting the need for the new office in the U.S., which may include a SWOT analysis. It should demonstrate the proposed business actions the Petitioner is planning to execute throughout the first year of its business and thereafter. The Business shall include the Petitioner\u2019s financial projections, hiring, costing, marketing and sales plan. It should also explain how the financial projects were derived and whether the calculations were based on realistic and credible assumptions using current assets, growth revenues, and other similar projection calculation tools.\n\nThe Petitioner\u2019s hiring plan should exhibit the total number of employees the Petitioner intends to hire in the first year and in the upcoming years. It should specifically include the job titles, brief job descriptions, approximate salaries, etc. of all the to be hired positions.\n\nL-1 New Office Period of Stay\n\nThe Beneficiary entering the United States to establish a new office will be allowed a maximum initial stay of one year. For all L-1A employees, requests for extension of stay may be granted in increments of up to an additional two years, until the employee has reached the maximum limit of seven years.\n\nConclusion",

(NYSE:V) stands against other best stocks to invest in from conservative stock portfolio.\n\nLatest reports indicate that hedge funds have been dumping the shares of technology and media companies at the fastest rate in the past six months. For those who mimic the investing strategy of hedge funds for maximum financial gains, this is cause for alarm. The dumping of tech and media firms by billionaires suggests that it is time for investors to consider pouring their money into more conservative stocks to balance portfolios against riskier growth options. These conservative stocks, also sometimes called blue-chip stocks, are well-established companies with a history of stable earnings, reliable dividends, and strong market positions. These stocks are typically less volatile, making them appealing to risk-averse investors seeking steady growth and income. However, recent developments in the global economy and political landscape may influence the performance and attractiveness of conservative stocks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nProminent analysts are also optimistic about the success of conservative stocks this year. For example, per a report published by finance news platform Barron\u2019s, investment bank Stifel predicts that the S&P 500, which gained 28% in 2024 to reach 6,084 points, may face a correction to the mid-5,000s. Barry Bannister, the Chief Equity Strategist at the bank, attributed the anticipated downturn to slowing GDP growth, persistent inflation, and potential disruptions from the Trump administration. To navigate this expected turbulence, Stifel recommended investing in conservative stocks less vulnerable to economic swings. Similar observations were made recently by Bill Stone from Glenview Trust, who recommended investing in conservative stocks from the healthcare and consumer-staples sectors for 2025.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database and picked 10 conservative (safe, reliable and defensive) stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

            "content": "Hundreds of overseas PhD candidates have paid the Australian government more than half a million dollars to process visa applications that appear to have been frozen indefinitely by a computer glitch.\n\nMore than 400 doctoral candidates from China, India, Pakistan, South Korea, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are said to have been afflicted by the \u201c1221 bug\u201d, which halts all progress on visa processing after applicants have been instructed to provide \u201cadditional personal particulars\u201d by filling out \u201cForm 1221\u201d.\n\nApplicants say that when they complete the online form, the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) computer system fails to recognise that it has been submitted. Resubmission of the form produces the same result.\n\nA doctoral candidate from India, who asked not to be named, said no applicant affected by the bug had ever been granted a visa. Australian student visa application charges are A$1,600 (\u00a3783), the highest in the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA DHA spokesman said the department was \u201cnot aware of any systems or technical issues impacting a visa applicant\u2019s ability to attach documents\u201d in its ImmiAccount visa management system. \u201cA visa cannot be granted until the department is satisfied that all requirements have been met,\u201d he added.\n\nScreenshots obtained by Times Higher Education show that students have been given \u201cyellow flags\u201d, indicating that DHA assessments are pending. Applicants are directed to \u201ccomplete character assessment information\u201d or \u201cstart a new Form 1221\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cStudents already uploaded Form 1221 but the system asked them to upload again,\u201d an applicant calling herself Elika Zhang explained in a 2022 submission to Australia\u2019s migration review. \u201cThey received no email notifications from visa officers. No students who have been marked [with the] 1221 bug this year have been issued visas.\u201d\n\nThe apparent glitch is among the difficulties plaguing an estimated 1,000 doctoral candidates from seven countries who are comparing notes after waiting months or years for their visa applications to be processed.\n\nThey say they have put their lives on hold and spent thousands of dollars on visa applications and medical checks, only to find themselves in limbo. Some doctoral candidates are \u201cspending the best few years of their life\u201d waiting as much as 36 months for their visas, Zhang said.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to understand why the Australian government and universities are providing funding for outstanding international students to support their research in Australia, but DHA is then forbidding\u2026them from entering Australia,\u201d notes a petition to federal government ministers.\n\nThe petition says DHA should have \u201cclear deadlines for visa processing\u201d, with students updated regularly on the progress of their applications, and universities barred from offering positions to candidates that the department does not \u201clike\u201d.\n\n\u201cRefund the application fee if you can\u2019t make [a] decision,\u201d the petition adds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPhD visa processing delays have persisted for years despite dozens of media reports in Times Higher Education and elsewhere dating back as far as 2018.\n\nRecent DHA statistics suggest that 99 per cent of postgraduate research visa applications lodged offshore prove successful, and half are processed within 20 days. But these figures do not include applications put on hold indefinitely while they are scrutinised by security agencies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe doctoral candidate from India said she and many compatriots had been waiting 10 or more months \u201cwithout any communication from the department\u201d. Enquiries about the delays elicited replies saying the \u201cnecessary health, character, and national security clearances\u201d could take \u201cseveral months\u201d or \u201cup to two years\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that the department can do to expedite the process,\u201d one reply says. \u201cWe are unable to provide you with a definitive timeframe,\u201d says another.\n\nShe said that the information DHA requested via Form 1221 had already been supplied by visa applicants in their original paperwork. Some had also been instructed to complete Form 80, which covered much of the same ground.\n\n\u201cMany of us have lost our scholarships this month as the universities cannot\u2026carry forward the scholarships and enrolments,\u201d she said. \u201cMarch begins a new fiscal year for many universities.\u201d\n\nA Chinese doctoral candidate said about 400 countryfolk had been awaiting visas for up to 30 months. In a February petition, a group of Chinese PhD students asked their country\u2019s ambassador to Australia to lobby for fairer and more transparent visa processing processes.\n\n\u201cSince early 2024, students who encountered the \u20181221 bug\u2019 have almost never received their visas and are still waiting indefinitely,\u201d the petition says.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDHA said factors influencing visa processing time frames included \u201cwhether the applicant has submitted\u2026all necessary supporting documents\u201d and \u201chow quickly an applicant responds to any requests for additional information\u201d.\n\njohn.ross@timeshighereducation.com",

            "content": "Visa executives called out commercial payments and ancillary services as areas with expansion opportunities, as consumer card growth ebbs in some places, including the U.S.\n\nVisa CEO Ryan McInerney presented the potential growth opportunities in his first investor day presentation since taking the company\u2019s top post in 2023 and assembling his executive team.\n\nVisa\u2019s \u201cdeep bench was on display as was an evolution of its strategy toward unbundling solutions to enhance growth prospects, via Visa-as-a-Service, a product of its technological transformation begun a decade ago,\u201d analysts for investment firm TD Cowen said of the investor day presentation in a Feb. 23 note to clients.\n\nThe TD Cowen analysts also noted Visa\u2019s goal to increase revenue from that VAS effort, and other new payment flows, to half of its revenue, up from 30% last year, in an unspecified timeframe.\n\nWhile McInerney pointed to sizable opportunities remaining in Visa\u2019s flagship consumer card payments arena, he also emphasized extensive additional runway in the commercial card and value added services.\n\n\u201cWe are now unbundling the Visa stack and taking these component solutions and offering them to a much broader array of customers,\u201d McInerney said during the Feb. 20 investor day webcast.\n\nAbout 70% of the company\u2019s revenue is driven by its core payments business, but that is changing, analysts at the investment firm William Blair said in a Feb. 24 note. \u201cWe believe this transformation, strong internal execution, and technology investment will enable Visa to achieve its financial framework of 9%-12% revenue growth, driven by 5%-7% consumer payments expansion and 16%-18% Commercial and Money Movement (CMS) plus [Visa-as-a-service] growth,\u201d they said in the note.\n\nThe San Francisco company, with 31,600 employees in 85 countries, is extending its services from its core card network clientele that has been the foundation of its business for 67 years. Beyond consumer payment credit, debit and prepaid card services, the company is adding account-to-account services, consulting services, fraud prevention options and cross-border payments worldwide, among other services.\n\nLast year, Visa handled about $16 trillion in payments through about 300 billion transactions, according to its investor presentation deck.\n\nStill, McInerney acknowledged growing competition from fintechs, including digital wallets, payment alternatives such as buy now, pay later tools, and cryptocurrency options, such as stablecoins. He noted the company is increasingly locking arms with some of those upstart rivals.\n\nVisa\u2019s ebbing dominance in the card market is evidenced to some extent by the slowing rate of growth in its home market. While Visa is the largest network in the U.S., followed by Mastercard, it is only the second-largest in the world, behind China\u2019s UnionPay International.\n\nCredit, debit and prepaid card activity worldwide will climb 43% to nearly 1.11 trillion transactions by 2029, relative to 2024, research firm Nilson Report predicted last month, with the biggest increase in the Asia-Pacific region (46.8%) and the smallest increase in the U.S. (27%), according to Nilson.\n\nVisa estimated that last year it captured roughly one quarter of the $41 trillion worldwide consumer payments market, excluding China and Russia, which are dominated by domestic systems, according to the company\u2019s presentation. That leaves about three-quarters of that commerce \u2014 currently transacted in card payments, paper checks, ACH payments, account-to-account payments and other instruments \u2014 as potentially ripe for the taking, Visa\u2019s executives asserted.\n\nWith respect to commercial card payments, business-to-business transactions and other electronic money movement, Visa estimated that it snared only about $1.7 trillion of the $200-trillion market last year. The company also sees that as a major growth target, given opportunities in evolving peer-to-peer payments and virtual card payments as well as increasing digitization of accounts receivable and accounts payable segments.\n\nMcInerney emphasized the card network is opening more to allow developers to build off its systems, tapping into digital wallets and linking with other peers to build its VisaNet network-of-networks. Visa has also created its own stablecoin services.\n\nVisa executives also contend that there\u2019s room to expand in the value-added arena, where opportunities lie in a variety of software services, from issuing and acceptance to risk management and security. Visa\u2019s $8.8 billion in revenue in that realm last year was minuscule relative to the $520 billion total addressable market, the presentation showed.\n\nAside from competition, the company also faces other regulatory obstacles that were less discussed during the presentation. Specifically, the Justice Department is suing the company over what the U.S. government alleges are antitrust violations in the U.S. debit card market. Federal prosecutors last year alleged the company illegally co-opted some fintech rivals as part of its monopolistic control of the industry.\n\nIn addition, some Congress members are intent on establishing more laws to rein in the industry. Specifically, Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who serves as the whip for his party, plans to reintroduce a bill that would require banks that issue credit cards to ensure that alternatives to Visa and Mastercard are presented to merchants for routing transactions.\n\nAlso, the unlikely Senate duo of independent Sen. Bernie Saunders and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley have proposed to cap interest rates on credit cards at 10% for five years.",

            "content": "Foreign students say the threat of Trump's executive orders is getting real\n\ntoggle caption John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nIt was billed as a \"Palestine Night\" gala and fundraiser, with proceeds going to families in Gaza. At the campus student center at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, students in traditional Palestinian red and black robes mingled with others amid tables selling jewelry and keffiyeh head coverings, a photo booth and prayer mats.\n\nThe annual event, put on by Students for Justice in Palestine, is usually a big draw, but this year, more than a few students were nervous about showing up.\n\n\"I was scared that I would get photographed or something, and that would cause a problem,\" said one foreign student in the U.S. who asked that her name not be used for fear of jeopardizing her visa. \"My dad knows that I am very pro-Palestine, and he was like, be very careful, like you don't want to take any risks.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe risks for foreign students have heightened dramatically since President Trump's recent executive orders cracking down on those deemed to be supporting U.S.-designated terrorist groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah, and the directives already appear to be chilling political activism.\n\nOne order targets foreigners who \"threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology\" or \"support designated foreign terrorists.\" A second order meant to combat antisemitism specifically targets \"Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.\" Both call for strict enforcement of existing immigration laws that bar visas for any such foreigners.\n\n\"To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice,\" Trump said. \"We will find you, and we will deport you.\"\n\nAbed Ayoub, head of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the threat is getting real. He says the ADC has heard from at least a dozen students who left the U.S. for winter break and were unable to return because their visas were canceled \u2014 with no explanation given.\n\n\"Two of them have no involvement at all with student activism on campus. They just happened to be from Gaza,\" Ayoub says. \"This should be a concern of all Americans because this opens the door to really criminalizing any speech and any expression in the nation.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAsked for confirmation that visas were canceled, a State Department spokesperson said they could not comment because of confidentiality laws. The spokesperson said that \"the State Department generally revokes visas when information comes to light indicating that an applicant may no longer be eligible for the visa under U.S. immigration laws, including when an applicant poses a threat to U.S. public safety and national security.\"\n\nSome students welcome the orders, saying any student who crosses the line from pro-Palestinian advocacy to supporting terrorist groups is not acceptable on campus. And they say it's too early to say that any crackdown will prove to be an overreach. But others are fearful, lying low for the moment and skipping events and protests or showing up anyway, with trepidation, like the student at the \"Palestine Night\" event who asked that her name not be used.\n\n\"I feel like college is a time when we should be able to speak freely,\" she said. \"I've been raised with the values that I should be vocal about what I believe in, so it almost feels like I'm lying to myself when I can't say what I feel.\"\n\nTrump's order on antisemitism calls on schools to monitor their foreign students and staff \u2014 and report those who are \"Hamas sympathizers\" or \"pro-jihadist,\" as Trump put it. Schools contacted by NPR declined to comment on how they will comply with the directive, or said only that they're still reviewing it.\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Israel groups say they're receiving a growing number of tips accusing campus activists of supporting U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.\n\n\n\n\"One of my friends \u2026 was texting me frantically\"\n\nIt's all fueling concerns that \"support\" will be over-broadly interpreted and authorities will be cracking down even on peaceful protesters, the majority of whom are focused on human rights and divestment. Many students worry that Trump's orders are a thinly veiled attempt to silence any pro-Palestinian advocacy.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"Their main target is anyone who supports Palestine in any way shape or form,\" says another student, an American citizen born to Palestinian parents, who asked not to be named for fear of harassment. He says his friends on student visas are terrified that even an old post or photo could come back to haunt them.\n\n\"One of my friends actually was texting me frantically\" in the middle of the night, he recalls. \"His face was in one of those posts, and he was texting me, 'Can we get this post removed?' And that kind of hit me, this is serious.\"\n\nSome college newspapers are hearing the same concerns, so much so that the student newspaper at Purdue University, The Purdue Exponent, decided to give blanket anonymity to all students at all pro-Palestinian protests. The paper even scrubbed all protesters' names and photos from its archives, explaining that it \"refuses to be party to such a blatant violation of the First Amendment rights.\"\n\nOther students, however, have denounced the paper's new policy, saying that'll make it tougher to hold protesters accountable and to restore safety and stability to campuses.\n\n\"I think that's wrong,\" says Sabrina Soffer, a pro-Israel student at George Washington University. \"It's like when [protesters] wear masks. It's just another way to put another obstacle in the way of holding students accountable.\"\n\nOf course, Soffer says, implementation of the executive orders must be thoughtful and judicious. \"Being pro-Palestinian is not being pro-jihad,\" she says. \"But at the same time, we have to be scrupulous enough to make sure that those who really are a threat and who are connected to these terrorist organizations are the ones held accountable.\"\n\nMaia Shteyman, a pro-Israel student from UMass Amherst, agrees. Students demanding humanitarian aid in Gaza, criticizing Israel or waving a Palestinian flag, for example, are not the issue, Shteyman says. But, she says, she's seen some protesters openly supporting U.S.-labeled terrorist groups on her campus, and that needs to be addressed.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"They were wearing Hamas-like uniforms, with the headbands, and there were intifada signs everywhere [saying] 'Go Hamas,' and pro-Hamas stuff. They were just saying this stuff straight up to our face,\" Shteyman says.\n\n\"I think it's much more common that you might imagine, that there are people actually coordinating with Hamas, that they are acting as the PR agents of Hamas,\" says attorney Mark Goldfeder, director of the National Jewish Advocacy Center. He has filed a federal lawsuit alleging direct ties between student groups and U.S.-designated terrorist organizations, and some protesters' explicit support for them.\n\n\"They are saying, 'We are Hamas and we want to do these things,' \" Goldfeder says. \"It behooves us to believe them and to take precautions for our national security. It is genuinely dangerous. And you don't even have to like the Jews to worry about it because they're coming for the United States, as well.\"\n\n\n\nDeportation attempts are likely to wind up in court\n\nUltimately, any effort to deport a student for protest activity is all but certain to be challenged in court.\n\n\"The government would have a huge First Amendment hurdle to overcome if it sought to go after someone for their pure speech,\" says David Cole, Georgetown Law professor and former national legal director with the American Civil Liberties Union. \"If it were enforced, it would be, I believe, struck down.\"\n\nOthers take a different view. Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow and director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, is also a staunch free speech proponent. But in this case, he says, \"It's not about policing or prosecuting speech, it's about enforcing immigration regulations, and immigration regulations say that if you espouse support for certain groups that are inimical to the American interest, then you don't get a visa, or if you're here already then your visa gets revoked.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Palestinian students are left contemplating their risk. Some, like a 27-year-old graduate student from the West Bank, who asked that his name not be used for fear of being targeted, says he will continue to speak out.\n\n\"I mean, my people are being slaughtered there and dehumanized,\" he says. \"I'm not going to just sit down there and just be afraid of speaking out, no matter what the consequences are.\"\n\nStill, he did reach out to a free-speech advocacy group to make sure he's got help lined up just in case, as he put it, someone wants to \"get rid of\" him.",

            "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to lure wealthy immigrants to the U.S. with a \u201cgold card\u201d program could drive up home prices and worsen America\u2019s housing-affordability crisis, according to real-estate experts and people who\u2019ve studied similar immigration incentives in Europe.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed program would provide immigrants who invest at least $5 million in the U.S. with a path toward citizenship. There are similar programs currently in place in the U.S., but they come with a smaller price tag. Trump said it\u2019s possible the program could attract 10 million \u201chighly productive people\u201d and generate enough revenue to pay down the national debt.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough details on what type of investments would be required through the gold-card program are still scarce, experts who have studied existing citizenship and residence-by-investment programs in more than 100 countries say that if wealthy foreign investors can invest in real estate to qualify for the visa, that could directly push up home prices in the U.S.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment about the program and its potential impact on residential real estate.\n\nWhen foreign investors buy up residential real estate, particularly in city centers, \u201cthat overheats the real-estate market and makes it very hard for the locals to live where they used to live,\u201d Basil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner at Henley & Partners North America \u2014 a firm that advises wealthy individuals who want to participate in citizenship-by-investment programs \u2014 told MarketWatch. That\u2019s led some countries to modify their citizenship-by-investment programs to be less focused on real estate.\n\nCould home prices shoot up in a similar way in the U.S. with the introduction of Trump\u2019s gold-card program? Potentially, experts say. Even if Trump\u2019s program is not specifically centered around real-estate investment, home prices could go up if it is implemented \u2014 because it\u2019s theoretically ultrarich individuals who have the capacity to spend $5 million for the visa, Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told MarketWatch.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that if they can come up with $5 million, they probably have a little extra to buy real estate,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it will bring about more demand in the ultra-high end of the real-estate market.\u201d\n\nHow \u2018golden visa\u2019 programs work\n\nSo-called golden visa programs exist in many parts of the globe \u2014 from the Caribbean to the Middle East, throughout Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region, including in Australia and Hong Kong.\n\nAll these programs operate under the same principle: Foreign investors invest capital into a specific fund that a nation sets up to pay for some objective, and they\u2019re rewarded with legal residency and sometimes even citizenship in that country.\n\nThe term \u201cgolden visa\u201d is a marketing phrase that refers to visa programs that allow investors to skip the often lengthy and arduous process of attaining legal residency in another country, Mohr-Elzeki said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the programs differ widely in structure.\n\nSome countries allow foreign capital investment to go toward investing in local businesses. New Zealand, for instance, has an Active Investor Plus Visa that requires a minimum investment of $2.8 million (NZD 5 million) into unlisted New Zealand businesses over the course of four years, in exchange for permanent residency.\n\nSome programs allow foreign capital investment in real estate in exchange for residency; this has been an attractive option for many investors. Many wealthier Americans, for instance, have used these programs to move abroad in search of a lower cost of living, lower taxes, a better quality of life and other perks. Americans typically go to Europe or the Caribbean, Mohr-Elzeki said, and are often looking for passports that offer a hedge against geopolitical risk.\n\nFor example, investors can buy real estate in Greece in exchange for residency in that country and visa-free travel across the 29 countries that make up the Schengen Area in Europe. They can also rent out the investment property to generate extra income.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Golden visa\u2019 programs have helped drive up home prices in some countries\n\nThese citizenship-by-investment programs have created ripple effects in some countries\u2019 housing markets \u2014 sometimes with negative consequences for local residents.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Portugal, the nation\u2019s search for foreign capital in the aftermath of the global financial crisis inadvertently made real-estate more expensive for locals. Joao Pereira dos Santos, an academic at the University of Lisbon who co-authored the paper \u201cAll That Glitters? Golden Visas and Real Estate,\u201d told MarketWatch that the golden visa program was one factor that drove up high-end property prices in Portugal, according to his analysis of transaction data.\n\nWhen Portugal\u2019s program was put in place in 2012, the nation offered residency in exchange for investment, primarily in real estate, for a minimum amount of 500,000 euros.\n\nThe local real-estate market was depressed, but \u201cfor people who bought a house in 2012, 2013, 2014, this was a very good deal,\u201d dos Santos said. \u201cIn less than 10 years, house prices doubled in Portugal, especially in more [tourist-friendly] areas and urban centers like Lisbon.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of applications later, the co-authors found that there was a significant increase in properties sold at that price, suggesting that home sellers were strategically pricing their properties at that figure to satisfy the golden visa\u2019s requirements for investors. That led to a \u201cdistortion\u201d in the real-estate market, the authors said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile the golden visa scheme has been successful in attracting foreign investment, it has also led to unintended consequences in the real-estate market, including price distortions and public disapproval, particularly in urban areas like Lisbon,\u201d they added.\n\nThe argument is not that the golden visa program itself directly drove up home prices, dos Santos said, but rather that it was part of a broader set of programs that attracted money and created demand for homes from high-net-worth individuals \u2014 and with supply not keeping up, prices rose.\n\nThe same dynamic of foreign money driving up home prices played out in Spain, which has more than four times the population of Portugal. A sharp increase in property prices for Spanish citizens led the nation to stop issuing golden visas to foreigners buying homes last year.\n\n\u201cToday, 94 out of every 100 such visas are linked to real-estate investment \u2026 in major cities that are facing a highly stressed market and where it\u2019s almost impossible to find decent housing for those who already live, work and pay their taxes there,\u201d Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said at the time, Reuters reported.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Greece, rent prices and real-estate sales shot up after the country started its golden visa program, Euronews reported. Prices have gone up so much that permanent residents haven\u2019t been able to buy houses, Themistoklis Bakas, chief executive of E-Real Estates Network, a property portal, told Euronews.\n\nTrump\u2019s gold card proposal comes as the U.S. housing market is already facing a crisis of unaffordability. Many would-be home buyers are shut out of the housing market as home prices have soared to record highs and mortgage rates hover around 7%. The average worker in the U.S. does not make sufficient income to afford a median-priced home, as seen by the big gap in affordability in this chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\n\nReforming immigration has been a key focus for the Trump administration, and on the campaign trail, Trump and running mate J.D. Vance claimed illegal immigration was one of the drivers of high housing costs.\n\nIn September, Trump said he would ease housing affordability by banning mortgages for undocumented immigrants, though such mortgages are rarely issued. In the vice-presidential debate in October, Vance said that housing has become \u201ctotally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.\u201d\n\nSome \u2018golden visa\u2019 programs don\u2019t allow real-estate investment\n\nSome countries with golden visa programs have made it clear that their real estate is not up for sale \u2014 though they still want to attract foreign money.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanada offers residency for investors with startup ideas under its \u201cStart-up Visa Program.\u201d But the nation, which is also dealing with a dire housing-affordability crisis, banned foreigners from buying homes last year.\n\nSimilarly, in New Zealand, foreigners haven\u2019t been allowed to buy homes unless they\u2019re approved by the government since 2018 \u2014 though that rule could be relaxed, according to local media reports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for a foreigner to buy property in New Zealand,\u201d Dominic Jones, head of Greener Pastures New Zealand, which advises on investment residency in the nation, told MarketWatch. Instead, one can obtain permanent residency in New Zealand with an investment into other asset categories such as bonds or stocks, he noted.\n\nAnother way the \u2018gold card\u2019 program could affect housing prices\n\nThe Trump administration has signaled that its gold card program could replace another existing path for foreign investors to get residency in the U.S.: the EB-5 program. Created by Congress in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy, it offers visas in exchange for an investment of at least $800,000. It has a cap of about 10,000 participants each fiscal year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScrapping or significantly changing the EB-5 program could lead to more expensive borrowing costs for real-estate developers \u2014 and in turn, higher rents and home prices, said Ishaan Khanna, president of the American Immigrant Investor Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group that represents EB-5 investors.\n\nEB-5 visa holders are required to create jobs with their investments, which is why they often pour money into real-estate projects instead of stocks and bonds, Khanna explained.\n\nIn the real-estate world, EB-5 investors have established themselves as a source of \u201csignificantly cheaper rates of financing\u201d for builders when compared to banks and other real-estate investors, he said. And it\u2019s typically for developments that wouldn\u2019t secure any sort of funding otherwise, he added.\n\nFor these visa holders, \u201cthe real [return on investment] for them is a green card,\u201d said Khanna, an EB-5 visa holder himself, who has been involved in residential real-estate investment and seen many other visa holders do the same. A lot of the EB-5 investor capital that Khanna has helped raise in recent years has gone toward multifamily developments across the country, he noted.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKhanna is waiting to hear more about what the Trump administration has to say about its proposed gold card program and the future of the EB-5 program. His concern is that immigrant investors stay protected: \u201cThere is some room for all of us to work together on this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has signaled an interest in changing the EB-5 program. Some EB-5 investments have been made in projects that were \u201coften suspect, they didn\u2019t really work out, there wasn\u2019t any oversight of it,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this week.\n\nLutnick said he was working with other Trump administration officials to modify the EB-5 program. \u201cIt was poorly overseen, poorly executed,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you had our border open, where millions of people came through.\u201d\n\nAndrew Keshner contributed.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch",

She added, \u201cIt also strengthens the UAE\u2019s position as a global hub for sustainability and spotlights its role in creating climate-smart and environmentally friendly solutions.\u201d\n\n20 leading individuals from the field will be granted permits under the first phase of the program, including an architect raising awareness about sustainable living, a veterinarian dedicating his life to wildlife conservation, and a sustainability expert who spent two decades in international development.\n\nMoving forward, individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the fields of environmental protection and sustainability, both within the UAE and abroad, will be able to apply for the Blue visa. WAM, the state-owned news agency, counts members of international organisations and international companies, members of associations and non-governmental organisations, global award winners, distinguished activists, researchers, sustainability advocates and other experts in the field amongst those who will be considered. Individuals can also be nominated for the visa by relevant government authorities.\n\nAt a time when global leaders such as the United States are turning their back on climate action and the rise of right wing sentiments across the West is leading to a surge in climate denialism, policies such as the Blue visa offer a glimmer of hope. While the UAE still has a long way to go when it comes to issues such as reducing fossil fuel emissions and curtailing rampant energy consumption, the move is nevertheless a step in the right direction.",

            "content": "Live Events\n\nNew Delhi: Study abroad consultants across India are facing a surge in frantic calls. Students braving the end of the student direct stream programme in Canada and caps on the permits to international students - or already studying there - are desperate for clarity as the country's latest immigration regulations take effect. These students and their parents are also seeking help from the consultants to chart their way forward.Sudden permit cancellations, heightened scrutiny of visa applications and stricter enforcement of departure rules have already thrown thousands of the estimated 423,000 Indians in Canada into a tizzy.\"We've had multiple clients lose their permits despite perfect academic records. The IRCC (the government department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) projects 7,000 more revocations this year - I think that's conservative,\" said Nikhil Jain, founder of ForeignAdmits.Fall 2025 applicants face the new C$20,635 GIC (guaranteed investment certificate) requirement - a massive financial hurdle for middle-class Indian families - and lending institutions have also become hesitant in funding students going to Canada, he said.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)The new regulations, which came into effect on January 31, give border officers greater discretion to cancel visas or refuse entry if they believe a student might overstay the authorised period.This has led to increased rejections and processing delays raising concerns about Canada\u2019s long-term appeal as a study destination. \u201cThe new measures could lead to increased scrutiny of study permit applications, longer processing times, and higher rejection rates,\u201d said Waseem Javed, founder of EduVib.Canada has been a preferred destination for Indian students, but according to Aarushi Jain, partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, \u201cChange in regulations and visa issues will likely result in a dip in students applying to Canada; although students with proper paperwork may not have much to worry about.\u201dOthers believe the effect to be widespread. Subsuming those enrolling in private colleges \u2014 often a more affordable route \u2014 face a higher chance of rejection, and even students in public universities must now meet stricter compliance standards to retain their study permits. For those already in Canada, the situation is equally precarious. Many students are seeing their study permits revoked mid-programme over minor documentation issues. Consultants warn that retroactive scrutiny is creating widespread panic.If a student\u2019s permit is revoked, the student may be required to leave unless he or she successfully appeal, Javed explains.Experts said legal costs for appeals start at C$1,500, with no guarantee of success. Some students may qualify for alternative visa pathways, but the options are shrinking fast. \u201cWe\u2019re telling our Canadian clients to document everything \u2014 every hour worked and every address change should be reported within seven days. Canada has shifted from welcoming to suspicious, and students must adapt fast,\u201d said Jain.Siddharth Iyer, chief operating officer of OneStep Global, highlighted how Canada\u2019s tightening stance is already affecting numbers. \u201cThere\u2019s a 40% drop in study permits issued to Indian students since Q4 2023,\u201d he said.He added that with Indian students making up 35-40% of Canada\u2019s international student population, a sustained decline could impact university finances and the broader economy.With federal elections slated for later this year, the recent spate of moves to effectively put the brakes on the intake of international students may be driven by electoral compulsions.\u201cThe government is under pressure to appease a frustrated electorate. This isn\u2019t just about immigration \u2014 it\u2019s about politics, economics, and public sentiment. Rising housing costs, healthcare strain, and growing anti-immigration rhetoric have pushed the Canadian government to act, and international students are now caught in the crossfire,\u201d said Adarsh Khandelwal, cofounder of Collegify.Beyond domestic concerns, geopolitical factors may also be at play. Canada\u2019s stricter immigration stance follows Donald Trump\u2019s recent threat to impose tariffs if Ottawa does not curb illegal immigration into the US.",

(NYSE:V) stands against the other stocks to buy before spring.\n\nSeasonality in the Stock Market\n\nSeasonality is simply a historical average of how the stock market performs over the course of the year. March has traditionally been a good month for equities, with prices rising more frequently than not and yielding a positive return on average. Furthermore, the first three months of spring often result in robust advances across all indexes. On the other side, because September is often a weak month for equities, a trader who generally takes long positions may choose to take the month off or sell their holdings earlier than normal if they begin to decrease during September.\n\nNaturally, there are a number of investing strategies based on seasonal trends. \"Sell in May and Go Away\" is one such well-known financial aphorism that refers to a stock investment strategy based on the notion that the stock market underperforms during the six months of May to October. Historical facts have usually confirmed this adage throughout the years, particularly after 1945. Furthermore, the S&P 500 generates positive returns around two-thirds of the time from May to October, increasing to 77% from November to April.\n\nSome possibilities surrounding this phenomenon include increased Christmas purchasing, holiday-fueled optimism, and investors settling their accounts before leaving for vacation. While growth is somewhat slow in February and March, the stock market often rises in April owing to the expected publication of first-quarter reports. In contrast, the period from May to October is often less positive, with first-quarter earnings having already been released and many investors spending less time paying attention to equities while on vacation.\n\nSectors Outperforming in Spring\n\nJPMorgan's Ilan Benhamou expects that, given the backdrop of worsening economic indicators, the US stock market would plateau in early March before recovering later in the Spring. He stated:\n\n\"In the short term, the situation is too chaotic, and the stock market will struggle to break through. I believe the market is stagnating. With liquidity improving, macro uncertainties easing, profits continuing to show resilience in USA businesses, losses stopping, and retail investors buying in again, I believe that in the medium term, the S&P 500 Index will rise and yields will decline.\"\n\nKnowing this, more than just select companies, investors would probably be more interested in knowing what sectors of the market outperform the others during the Spring season. Thankfully, CNBC already did the heavy lifting a while back. CNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.",

Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nHow no-fee credit cards work in Canada\n\nWhat is a no-fee credit card?\n\nA no-fee credit card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee: the lump sum amount charged by card issuers to help cover the cost of card rewards and programs. Most of the best Canadian credit cards carry annual fees over $100.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t to say you won\u2019t ever pay any fees while holding a no-free credit card \u2014 you\u2019ll likely still need to deal with interest charges, inactivity fees and the like. But annual fees? No-fee cards don\u2019t have any, which could help you trim down on unnecessary costs.\n\nThe only downside? No-fee cards may not offer the same premium perks that often accompany cards with steep annual fees. That said, no-fee cards still have some perks, including cash-back reward programs, travel points and more.\n\nCommon features of a no-fee credit card\n\nEvery no-fee credit card is unique, so the included features will differ. That said, here are some of the common features you may get:\n\nInterest-free grace period.\n\nFraud protection.\n\nIncreased earn rate on some merchant categories.\n\nRewards (cash back, travel, store, etc).\n\nPurchase protection.\n\nExtended warranty.\n\nAdmittedly, no-fee credit cards often have fewer benefits than credit cards with an annual fee. But some no-fee credit cards may still include helpful perks, such as mobile device protection or travel insurance.\n\nIs a no-fee credit card a free credit card?\n\nA no-fee card isn\u2019t exactly the same as a free credit card. While no-fee credit cards don\u2019t charge you an annual fee, there will likely be other costs associated with using a no-fee card, including:\n\nAll of these additional fees should be clearly outlined in the terms and conditions that come with your card. As long as you use your no-fee credit card responsibly, it may be possible to avoid fees completely.\n\nDo no-fee credit cards still earn rewards?\n\nYes, there are many no-fee credit cards that earn rewards. The type of rewards you\u2019ll receive depends on what card you choose. The typical rewards categories are as follows:\n\nNo-fee cash back cards earn a percentage back in cash on purchases.\n\nNo-fee travel cards earn airline, hotel or even general travel rewards points.\n\nCo-branded no-fee store and retail cards earn store or retail rewards that can be redeemed at participating stores for groceries, merchandise and more.\n\nTypes of no-fee credit cards in Canada\n\nMany types of no-fee credit cards are available, with the best offering the ability to earn valuable rewards, cash back and more, all without having to pay an annual fee.\n\nNo-fee cash back credit cards\n\nCash-back credit cards are fairly simple as far as perks are concerned: spend money; get a percentage of what you\u2019ve spent back in cash. Now, as for the type of purchases that earn rewards and how much cash back you get for them, that\u2019s what separates different types of cash-back cards.\n\nTake the Simplii Financial\u2122 Cash Back Visa Card: it\u2019s a no-fee cash back card that offers 4% cash back each time you swipe your card at a restaurant, bar or coffee shop, up to $5,000 per year.\n\nIn comparison, the Tangerine Money-Back Credit Card offers unlimited cash back at a 2% rate in up to three money-back categories of your choice.\n\nNo-fee travel credit cards\n\nTravel cards offer travel-related rewards when you use your card. Some travel cards charge large annual fees in exchange for premium perks, like comprehensive travel insurance packages.\n\nBut the rewards offered by no-fee travel credit cards are nothing to sneeze at. The CIBC Aeroplan\u00ae Visa Card doesn\u2019t carry an annual fee and earns Aeroplan points every time you spend on gas, groceries and Air Canada travel purchases, for example.\n\nAnd the BMO AIR MILES\u00ae\u2020 Mastercard\u00ae*, another no-fee card, earns Air Miles rewards and comes with car rental discounts.\n\nNo-fee rewards cards\n\nRewards cards allow you to earn points for making eligible purchases. And these points can be redeemed for all types of perks, from travel vouchers to electronic gift cards.\n\nFor example, the American Express\u00ae Green Card lets you earn rewards points across a variety of spending categories and points can be put towards purchases, travel spending, gift cards; you name it. Plus, you can transfer points to other loyalty programs, like Aeroplan and Marriott Bonvoy.\n\nNo-fee Mastercards\n\nCredit cards branded with the Mastercard name or logo belong to the Mastercard network. Mastercard is not a card issuer, it simply processes credit card payments. And because Mastercard is one of the most popular card processors in the world, there are plenty of cards to pick from \u2014 including cards without annual fees.\n\nOne example of a no-fee Mastercard with generous perks is the Brim Mastercard. It earns rewards points on everyday purchases, offers free global WiFi access and comes with travel, event ticket and mobile device insurance coverage.\n\nWho should get a no-fee credit card?\n\nA no-fee card may not be suitable for everyone, depending on their spending habits and financial goals, but there are some circumstances in which this type of card is a practical fit:\n\nYou\u2019re building your credit history. When you begin building your credit history, a card with a high annual fee may not be helpful. No-fee cards are free to carry, so they can help you focus on building your credit without having to worry about whether you\u2019re using your card often enough to justify the annual cost.\n\nYou don\u2019t use your card that often. Getting a card with an annual fee makes sense if you\u2019re able to earn more than you pay \u2014 but this tends to require more frequent use and thousands of dollars in spending. If you only anticipate using your credit card for the odd infrequent purchase, a no-fee card may be more practical.\n\nYou\u2019re seeking a secondary card. Maybe you\u2019ve already got a credit card, but you want a secondary card to double down on the points-earning process. A no-fee card might be the way to go. Or, maybe you\u2019d like a Visa to compliment your Mastercard \u2014 or vice versa. Not all merchants accept both.\n\nAdvantages of no-fee credit cards\n\nNo annual fee. As long as you\u2019re paying your balance in full and on time each month, it doesn\u2019t cost you anything to have the card.\n\nYou can keep your account open for a long time. Since it doesn\u2019t cost anything to keep the card active, your total available credit will grow, which has a positive effect on your credit utilization \u2014 one of the biggest factors in your credit score.\n\nGood for emergencies. No-fee credit cards are low-cost and low-maintenance, so they make for an excellent backup credit card.\n\nHelps you build credit. Using your credit card responsibly will build your credit history and credit score.\n\nEarn rewards. You can earn points or miles that can later be redeemed for travel or merchandise.\n\nDisadvantages of no-fee credit cards\n\nLimited benefits. Credit cards that charge an annual fee often have better benefits and higher reward earn rates.\n\nSmaller welcome bonus. No-fee cards usually have a less generous sign-up offer compared to cards with a fee.\n\nCan create high-interest debt. As with all credit cards, you could go into debt if you don\u2019t manage your spending.\n\nWhen is an annual fee worth paying?\n\nAnnual fees for Canadian credit cards can range from $6.95 to $699, and the cost may be worthwhile \u2014 it really all depends on your financial situation, lifestyle and spending habits.\n\nFor example: a travel credit card with an annual fee may be a practical fit if you\u2019re often on the road and frequently purchase travel insurance \u2014 a perk offered by numerous travel rewards cards.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s a cash-back credit card with an annual fee that offers bonus rewards for something you spend a lot of money on, like gas or groceries.\n\nEssentially, a credit card\u2019s annual fee is worth it if the amount of value (savings or rewards) you can squeeze from the card each year is higher than the amount of the fee.\n\nHow to choose a no-fee credit card\n\nWhen comparing credit cards, assessing the annual fee they charge is typically important. Of course, with no-fee cards, this isn\u2019t a concern. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re all the same. Here are some other things to consider when deciding between no-fee credit cards in Canada.\n\nInterest rate\n\nAll credit cards \u2014 even no-fee cards \u2014 charge interest and those interest rates should factor into the card you choose. The no-fee cards on our list carry an average purchase interest rate of 20.2%, which is pretty standard. The average interest rate for a Canadian credit card in any category is 19.4%, but cards with lower rates exist, some under 10%. They\u2019re rare, but they\u2019re out there.\n\nIf you tend to carry a balance on your card, keep your eyes peeled for no-fee cards with lower interest rates \u2014 anything under 20% is a competitive rate in this category.\n\nWelcome bonus or intro offer\n\nIntroductory offers often come in the form of special cash-back offers or extra rewards points. They\u2019re designed to help incentivize new card applications and could be a factor worth considering as you narrow down your no-fee credit card options.\n\nThe caveat to welcome bonuses? You don\u2019t always get the points or cash just for signing up. To nab the intro offer, you may have to spend a minimum amount within a certain time frame after opening the card, for example. The thing to note about welcome bonuses or intro offers is that they\u2019re typically temporary, often ending after a few months.\n\nOngoing rewards rate\n\nWhen comparing no-fee card options, take a look at what type of rewards the card will earn even after the intro offer expires \u2014 more specifically, how they\u2019re earned and ways they can be redeemed.\n\nWhether you earn points from affiliated travel programs or cold hard cash back on eligible purchases, you\u2019ll want a rewards program that will encourage you to make the most of your spending.\n\nPerhaps even more important, however, is how points are earned. One card may offer triple the points on your weekly grocery bill, while another may let you double down on your travel miles each time you book a flight with a qualifying carrier.\n\nCredit card insurance\n\nSome no-fee credit cards come with insurance coverage, but not all. Insurance coverage offerings may include travel insurance, event ticket protection, extended warranty and purchase security protection and more.\n\nInsurance coverage through your no-fee credit card may not be a strict necessity if you have coverage through an independent insurer or through your employer. But it can offer added protection and peace of mind, depending on the coverage available.\n\nHow to apply for a no-fee credit card\n\nTo apply for a no-fee credit card in Canada, you\u2019ll first need to ensure that you meet the issuer\u2019s eligibility requirements, and then follow the typical steps to submit an application.\n\nEligibility requirements for a no-fee credit card\n\nEligibility criteria may vary, but the baseline requirements for a no-fee credit card tend to be fairly standard.\n\nAge and residency status\n\nYou must be a Canadian resident, and you must be the age of majority in the province or territory you live in.\n\nCredit score\n\nAll of the no-fee cards on our list require applicants to have a Canadian credit file, so if this is your first credit card, you may need to explore other options, like getting a secured credit card, instead.\n\nMinimum credit score thresholds may also come into play, depending on the card you choose.\n\nPersonal or household income requirements\n\nIncome requirements tend to be more common among high-tier credit cards, while no-fee credit card income requirements tend to be much lower, if they\u2019re required at all.\n\nSteps to apply for a no-fee credit card\n\nWhen you apply for a no-fee credit card, there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be approved. The credit card provider needs to assess your financial profile to determine if you\u2019re creditworthy. The application process will typically look something like this:\n\nFill out an application. This can be done online or at your financial institution. The application will ask for some basic information, such as your name, date of birth, address, social insurance number, employer and income. Your information is checked. The credit card issuer will make an inquiry on your credit report and verify the information that you provided. A decision is made. If you apply online, instant approval (or disapproval) is possible, but there\u2019s also a chance the credit card issuer will ask you to contact them to provide additional information. Your card is mailed out. Your credit card will immediately be mailed out and will typically arrive within 14 business days. Activate your card. Once your card arrives, you\u2019ll need to activate it by logging into your account or calling the number on your card. Once activated, you can use your card to make purchases.\n\nCan you get a no annual fee credit card with bad credit?\n\nIt depends on your situation.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a student, some financial institutions will approve you for a no-fee student credit card even if you don\u2019t have much credit history.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have a bad credit score due to previous financial difficulties, you may not be approved for a traditional no-fee credit card. However, you may still get another type of credit card.\n\nYou would likely still qualify for a no-fee secured credit card. These types of credit cards are similar to regular credit cards, but you need to deposit security funds. These funds act as your credit limit, but you can\u2019t use them to pay your card balance.",

            "content": "In Case You Missed It\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s meeting with President Zelensky of Ukraine turned into an explosive shouting match on live television, a moment unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen at the White House. At an Oval Office appearance Friday the Ukrainian president met with Trump to sign a mineral rights deal, when Trump accused Zelensky of being ungrateful and \u201cgambling with World War III.\u201d Zelensky had questioned whether Trump would be able to get President Putin of Russia to honor a peace agreement without security guarantees, saying the Russian leader had broken cease-fire accords in the past. Vice President Vance, sitting on a nearby couch, chastised Zelensky for not showing more appreciation for Trump\u2019s efforts. The U.S. president then issued an ultimatum: \u201cYou\u2019re either going to make a deal or we\u2019re out.\u201d The fiery exchange (here\u2019s the video) revealed Trump\u2019s nakedly combative approach to dealmaking. Zelensky left without signing the mineral agreement. Elon Musk, whose Starlink satellite internet service has been vital to Ukraine\u2019s military defenses, seemed to praise Trump on X after the exchange.\n\nShari Redstone urged her board to find a resolution with President Trump. Redstone, who is trying to sell Paramount, her family business, to David Ellison\u2019s Skydance, directed her board to find a way to resolve Trump\u2019s lawsuit against the company\u2019s CBS News division, DealBook was first to report. The president sued the company last year for $20 billion, accusing the network of deceptively editing an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris to cast her in a more favorable light. Even though legal experts say Trump has a weak case, some Paramount executives feel a settlement would smooth the way with the Trump administration toward greenlighting the company\u2019s Skydance merger.\n\nApple\u2019s Tim Cook gave a lesson in the art of dealmaking with President Trump. The Apple leader drew praise from Trump for his commitment to invest $500 billion in the United States and create 20,000 more jobs over the next four years. The stakes are high for Apple because its iPhones are primarily made in China, which faces an additional 10 percent tariff on exports. But Cook appeared to take a page out of his playbook from Trump\u2019s first term, when he pledged more U.S. investment and won tariff exemptions. By the way, that $500 billion commitment was probably already earmarked. Expect similarly framed corporate announcements to follow.\n\nThe S.E.C. said memecoins aren\u2019t like stocks and bonds. That means you and I can trade them at our own risk and the novelty crypto tokens \u2014 including those tied to President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump \u2014 won\u2019t be subject to regulatory oversight. Trump, whose presidential campaign was backed by top crypto executives, has promised less regulation for the industry. Even so, the price of Bitcoin has plunged in recent days, stoking concern about crypto volatility.\n\nImage\n\nWeighing a return to Russia\n\nPresident Trump and President Putin of Russia marked the third anniversary of the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine this week with a similar message: Russia will soon be open for business. Never mind that Russia and the United States remain far apart on the fundamental terms of a peace negotiation, or that Russia is under heavy sanctions by Western countries, or that uncertainty over the region\u2019s future has only grown after yesterday\u2019s Oval Office blow-up.",

The names of several others indulging in similar crimes are likely to surface during the course of investigations.\n\nAccording to the ED findings, these three entities were operating independently and purportedly dealt with clients looking for work/study visas for mostly the U.S., apart from the United Kingdom and Canada. It alleges that Red Leaf Immigration coordinated among various conduits to facilitate visas for its clients. \u201cWe have found that Infowiz Software Solution was arranging forged documents, primarily birth certificates,\u201d said an official.\n\nThe agency suspects that those running Overseas Partner Education Consultants also played a role in extending short-term loans to the interested visa applicants, against a small percentage of the amounts as commission, for them to show a minimum required bank balance for convincing the authorities that they had enough money to meet their expenses in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIn such cases, educational/professional work experience certificates are also provided to the otherwise ineligible visa applicants, at commission rates that are fixed as per the level or type of educational qualification, percentage of marks, and duration of work experience required,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe ED probe is based on the First Information Reports (FIRs) registered by the police in Delhi and Punjab on the complaints lodged by the U.S. Embassy. In September last year, the Punjab Police booked seven persons/entities, including Red Leaf Immigration and Overseas Partner Education Consultants, operating from Ludhiana and Chandigarh.\n\nDuring the recent searches on the premises of suspects, the Directorate has seized digital devices and documents, besides \u20b919 lakh in cash.

And it echoes similar \u201cgolden visa \u201d programs in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, Malta and others that have allowed participants to pay a fee or make an investment in order to secure a pathway to residency in desirable places.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is planning a \u201cgold card\u201d visa with a potential pathway to U.S. citizenship for $5 million.\n\nWhat does the U.S. already offer?\n\nCongress created a program called EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program in 1990 to create jobs and encourage foreign investment. Under that program, investors who spent about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people can qualify for a visa and a pathway to permanent residency.\n\nAbout 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department\u2019s most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.\n\nWhat do other countries offer?\n\nHenley & Partners, which advises both governments and people on residence or citizenship by investment programs, says more than 100 countries around the world offer or have offered \u201cgolden visas\u201d to wealthy individuals and investors. That list includes the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, although some countries have tightened their restrictions or ended programs.\n\nUnder different programs in different countries, requirements include buying a house, making a financial investment or creating a certain number of jobs.\n\n\n\nPBS News\u2019 Tim McPhillips spoke with White House Correspondent Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez about what U.S. troops are doing along the southern border and how their roles could change.\n\nBasil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner Henley & Partners North America, said the programs often help countries meet investment goals. But they don\u2019t always last.\n\nSpain\u2019s government scrapped its program to allow people from outside the European Union to obtain residency permits if they invested more than half a million euros ($520,000) in real estate. The program was criticized for causing soaring housing prices. The U.K. ended its program in 2022 over security concerns.\n\nWill Trump\u2019s \u2018gold visa\u2019 program be effective in spurring U.S. investment?\n\nMohr-Elzeki of Henley & Partners said despite the high price tag, there may be an appetite for the program, but it remains to be seen what the parameters are.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that much information aside from the investment threshold and the intention,\u201d he said. But generally these kind of programs can help countries meet investment goals, depending on the goal, he said.\n\n\u201cWe do think that there will be significant demand in this program,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just waiting on on the details of what frameworks that they\u2019re going to be outlining.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Fact-checking the Trump White House\u2019s claims about illegal immigration dropping sharply\n\nThe key to whether it will be a success or not will less likely be the $5 million investment threshold and more to do with the process.\n\n\u201cTypically speaking, the lower the residency requirements, the more popular the program as those wealthy individuals globally, they like options,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they may be investing in the United States, but they may invest elsewhere as well \u2014 to have access to live in the States, access to live in Europe, access to live in the UAE. So all of these come into play. \u201d\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIf the new program replaces the existing EB-5 program in two weeks, there are questions over what will happen to people in the existing program. Typically those people get grandfathered in to the new program but there\u2019s a possibility they might not be, said Mohr-Elzeki.\n\nIn 2022, Congress extended the EB-5 program until 2027, so Congressional action would be needed to change it. But Trump has said gold cards won\u2019t require Congressional approval.",

Sometimes that investment comes in the form of buying property, but it can also be through venture capital funds or made as a donation to a government-approved philanthropic project or charity.\n\nAs global uncertainty has risen, golden visas \u201chave become a hedging tool against who knows what tomorrow brings,\u201d Mr. Volek said.\n\nOne added advantage is that if you become a resident of some European Union countries, you can travel freely in a number of other countries in the bloc. Many golden visa programs in Europe, including in Portugal, Greece and Italy, also allow individuals to apply for citizenship after a certain number of years of residency.\n\nWhy did some countries start offering golden visas?\n\nDuring Europe\u2019s debt crisis in 2012, many governments were looking for ways to make up for budget shortfalls.

From noon EST on March 7 to noon EST on March 24, employers can submit registrations on behalf of beneficiaries for whom they wish to file H-1B petitions. Beneficiaries selected in this year\u2019s lottery with an approved petition can begin working as early as October 1, 2025. However, significant shifts in the immigration landscape are reshaping every step employers take to secure these coveted visas while bracing for the compliance challenges that lie ahead.\n\nEvery chance you take\n\nThe demand for H-1B visas remains exceptionally high, underscoring the crucial role foreign professionals play in driving U.S. innovation and growth. With an annual cap of 85,000 visas\u201465,000 for bachelor\u2019s degree holders and 20,000 for those with a master\u2019s from U.S. institutions\u2014the competition is intense. Last year saw 479,953 registrations, far exceeding the cap. Despite this, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) selected significantly more registrations than available visas, emphasizing the element of chance in the selection and approval processes.\n\nEvery claim you make\n\nDuring its second term, the Trump administration has prioritized enforcement and compliance more than ever before. Employers must prepare for increased scrutiny from registration through petition adjudication and beyond. For instance, they must:\n\nPay the increased registration fee of $215 per beneficiary.\n\nProve the employer has a \u201cbona fide position in a specialty occupation\u201d for the beneficiary as of the requested start date. This change is aimed at preventing an employer from submitting petitions based on a claim of an available job when, in fact, the job is unavailable at the time the petition is filed.\n\nProve the \u201cbona fide position\u201d meets the new regulatory criteria of \u201cspecialty occupation.\u201d\n\nBe legally present in the United States, accept service of process, and otherwise be amenable to suit.\n\nParticipate and cooperate in USCIS site visits or risk USCIS revoking a previously approved petition or denying a pending petition for an employer\u2019s noncompliance.\n\nThese changes require strategic business planning.\n\nEvery step you take, every claim you make \u2026 it\u2019s ALL under review\n\nRegardless of whether an employer sponsors employees, businesses across all industries must brace for increased worksite enforcement, including audits and potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Industries heavily reliant on foreign workers, such as technology, engineering, hospitality, and healthcare, must navigate this climate with foresight. Key actions include:\n\nReviewing Form I-9s and related documentation to catch and correct errors.\n\nUpdating internal policies to ensure continuity in the employment verification process.\n\nTraining staff responsible for employment verification.\n\nEnsuring public access files for sponsored employees are complete.\n\nTraining staff on what to do during ICE raids and site visits and responding to administrative warrants, subpoenas, and judicial warrants from government officials.\n\nFurthermore, Oklahoma\u2019s recent implementation of Operation Guardian, a joint initiative with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, adds another layer of enforcement at the local level. This program empowers state law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws, significantly impacting compliance for businesses in Oklahoma. Employers are advised to adjust their strategies to prepare for this increased scrutiny at the state and federal levels.\n\nBottom line\n\nIn this complex environment, every step an employer takes is key. With federal and state law enforcement closely monitoring compliance, preparation and a robust compliance framework are essential. Employers should actively engage with legal counsel to ensure adherence to immigration regulations and mitigate risks. By staying informed and prepared, businesses can navigate increased enforcement measures effectively, mitigate risks, and continue benefiting from a diverse workforce.\n\nFor assistance with the H-1B, other visa petitions, or questions about preparing for increased worksite enforcement, please contact the author, Kate N. Dodoo, or your McAfee & Taft labor and employment attorney.

            "content": "When the Rev. Ryan Cook addressed his congregation after the Holy Eucharist on January 5, he had just three more weeks to serve as rector of Church of the Ascension in Orlando, Florida, before he and his family would be forced to return to their home country of Canada.\n\nCook\u2019s abrupt departure from the parish was prompted by a federal backlog in permanent residency applications that has left foreign-born priests serving within U.S. churches in a precarious position.\n\n\u201cSome of you have asked, \u2018How are you doing?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s terrible, you know. It\u2019s terrible for myself and my family, and our hopes, and our enjoyment with what we\u2019re doing at Church of the Ascension. \u2026 It feels like getting hit by a truck,\u201d Cook told parishioners. \u201cAnd at the same time, I\u2019ve just been so incredibly blessed in the last few weeks with the incredible care [that] has come through.\u201d\n\nSeveral priests throughout the Episcopal Church face a similar future: when their R-1 visa (which is granted temporarily to religious workers in the U.S.) expires, they may be forced to return to their home countries, leaving their parishes upended without a pastor.\n\nIn the case of Ascension, the church will soon begin the search for its next rector after two years of growth under Cook\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cThe church is going to go through a search process that neither [Cook] nor the church wants, nor do I or Bishop [Justin] Holcomb want,\u201d said the Rev. Canon Dan Smith, canon to the ordinary in the Diocese of Central Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re losing a priest who is doing just outstanding work in that congregation. By any measurable you want to measure, he\u2019s doing terrific work.\u201d\n\nTwo other priests in the Diocese of Central Florida in the U.S. on R-1 visas, including another Canadian and a native of Haiti, are seeking recourse before their temporary residency runs out, Smith said.\n\nThe crisis follows a procedural change implemented nearly two years ago in the government\u2019s allocation of the employment-based visa category in which religious workers fall, called EB-4.\n\nA typical pathway for foreign-born clergy is to come to the U.S. on an R-1 visa, which permits them to stay in the country 30 months and allows for an additional 30-month extension, for a total of five years in the country. During that five-year period, they may apply for an EB-4 visa, which allows them to stay in the U.S. permanently and provides a potential pathway to citizenship.\n\nIn March 2023, the State Department folded in another category of people (minors and refugees from Central and South American countries) to the EB-4 queue alongside religious workers, while maintaining the same 10,000 cap on EB-4 visas awarded annually. That influx of applicants into the visa pool created a severe logjam; as of the end of 2024, the state was processing applications from early 2021.\n\n\u201cIf you were here on an R-1 visa and you wanted to immigrate during that five-year period, that used to be easily attainable; it was a six- to 12-month process,\u201d said the Rev. Jonathan Turtle, a Canadian priest who serves as rector of Emmanuel Episcopal Church, also in Orlando. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a four-year backlog. So now, all of a sudden, it\u2019s harder to do that in that five-year window that you have within R-1. You don\u2019t have the wiggle room.\u201d\n\nFor clergy on an R-1 extension, time will likely run out before they are granted permanent residency. At that point, they will be required to leave the U.S. for at least a year before they can reapply for R-1 status.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re starting from scratch,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou lose your place in line, and of course, that\u2019s after you\u2019ve been gone 12 to 18 months. A church can\u2019t wait for their rector for 12 to 18 months. That\u2019s not good for the congregation; that\u2019s not good for anybody.\u201d\n\nOrdained in the Diocese of Toronto, Turtle served for several years in his home diocese until social media connections and the Diocese of Central Florida\u2019s reputation as a center of thriving, orthodox Anglicanism prompted him to consider opportunities south of the Canadian border.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. Greg Brewer, then diocesan bishop, identified Emmanuel as a good fit, and interviews confirmed that for Turtle and his family. He was offered the job in November 2021, and the church took on the role of sponsoring Turtle\u2019s R-1 visa. In October 2022, Turtle was granted his visa. Along with his wife and four children, he relocated in January 2023, starting the clock on his five-year stay.\n\nNow two years into his rectorship, Turtle is hoping there will be enough runway for him to be granted permanent residency before his R-1 visa expires in early 2028. He\u2019s now in line to petition for his EB-4.\n\n\u201cThe timeline just barely lines up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were to work out for us to be able to stay, some things in the next three years would have to change.\u201d\n\nAnother priest who relocated from Canada on a temporary visa for his position at a growing Episcopal church in early 2023 is also bracing himself for possible turbulence ahead.\n\nThe priest, who requested anonymity, said he never expected to land in Texas, but when the opportunity arose in the wake of the pandemic, he found it was the right opportunity for him and his family. Now, it\u2019s a question of how long they will be able to stay.\n\n\u201cWe came here with an initial commitment of three years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in year three, and the longer we\u2019re here, the more difficult it is to see ourselves leaving. But I never expected to be here in the first place, and I never expected anything in my life to go the way it has, and God\u2019s been kind of providentially leading our family. So, I trust that if this door closes that there\u2019ll be another door that opens.\u201d\n\nMany priests came to the U.S. in recent years with the understanding that moving from visa to permanent residency would not be an issue, and the federal backlog represents a change in the rules in the middle of the game, Smith said.\n\nHe said the Diocese of Central Florida has retained an immigration attorney to assist the diocese with these clergy cases and to teach him about immigration law.\n\n\u201cThis is not a subject that came up when I was in seminary,\u201d he said.\n\nSmith, who functions as transition minister for the Diocese of Central Florida and is assisting Ascension with its rector transition, said he is no longer considering candidates from outside the U.S. unless their immigration status is already decided.\n\nWith its prevalence of foreign-born clergy, the Roman Catholic Church faces more widespread disruption as a result of the federal backlog and has taken an active role in lobbying the Biden administration to address the issue. In August 2024, the Catholic Diocese of Paterson, New Jersey, and five of its affected priests sued the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services over the procedural change.\n\nA recent study conducted by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Department of Migration and Refugee Services found 90 percent of dioceses relied to some extent on foreign-born religious workers.\n\nEquivalent studies within the Episcopal Church are not available, but several diocesan representatives said they are aware of the issue and some reported having priests who are affected. The Episcopal Church received 22 clergy from other provinces in the Anglican Communion, with Canada and England sending the largest share (five each) in 2023, the most recent year of available data.\n\nThose advocating for change say small adjustments to federal procedures could mitigate the issue for clergy. For example, the American Immigration Lawyers Association has petitioned the government to reduce the amount of time those on expired R-1 visas must spend outside the U.S. before they may reapply for that status. Rather than a minimum of a year, the AILA said it should be three months or less.\n\n\u201cThis will allow a religious organization to retain their religious worker without experiencing a significant gap in services due to immigration reasons,\u201d the AILA wrote in a letter to the departments of State and Homeland Security.\n\nIn the meantime, priests like Turtle are holding their plans loosely.\n\n\u201cOur mindset was, \u2018OK this could be two-and-a-half years on an R-1 or it could be, you know, 30 years until I retire,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s kind of been our in our mindset coming into this, and I think that remains our mindset; whatever the Lord has in store for us, we\u2019ll run with that. So, for now, we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ministry experience in Central Florida has been super positive. It\u2019s a great diocese, and Emmanuel is a great parish,\u201d he added. \u201cAs a family, we\u2019re really happy there, and I could see myself there beyond the five years that the R-1 permits. It\u2019s just a question of will the government move fast enough?\u201d\n\nCook exhorted his congregation to press on in mission, even in his absence.\n\n\u201cI am going to do everything I possibly can to make sure that Church of the Ascension is set up for success, and there are things that we can do to keep the work that God has begun here at Church of the Ascension going,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it feels a little bit daunting to hear announcements like this, the Lord is at work, and don\u2019t you dare let the devil get a foothold because of a little bump in the road.\u201d",

The fall was greater than expected because the estimated number of people who came in the year to June 2023 was revised up sharply, to 906,000.\n\nHow many migrants come to the UK?\n\nNet migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving - was 728,000 in the year to June 2024, according to provisional figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That was a 20% drop from the number of people who came in the 12 months to June 2023. The newly revised total for that period was 906,000, far higher than the previous estimate of 740,000. The ONS estimates that 1.2 million people expecting to stay at least a year came to the UK in the year to June 2024. It estimates that 479,000 left the UK.\n\nThe ONS figures show that of the 1.2 million people who came to live in the UK in the 12 months to June 2024:\n\n5% (58,000) were British nationals\n\n10% (116,000) were EU nationals or from Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland (EU+)\n\naround 86% (1.0 million) were non-EU+ nationals\n\nOf the 1.0 million non-EU+ nationals who came:\n\n82% (845,000) were of working age (16 to 64 years)\n\n17% (179,000) were children (under 16 years)\n\n8% (84,000) claimed asylum, either after arriving via a regular route or arriving irregularly, for example, via small boats across the English Channel\n\nAmong non-EU+ migrants, the most common nationality coming to the UK for both work-related (116,000) and study-related (127,000) reasons was Indian.\n\nWhat are the rules for student and graduate visas?\n\nAccording to separate Home Office figures, 393,125 student visas were issued to foreign students in the year ending December 2024. That is 14% fewer than in the previous 12-month period, but still almost 50% higher (46%) than in 2019. In the year to December 2024, 21,978 visas were issued to student dependants, an 85% fall from the number issued in 2023. Since January 2024, international postgraduate students have not been able bring dependants unless their course is a research programme. Students who have already completed their degree can stay in the UK for two years - three years for those with a doctoral degree - to work under a graduate visa.\n\nHow have the salary rules for UK visa applicants changed?\n\nMost people wanting to work in the UK still have to apply for a visa through the points-based system (PBS). But since 11 April 2024, they have needed a job offer with a higher salary. Applicants have to earn at least \u00a338,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous \u00a326,200 minimum. The threshold does not apply to some jobs - such as in health and social care, and teachers on national pay scales. Announcing the new rules, the-then Conservative Home Secretary James Cleverly claimed that 300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK in 2022 would no longer qualify. At the time, groups including the CBI and the Royal College of Nursing criticised the changes for failing to address the UK's labour shortages.\n\nWhat are the rules about family visas?\n\nspouse or partner\n\nfianc\u00e9, fianc\u00e9e or proposed civil partner\n\nchild\n\nparent\n\nrelative who will provide long-term care for you\n\nYou have to demonstrate a good knowledge of English. The relative that you will live with in the UK has to meet the minimum income threshold. This was initially also due to rise to \u00a338,700 - a sharp increase from the previous \u00a318,600 figure. But after warnings the new rules risked separating families, the previous government dropped the new minimum to \u00a329,000. Anyone renewing an existing family visa does not have to meet the new earnings threshold.\n\nAre fewer people coming to work in health and social care?\n\nThe Home Office statistics showed that 27,000 visas were issued to people coming to the UK to work in health and social care in the 12 months to December 2024. This is a fall of 81% compared with the previous 12 months. The number coming to work in the sector had increased significantly after temporary changes to the health and care visa rules. In the year ending December 2024, there were approximately three dependants for each person coming to do a job in health and social care. However, the number of dependants fell sharply in the last 10 months of the period, after the previous Conservative government changed the rules to stop international social care workers bringing their children or partners with them.\n\nHow does the points-based system work?\n\nApplicants need 70 points to qualify for a skilled worker visa. This can last for up to five years before it needs to be extended. You get 50 points from having a job offer above a minimum skill level, and speaking English. The remaining 20 points can come from a higher salary, working in a sector with job shortages, or having a relevant PhD. The standard fee for a skilled visa is usually between \u00a3719 and \u00a31,639, depending on your circumstances. Visa applicants also have to pay a healthcare surcharge for each year of their stay. The amount can vary - but since April 2024, the standard fee has been \u00a31,035 per year, up from \u00a3624.\n\nWhat is the immigration salary list?\n\nThe immigration salary list replaced what was previously called the shortage occupation list. It helps employers fill vacancies in key sectors. These jobs have a lower salary threshold making it easier for applicants to gain enough points to get a visa. The list includes:\n\nhealth and care workers\n\npharmacists\n\ngraphic designers\n\nsome farming and fishing roles\n\nconstruction workers\n\nvets\n\nGetty Images A wide range of construction jobs are on the list\n\nEmployers used to be able to pay foreign workers 80% of the usual \"going rate\" to fill these positions. But this lower rate was abolished for people applying after 4 April 2024.\n\nWhat are the rules for seasonal workers?\n\n43,000 horticulture workers\n\n2,000 poultry workers\n\nSeasonal workers can stay in the UK for up to six months for horticultural work, and from 2 October to 31 December each year for poultry work. They cannot accept a permanent job or bring family members with them.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAn application costs \u00a3298. Workers must be paid the relevant national minimum wage.\n\nHow has Brexit changed immigration?\n\nBefore Brexit, EU and UK citizens had the freedom to live, work or study in any EU country without needing a visa. However, this freedom of movement ended on 1 January 2021 when the UK left the EU. In the 12 months to June 2024, the ONS figures showed that net migration for non-EU nationals - the difference between those arriving and those leaving - was 845,000.",

No new applications for CHNV can be filed. At present, Humanitarian Parole for these individuals has not been terminated, but we expect the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate parole status for these individuals soon, which will leave most of these individuals without lawful status and subject to removal proceedings.\n\nOtherwise, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has confirmed that individuals with valid parole documents are still admissible to the United States. This was confirmed in a CBP Carrier Liaison Program update .\n\nMultiple reports indicate that some individuals have been denied entry by CBP when presenting valid Form I-512 Advance Parole documents. Travelers can validate their entry documents with their airline prior to boarding a flight to the United States. Individuals entering the United States with a valid Form I-512 parole document, or with a Significant Public Benefit Parole approval, should also print out a copy of the CBP update.\n\nTravel Bans\n\nThe Trump administration has announced that a new travel ban would be implemented within 60 days of the president\u2019s inauguration.\n\nWe expect a new travel ban to be announced soon. In the prior Trump administration, later travel bans had a one-week notice period before taking effect. We would expect new travel bans to have a similar effective date. Foreign nationals who are abroad would be wise to remain travel-ready to return to the United States if new travel bans are enacted.\n\nPotential Delays in Visa Processing at US Consular Posts\n\nThe Department of State (DOS) could both reduce staffing at United States embassies and consulates and increase the frequency of initiating \u201cadministrative processing\u201d for visa applicants. Administrative processing delays visa issuance until the US Department of State (DOS) can conduct additional background screening. Foreign nationals who are traveling internationally and who must apply for a visa to return to the United States should plan for possible delays in visa processing.\n\nAdditional information on administrative processing for visa applicants can be found in our Mintz Resource Memo .\n\nLimited Visa Appointment Availability\n\nDOS announced on February 18, 2025 that it was restricting the categories of applicants who are eligible for a waiver of the in-person interview requirement for a nonimmigrant (temporary) visa. Previously, many nonimmigrant visa applicants were granted a waiver of the in-person interview requirement if they were applying for a visa in the same visa classification and had a prior visa that had expired less than 48 months ago.\n\nThe new policy restricts interview waiver eligibility to applicants who are applying for a visa in the same visa classification and had a prior visa that had expired less than 12 months ago; and to applicants of A, G, or NATO visas, or diplomatic visas. As was the case with the previous policy, applicants must also meet the following criteria:\n\napply in their country of nationality or residence;\n\nhave never been refused a visa (unless such refusal was overcome or waived); and\n\nhave no apparent or potential ineligibility.\n\nThis new policy will place additional demand for in-person visa appointments, and will likely result in longer delays in obtaining visa appointments at US consular posts.\n\nPotential Increases in CBP Searches of Electronic Devices\n\nCBP has the right to search an individual\u2019s mobile phone, computer, camera, or other electronic devices while he or she is being inspected for admission to the US CBP\u2019s use of these searches is based on the stated goal \u201cto identify and combat terrorist activity, child pornography, drug smuggling, human smuggling, bulk cash smuggling, human trafficking, export control violations, intellectual property rights violations and visa fraud.\u201d Travelers should be aware of this possibility and should restrict access to any sensitive company data if it is accessible on their phone or computer.\n\nFor further questions about travel risks and restrictions, please contact your Mintz Immigration attorney .\n\nSubscribe To Viewpoints",

But Visa wants to change that with its new global campaign debuting during the Academy Awards.\n\nThis is the first work from Visa\u2019s new agency partner Anomaly after the financial brand parted ways with Wieden+Kennedy earlier this year.\n\nThe cinematic spot, \u201cTypewriter,\u201d follows a woman who impulsively pops into a small business to buy a vintage typewriter. As she waits to be rung up at the register, her imagination takes off on a fantasy tour of potential careers that her new purchase might enable: writer of books turned into movies; chef who develops famous recipes; travel zine creator who\u2019s so successful she needs an exotic vacation.\n\nThough \u201cTypewriter\u201d has a travel theme echoing Visa\u2019s U.S. tagline, \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere you want to be,\u201d the exploration Visa is concerned with here is of a more existential nature.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the idea that embedded in every transaction is the potential of who you want to become,\u201d Jeff Cha, global head of brand at Visa, told ADWEEK. \u201cIt\u2019s not everywhere you want to be, but it\u2019s the who you want to be.\u201d\n\nThe new spot builds on \u201cProdigies,\u201d Visa\u2019s ad during the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games that spoke to the necessity of the behind-the-scenes grind involved in achieving virtuoso status. \u201cTypewriter\u201d has a more lighthearted tone, but it shares a theme of homing in on human potential.\n\nVisa\u2019s subtle shift in gear points to both the brand\u2019s evolution and its biggest challenge. Visa may be nearly everywhere, but it\u2019s also gotten a bit lost in the digital noise, according to Cha.\n\nOlder consumers who remember Visa before it was branded \u201ca world leader in digital payments\u201d may already have a sense of trust in and allegiance to the brand. But next-gen consumers\u2014people in the age range of 18 to 34\u2014generally aren\u2019t as familiar with the company\u2019s purpose, he explained.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people,\u201d Cha said. \u201cVisa does so many things\u2026 but for a consumer, at the end of the day, it\u2019s the thing that helps the credit cards be a credit card or a debit card be a debit card.

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox. President Donald Trump's proposed $5 million \"gold card\" for U.S. residency would be one the most expensive in the world, according to experts. Yet it also includes a tax loophole that would give the new-card holders a lucrative benefit not available to American citizens, experts say. Trump this week announced the creation of a new investment visa that gives the overseas wealthy permanent residency and a path to citizenship in return for $5 million. Attorneys who advise the wealthy on migration and investment visas say demand is already strong. \"The introduction of the gold card visa program represents a unique opportunity for high-net-worth individuals looking to secure U.S. residence with a pathway to citizenship,\" said Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners. \"The U.S. remains the undisputed leader in private wealth creation and accumulation.\" Volek and others who cater to the global rich say they've already fielded calls from clients wanting to purchase a Trump gold card. Approximately 135,000 of the world's millionaires are projected to migrate to a new country in 2025, according to Henley. The United Arab Emirates and the U.S. typically top the list of destinations. \"I think it's going to sell like crazy,\" Trump said at his first Cabinet news conference Wednesday. \"It's a bargain.\"\n\nWhile the details remain unclear, the proposal would radically change the U.S. residency path for the global rich, who currently have to navigate a patchwork of programs with tight restrictions to stay in the country. It would also mark a major potential tax change for the global rich living in the U.S., carving out a new loophole for gold-card holders. Currently, U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and green-card holders are required to pay income tax on their U.S. earnings as well as any income they earn overseas, including in their home country. The U.S. tax on worldwide income has traditionally made U.S. residency or citizenship far less attractive for the global rich, who have businesses spread across the world and often sheltered in tax havens. Trump said gold-card holders would not be subject to taxes on their overseas income. The provision means that gold-card residents will be able to purchase a tax benefit not available to U.S. citizens. Advisors say they're waiting on clearer directives, since the program could create dual classes of taxpayers among the American wealthy. Yet the international income carve-out makes it far more attractive to the world's ultra-wealthy. \"This would be a big departure\" in tax treatment, said Laura Foote Reiff, an attorney at Greenberg Traurig who specializes in business immigration. \"There are many wealthy individuals who are invested in U.S. companies or have families here that do not become permanent residents because they don't want the tax consequences.\"\n\nGet Inside Wealth directly to your inbox The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.

And it echoes similar \u201cgolden visa \u201d programs in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, Malta and others that have allowed participants to pay a fee or make an investment in order to secure a pathway to residency in desirable places.\n\n\u201cGolden visa\u201d programs all have different frameworks and paths to permanent residency and have had mixed results in spurring investment in a country\u2019s economy.\n\nWho will qualify for a \u2018gold card\u2019?\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said Trump\u2019s gold card would replace an existing program in two weeks, so details about who would qualify and what the application process would look like should be available before then. For now, all Trump has said is they will cost $5 million.\n\nOf recipients, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ll be wealthy and they\u2019ll be successful and they\u2019ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it\u2019s going to be extremely successful.\u201d\n\nHe added that companies, not just individuals, \u201c will be able to buy gold cards. \u201d\n\nWhat does the U.S. already offer?\n\nCongress created a program called EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program in 1990 to create jobs and encourage foreign investment. Under that program, investors who spent about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people can qualify for a visa and a pathway to permanent residency.\n\nAbout 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department\u2019s most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.\n\nWhat do other countries offer?\n\nHenley & Partners, which advises both governments and people on residence or citizenship by investment programs, says more than 100 countries around the world offer or have offered \u201cgolden visas\u201d to wealthy individuals and investors. That list includes the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, although some countries have tightened their restrictions or ended programs.\n\nUnder different programs in different countries, requirements include buying a house, making a financial investment or creating a certain number of jobs.\n\nBasil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner Henley & Partners North America, said the programs often help countries meet investment goals. But they don\u2019t always last.\n\nSpain\u2019s government scrapped its program to allow people from outside the European Union to obtain residency permits if they invested more than half a million euros ($520,000) in real estate. The program was criticized for causing soaring housing prices. The U.K. ended its program in 2022 over security concerns.\n\nWill Trump\u2019s \u2018gold visa\u2019 program be effective in spurring U.S. investment?\n\nMohr-Elzeki of Henley & Partners said despite the high price tag, there may be an appetite for the program, but it remains to be seen what the parameters are.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that much information aside from the investment threshold and the intention,\u201d he said. But generally these kind of programs can help countries meet investment goals, depending on the goal, he said.\n\n\u201cWe do think that there will be significant demand in this program,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just waiting on on the details of what frameworks that they\u2019re going to be outlining.\u201d\n\nThe key to whether it will be a success or not will less likely be the $5 million investment threshold and more to do with the process.\n\n\u201cTypically speaking, the lower the residency requirements, the more popular the program as those wealthy individuals globally, they like options,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they may be investing in the United States, but they may invest elsewhere as well \u2014 to have access to live in the States, access to live in Europe, access to live in the UAE. So all of these come into play. \u201d\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nIf the new program replaces the existing EB-5 program in two weeks, there are questions over what will happen to people in the existing program. Typically those people get grandfathered in to the new program but there\u2019s a possibility they might not be, said Mohr-Elzeki.\n\nIn 2022, Congress extended the EB-5 program until 2027, so Congressional action would be needed to change it. But Trump has said gold cards won\u2019t require Congressional approval.",

These countries include the UK, USA, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, and most European countries.\n\nOn entering Japan, all holders of foreign passports are photographed and fingerprinted. If asked, travelers arriving with a visa upon arrival should be able to provide proof of onward travel or sufficient means to purchase an air or ferry ticket out of Japan. In practice, this is rarely requested. Your passport should also be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. When returning home, if you have reported your passport as lost or stolen, you must apply for a new passport before travel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shaded interior of Hasedera Temple in Nara. freedom-man3/Shutterstock\n\nHow to apply for a visa to Japan\n\nTravelers who aren't citizens of a visa-exempt country will need to apply for one via the nearest Japanese Embassy in their home nation or organize one with an accredited travel agent approved by the Japanese Embassy.\n\nYou will need a visa to enter Japan if you\u2019re a citizen of the Philippines, Vietnam, China, Russia, CIS countries, Ukraine, Georgia, and some other countries.\n\nFor citizens of Hong Kong, visas are not required for those who hold either of these passports: the Special Administrative Region (SAR) passport issued by the Hong Kong SAR of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the British National Overseas (BNO) passport (they must have the right of residence in Hong Kong too).\n\nThe period of stay varies among the non-visa-exempt countries: 15 days for Indonesia and Thailand, 14 days for Brunei, 30 days for the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, and 90 days for other countries.\n\nTo apply for a visa, you\u2019ll need to provide a valid passport, a visa application form, a copy of your birth certificate, travel details and a clear passport-size photograph of you. Additional requirements can vary country by country \u2013 check the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan\u2019s guidelines for the most recent advice.\n\nThe general cost of visas is approximately \u00a53000 Japanese yen (US$20.11) for a single-entry visa and \u00a56000 (US$40.22) for a double- or multiple-entry visa. Fees are collected in the currency of the country in which the embassy is located. The processing period for visas is five business days from the day after the acceptance of the application.\n\nChefs working the early shift at Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. cowardlion/Shutterstock\n\nWhat if I need to extend my temporary visa?\n\nExtending a visa is possible from within Japan for citizens of Austria, Germany, Ireland, Lichtenstein, Mexico, Switzerland and the UK; these travelers may be able to extend their temporary visitor visa once, for another 90 days. Visitors wishing to do this will need to apply at a regional immigration bureau in Japan before the initial visa expires. If approved, the extension fee is \u00a54000 (US$26.82).\n\nFor other nationalities, extending a temporary visa is difficult unless you have family or business contacts in Japan who can act as a guarantor on your behalf. Options should be discussed at your nearest regional immigration bureau.\n\nTypes of visas\n\nJapan has several types of work or long-term stay visas, depending on the purpose of your travel. The main categories include general, highly skilled professional, working, specified, start-up, diplomatic, and official visas. Here are a few things to remember:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe applicant must make a visa application via the nearest Japanese Embassy/Consulate in their home nation or through an accredited travel agent that the Japanese Embassy/Consulate has approved.\n\nThe documents needed for the visa application will vary. In some cases, documents prepared by the inviting person in Japan are required in addition to the applicant\u2019s documents.\n\nApply for the visa well in advance. While the processing time is typically five days, if there is an issue, the application is sent from the Embassy/Consulate General to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo for further examination. In this instance, approval could take more than a month.\n\nYou can apply online using the eVisa system.\n\nOharai-machi is a historic shopping street in the city of Ise in Japan. iamlukyeee/Shutterstock\n\nGeneral visas\n\nGeneral visas are separated into four categories: cultural activities, student, training, and dependent (family stays).

Permanent residents who are not citizens in the US are known as \u201cgreen card\u201d holders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to give you green card privileges plus it\u2019s going to be a route to (American) citizenship,\u201d the president added.\n\nWhat is the EB-5 visa program and why is Trump ending it?\n\nLaunched in 1990, EB-5 visas are open to foreigners who invest about $1m in a company employing at least 10 people. They get immediate green cards \u2013 a pathway to eventual citizenship \u2013 in exchange. Applicants for green cards otherwise usually have to wait anywhere between several months, and often, several years to get permanent residency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EB-5 programme is capped at 10,000 visas per year, with 3,000 set aside for those investing in high-unemployment areas, according to the US State Department.\n\nThe purpose of the EB-5 visa is to \u201cstimulate the US economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors\u201d, says the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the programme is being exploited and is priced too low.\n\n\u201cThe EB-5 program \u2026 it was full of nonsense, make-believe and fraud, and it was a way to get a green card that was low-price. So the president said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we\u2019re going to end the EB-5 program,\u201d said Lutnick.\n\nIn 2021, the US Government Accountability Office found that EB-5 visas carry significant fraud risks, particularly due to challenges in tracing the origins of applicants\u2019 funds and potential perceptions of favouritism.\n\nWho could qualify for a \u2018gold visa\u2019?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be people with money,\u201d Trump said, without noting any job-creation requirements.\n\nHowever, all applicants will undergo thorough vetting to ensure they are \u201cwonderful, world-class global citizens\u201d, according to Lutnick.\n\nWhen asked if wealthy Russians could qualify, Trump replied, \u201cPossibly. I know some Russian oligarchs who are very nice people.\u201d\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear cap on the programme, with Trump suggesting the government could sell 10 million visas to help reduce the national deficit.\n\nThe programme would come as Trump\u2019s administration continues a sweeping crackdown on undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has pledged to deport en masse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow much will it cost \u2013 and what would be the benefits?\n\nAbout $5m per application.\n\nThis would make it \u201cthe most expensive golden visa option in the world,\u201d according to Kristin Surak, associate professor of political sociology at the London School of Economics.\n\n\u201cBut there will still be demand for this if the pathway is fast and smooth,\u201d Surak told Al Jazeera. \u201cStrangely, Trump is massively underselling what the US has to offer.\u201d\n\nCurrent green card holders \u2013 including those who are beneficiaries of the EB-5 initiative \u2013 typically have to live as lawful permanent residents in the US for five years before they become eligible for citizenship.\n\nIt is unclear whether gold card visa holders will have to wait less for citizenship.\n\nTrump said his administration would offer more details in two weeks, when the visas will start going on sale.\n\nDo other countries have similar initiatives?\n\nYes, so-called \u201cgolden visas\u201d are common around the world, including in European Union states like Spain and Greece. In some countries, such as Malta, Egypt and Jordan, foreign applicants can even obtain citizenship directly through investment. These \u201cgolden passport\u201d programmes are most competitive in the Caribbean, with countries like Dominica, Granada and St. Kitts and Nevis setting their fees as low as $200,000-$300,000.\n\nWhile a US gold card would likely be in high demand, it may come with the unique drawback of exposing holders to US taxes, \u201cno matter where they are in the world and no matter where their assets are\u201d, said Surak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHowever, most very wealthy people will structure their wealth so that they will not get hit by them,\u201d she added.\n\nWhy are golden visas controversial?\n\nGenerally, golden visa programmes are controversial because they can attract individuals seeking to use them for money laundering or fraud, and they can also drive up housing costs in major cities.\n\nThese concerns have led several European countries, including the UK, the Netherlands and Greece, to roll back their golden visa programmes in recent years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTrump\u2019s golden visa plan could face even more controversy if he tries to push it through without Congressional approval, which he claims is unnecessary.\n\nCongress is responsible for determining citizenship qualifications and, in the past, authorised the EB-5 programme that Trump says he intends to end.",

It\u2019s a market,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll know very soon.\u201d\n\nDuring the first meeting of his second-term Cabinet, Trump suggested that the new revenue generated from the program could be used to pay off the country\u2019s debt.\n\n\u201cIf we sell a million, that\u2019s $5 trillion dollars,\u201d he said. Of the demand from the business community to participate, he said \u201cI think we will sell a lot because I think there\u2019s really a thirst.\u201d\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters during the same meeting that Trump\u2019s initiative would replace the EB-5 program, which offers U.S. visas to investors who spent about $1 million on a company that employs at least 10 people.\n\nLutnick said that program \u201chas been around for many years for investment in projects\u201d but \u201cit was poorly overseen, poorly executed.\u201d\n\nThe new program could mark a dramatic shift in U.S. immigration policy but isn\u2019t unprecedented elsewhere. Countries in Europe and elsewhere offer what have become known as \u201cgolden visas\u201d that allow participants to pay in order to secure immigration status in desirable places.\n\nCongress, meanwhile, determines qualifications U.S. for citizenship, but the president said \u201cgold cards\u201d would not require congressional approval.\n\nTrump said of future possible recipients of the gold visa program: \u201cThey\u2019ll be wealthy and they\u2019ll be successful and they\u2019ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it\u2019s going to be extremely successful.\u201d\n\nHenley & Partners, an advisory firm, says more than 100 countries around the world offer \u201cgolden visas\u201d to wealthy individuals and investors. That list includes the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy.\n\n\u201cCompanies can buy gold cards and, in exchange, get those visas to hire new employees,\u201d Trump said. Despite similar programs already occurring outside the U.S., he insisted, \u201cNo other country can do this because people don\u2019t want to go to other countries. They want to come here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to come here, especially since Nov. 5,\u201d he said of his Election Day victory last fall.\n\nLutnick suggested that the gold card \u2014 which would actually work, at least to start, more like a green card, or permanent legal residency \u2014 would raise the price of admission for investors and do away with fraud and \u201cnonsense\u201d that he said characterize the EB-5 program.\n\nA pathway to citizenship as part of the new program also would set it apart from the EB-5 program. Trump said vetting people who might be eligible for the gold card will \u201cgo through a process\u201d that is still being worked out.\n\nPressed on if there would be restrictions on people from China or Iran not being allowed to participate, Trump suggested it will likely not \u201cbe restricted to much in terms of countries, but maybe in terms of individuals.\u201d\n\nAbout 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department\u2019s most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service reported in 2021 that EB-5 visas pose risks of fraud, including verification that funds were obtained legally. Then-President Joe Biden signed a 2022 law bringing big changes to the EB-5 program, including steps meant to investigate and sanction individuals or entities engaged in fraud as part of it \u2014 meant to curb some of those risks.\n\nTrump offered few details on how the new program might work, including making no mention of existing EB-5 requirements for job creation. While the number of EB-5 visas is capped, meanwhile, the Republican president mused that the federal government could sell 10 million \u201cgold cards\u201d to reduce the deficit. He said it \u201ccould be great, maybe it will be fantastic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s a road to citizenship for people \u2014 and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\u201d",

            "content": "President Donald Trump said he wants to replace a long-standing visa program for foreign investors with a \"gold card\" that would provide them legal permanent residency and a path to citizenship for $5 million.\n\nTrump first floated the idea during an impromptu question-and-answer session at the Oval Office on Tuesday as he signed a series of executive orders.\n\n\"Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,\" he said. \"They\u2019ll be successful, and they\u2019ll be spending a lot of money... We think it\u2019s going to be extremely successful.\u201d\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who was with Trump at the Oval Office, said the \"Trump gold card\" would replace the immigrant investor program. The EB-5 visa provides foreign nationals who invest in projects that create or sustain U.S. jobs with legal permanent residency and a path to citizenship.\n\n\"You have a green card. This is a gold card. We\u2019re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that\u2019s going to give you green card privileges,\" Trump said. Green cards, or lawful permanent resident cards, allow eligible immigrants to live and work permanently in the United States.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday, Trump presented the gold cards as a revenue opportunity for the U.S. government, saying companies could use it as a recruitment tool.\n\n\"I happen to think it\u2019s going to sell like crazy. It\u2019s a bargain,\" Trump said, adding that \"people that can pay 5 million, they\u2019re going to create jobs\" and \"they\u2019re going to have to have to pay taxes on that too.\"\n\nThe EB-5 visa program, created by Congress in 1990, is available to eligible investors who spend at least $900,000 on a company that employs at least 10 people. Participation on the program has sharply declined since 2016, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. From fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the government issued about 37,000 EB-5 visas.\n\nThe proposed gold card would essentially raise the price of admission for foreign investors, Lutnick said, and do away with \"fraud\" and \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nIn response to fraud cases related to EB-5 visas, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., successfully pushed for the program\u2019s reform in 2022.\n\nTrump said Russian oligarchs could possibly be eligible for gold cards when responding to a reporter\u2019s question on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump made no mention of the requirements for job creation, but said on Wednesday his office will be releasing more information.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to start selling, hopefully, in about two weeks,\" Trump said.\n\nA senior White House official told NBC News on Wednesday that gold card applications would be similar to applying for a green card. The official also promised a \u201cheavy\u201d vetting process, focused on national security and criminal history issues and not on \u201cnot tracking\u201d or vetting political sentiments.\n\nInvestors\u2019 visas are common around the world. Over 100 countries have some form of immigration program for foreign investors, according to Henley & Partners, an advisory firm. Popular \"golden visa\" countries include Portugal, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\nBut these programs have not been free of controversies. Critics have said \"golden visas\" create a hierarchical immigration system that gives preferential treatment to wealthy people and open the door for corruption, money laundering and other security threats.\n\nIn response, countries like Ireland and Netherlands ended their \"golden visa\" programs in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Spain recently voted to phase out theirs by April.\n\nDan Stein, president of the conservative immigration group FAIR, which supports tough immigration enforcement, told NBC News that Trump's proposal raises both national security and fraud concerns.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t recall Trump campaigning on selling citizenship to the highest bidder,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIn our view Congress would have to approve this program.\"\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hang a sign on the Statue of Liberty that says \u2018America is on sale,\u2019\u201d he added.",

Announced by President Trump, the program aims to attract high-net-worth individuals by offering a streamlined path to citizenship and contributing to economic benefits. This move is part of a global trend where countries enhance their visa offerings to draw in investment, positioning the U.S. competitively in the market for high-caliber foreign capital.\n\nTrump\u2019s Impact on Travel Read how the first 100 days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s actions and policies are shaping the future of travel, and get insights into the industry's evolving response. Read how the first 100 days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s actions and policies are shaping the future of travel, and get insights into the industry's evolving response. Read the Stories\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled plans for an immigration program \u2014 dubbed the \u201cgold card\u201d \u2014 designed to offer residency and a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d to investors willing to pay a steep price. The price tag? $5 million.\n\nSet to launch in two weeks\u2019 time, the program will be replacing the current EB-5 investor visa program, which Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called, \u201cfull of nonsense, make-believe and fraud.\u201d\n\nTrump has not yet discussed the details of the gold card program. The president said he would not be needing Congressional approval for it as it\u2019s \u201ca very strong path to citizenship, but we\u2019re not doing the citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be selling a gold card,\u201d was what Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that\u2019s going to give you green card privileges, plus it will be a route to citizenship.\u201d\n\nThe program, which aims to attract \u201cwealthy, successful people,\u201d signals a significant pivot in U.S. immigration policy \u2014 a move intended to secure economic benefits even as the administration doubles down on a strict stance against undocumented migrants.\n\nWhat This Card Entails\n\nUnder the new proposal, affluent foreign investors could secure permanent residency by making a direct payment to the U.S. government. Lutnick emphasized that the \u201cTrump Gold Card\u201d would effectively replace the \u201cridiculous\u201d EB-5 program, which currently allows investors to obtain green cards through business investments in the U.S.\n\nHe further noted that while the process would still involve careful vetting, the direct financial contribution would serve as a streamlined route to citizenship, potentially reducing bureaucratic delays and contributing to deficit reduction.\n\nTrump said he looks to sell around a million of these cards generating around $5 trillion. \"We'll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that and if you add up the numbers they're pretty good. A million cards would be worth $5 trillion and if we sell 10 million of these cards that's a total of $50 trillion, we have $35 trillion debt,\" the U.S. President said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nHe said that while people would be vetted very carefully, he didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of Russian oligarchs being eligible for the gold card. \u201cA lot of people would be able to work, provide jobs, build companies and pay taxes.\u201d\n\nWhat's the EB-5 Investor Program?\n\nThe existing EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program is a U.S. visa initiative that offers a pathway to permanent residency for eligible foreign investors.\n\nApplicants must typically invest $1.05 million in a new commercial enterprise \u2014 or $800,000 if the investment is made in a targeted employment area such as rural or high-unemployment zones.\n\nThe investment must create or preserve at least 10 full-time jobs for U.S. workers, ensuring that the program contributes directly to job growth.\n\nThe investor program aims to attract foreign capital, and support local employment.\n\nDespite its economic benefits, the EB-5 program has faced significant criticism. Critics have raised concerns over instances of fraud and inefficiencies, with some lawmakers likening it to a \u201cPonzi scheme,\u201d leading to calls for increased oversight and reform.\n\nAn AP report in 2017 had mentioned that Chinese have taken 75% of the investor visas issued by the U.S. The U.S. has taken in at least $7.7 billion and issued more than 40,000 visas to Chinese investors and their families.\n\nGlobal Trends on Golden Visa\n\nWhile the U.S. experiments with its \u201cgold card,\u201d other nations are reshaping their visa programs to attract talent and investment. The United Arab Emirates, for instance, has rolled out a suite of innovative visas \u2014 including a 10-year residency for content creators and a \u201cblue visa\u201d for environmental innovators. These initiatives are part of a broader strategy to build a dynamic, globally competitive economy by welcoming high-caliber professionals and investors.\n\nThis competitive global market for investment migration is also evident in regions such as Portugal, Canada, and Australia, all of which have refined their visa programs to lure millions in investments.\n\nGlobal wealth advisory firm Henley & Partners reported a surge in demand for residence-by-investment programs. Between 2019 and 2024, the firm observed a 1,000% surge in its American client base, while the number of British applicants rose by 57% in the past year.\n\nAccording to Henley & Partners\u2019 2025 Global Residence Program Index, Greece\u2019s increasingly popular golden visa scheme now tops the list. Switzerland claimed second place, while Portugal \u2014 long a leader \u2014 was tied for third with Italy and the UK. Australia, Canada, and Spain shared fourth place, with the UAE ranking fifth.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal, with its steeper entry price and promise of rapid processing, appears to be an attempt to capture a similar stream of high-net-worth investment into the U.S.",

Unlike regular visa denials, this section triggers lifetime exclusion from the United States with limited waiver possibilities.\n\n\u201cIn cases where applicants are suspected of misrepresenting their purpose of travel or sex, you should consider whether this misrepresentation is material such that it supports an ineligibility finding,\u201d reads the directive from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.\n\nThe instructions come after Donald Trump issued an executive order on 5 February barring trans athletes from competing in women\u2019s sports. While signing the order, the president directed the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to deny visas to \u201cmen attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes\u201d during the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles \u2013 which will take place under Trump\u2019s watch.\n\nAt the signing, Trump also directed Rubio to tell the International Olympic Committee that America \u201cwill not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes\u201d.\n\nSarah Mehta, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said the administration\u2019s use of the permanent fraud provision represents an unprecedented expansion of immigration law against a specific identity group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal to say that people accused of fraud or misrepresentation are often considered to be ineligible. It\u2019s usually a case-by-case determination,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cBut it is quite bizarre and novel in a terrible way to be saying it\u2019s based on their misrepresenting their sex or gender in order to come and participate in an event in the United States.\u201d\n\nShe added the \u201cinadmissibility\u201d provision has been used to bar groups like criminals in the past, \u201cbut to single out and label transgender individuals this way as a disfavored group is really alarming\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear how many international trans athletes will attempt to compete in the 2028 Olympics, but the New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard was the first in history at the Tokyo Games in 2020. In 2024, the American runner Nikki Hiltz competed at the Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe directive would also apply to other women\u2019s sports leagues such as the National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) and Women\u2019s National Basketball Association (WNBA), which allow trans athletes to compete, or future women\u2019s World Cup competitions hosted in the US.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

            "content": "(4 min read)\n\nAlthough the initial registration period for the fiscal year 2026 H-1B visa program is expected to open as usual for employers in March 2025, much uncertainty persists about the types of changes that may be implemented by the new Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump has warned of strict immigration enforcement measures in the works. He also has a history in this area. Near the end of his first term, he signed an executive order temporarily suspending new H-1B visas through the end of 2020. More recently, during the post-election transition period in 2024 - 2025, a feud appeared to emerge between his most vocal supporters over the future of the program.\n\n\u201cThe split over the H-1B visa program, which allows skilled workers like software engineers to work in the United States, has pitted hardline immigration opponents against some of President Trump\u2019s most prominent backers in the tech industry, who say they rely on the program because they can\u2019t find enough qualified American workers,\u201d reported The New York Times.\n\nUnderstanding the Origins and Evolution of the H-1B Visa Program\n\nThe H-1B visa program was created in 1990 in response to a looming labor shortage in the U.S., particularly with high-skilled workers. President Bush issued a statement on the day he signed The Immigration Act of 1990, declaring that it \u201crecognizes the fundamental importance and historic contributions of immigrants to our country\u201d and would \u201cencourage the immigration of exceptionally talented people, such as scientists, engineers and educators.\u201d\n\nToday employers submit a formal application to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on behalf of a foreign worker they want to hire in the U.S., describing the job and the qualifications of the worker. If approved, the H-1B visa provides temporary status in the U.S.\u2014not residency\u2014but many employers then sponsor workers with H-1B visas for a green card and help them to eventually pursue U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe program has proven to be quite popular with employers for the past 35 years, creating an important vehicle for addressing labor pool shortages in specific areas.\n\n\u201cThe H-1B non immigrant visa program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations to work temporarily in the U.S.,\u201d writes Eileen Lohmann of Berry Appleman & Leiden, in a recent Law360 Expert Analysis column. \u201cThis in-demand program is the primary pathway by which employers can recruit and hire foreign workers with expertise in specialized fields such as technology, engineering and healthcare \u2014 often filling crucial skills gaps.\u201d\n\nHowever, a vocal segment of President Trump\u2019s supporters continues to rail against the program and contend it has become abused by employers as a vehicle for hiring cheaper foreign labor, making its future uncertain in the next four years. At minimum, in-house counsel need to be vigilant about the discussions underway in Washington and prepare for possible changes to the program that make H-1Bs trickier and more expensive to navigate, according to legal observers.\n\n\u201cCompanies using the H-1B visa program to hire skilled workers from abroad should prepare for an application process that takes longer and costs more, along with site visits and heavier regulation of the program,\u201d reported LegalDive.\n\nProactive Strategies for In-House Counsel: Navigating H-1B Visa Program Changes\n\nExperts recommend that in-house legal departments conduct comprehensive risk assessments of their organization\u2019s H-1B visa dependencies. This includes identifying key positions and skill sets that rely heavily on H-1B talent, then evaluating the potential business impact of program changes.\n\nNext, map out alternative immigration categories that could serve as backup options for critical positions, such as L-1 visas for intracompany transfers, O-1 visas for individuals with extraordinary ability, or employment-based green card applications.\n\nThen create detailed contingency plans that address various scenarios. For example, immigration policy changes affecting wage requirements, qualification criteria or processing procedures will require swift adaptation of internal hiring and retention strategies. In-house counsel need to lead the way in developing standardized processes for responding to regulatory shifts while maintaining compliance.\n\nSuccess in managing any H-1B program changes will also require strong partnerships across the organization. Establish close working relationships with HR and business unit leaders to ensure alignment on workforce planning and compliance requirements. Regular cross-functional meetings can help identify potential issues early and develop coordinated responses.\n\nIn addition, robust documentation and strong internal controls become particularly crucial during periods of regulatory change. Develop and maintain detailed tracking systems for H-1B employees, including visa expiration dates, location changes and material changes in job duties. Implement comprehensive documentation protocols for all H-1B-related decisions and actions \u2014 as well as standardized templates and checklists for common H-1B processes \u2014 to ensure consistency and thoroughness across the organization.\n\nResources for In-House Counsel\n\nIn-house attorneys need access to timely legal news and insights to help them monitor changes in developments surrounding the H-1B visa program and be prepared to balance business continuity with strict compliance amid any regulatory shifts.\n\nPractical Guidance from LexisNexis\u00ae offers a number of resources to assist with this review, including:\n\nH-1B Visas: Specialty Occupation Nonimmigrant Visas , a detailed practice note developed by immigration law practitioner, Lilah Rosenblum , Rosenblum Immigration Law, PLLC;\n\n, a detailed practice note developed by immigration law practitioner, , Rosenblum Immigration Law, PLLC; H-1B Nonimmigrant (Temporary) Visa Petition Checklist , a helpful guide to ensure you are filing a complete and effective petition in support of an H-1B visa petition; and\n\n, a helpful guide to ensure you are filing a complete and effective petition in support of an H-1B visa petition; and Visa Sponsorship for Employers Video, a brief video narrated by two employment lawyers at Mayer Brown who review visa sponsorship options available to U.S. employers, focusing on H-1B, L-1, O-1 and treaty-based visas.\n\nClick here to get a Practical Guidance free trial.\n\nA wide range of these news, analysis and practice resources are accessible via Lexis+\u00ae General Counsel Suite, providing legal resources, breaking business and legal news and Practical Guidance content.\n\nClick here for a free 7-day trial of Lexis+ GC Suite.",

            "content": "UT\u2019s over 6,600 international students could face changes in the visa process after President Donald Trump sent out an executive order to review the programs on Jan. 20.\n\nThe Trump administration published an executive order asking the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Homeland Security to reevaluate all visa programs, including F-1 visas, by Feb. 19. Review results have not been published at this time.\n\nAccording to Texas Global, the F-1 visa is the most common visa given to international students and extends for the duration of a student\u2019s enrollment in a degree program. It also requires international students to have full-time status with their university and limits their employment to 20 hours per week during the fall and spring semesters. Full-time employment is allowed during vacation periods like summer.\n\nPsychology senior Ryan Wang, an international student from China, said for students who want to stay in the U.S. after graduation, the process becomes much less certain.\n\n\u201cI am also considering maybe New Zealand or Australia, or even Canada because they also offer good (master\u2019s) programs, just not as good as here,\u201d Wang said.\n\nThe order requires agencies to identify \u201ccountries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient\u201d and create a stricter screening process. Although not explicit, these instructions could lead to possible travel bans from targeted countries, immigration attorney Faye Kolly said.\n\n\u201cThe part that we\u2019re most concerned with as practitioners is the part about a potential ban, a travel ban,\u201d Kolly said. \u201cBut there\u2019s also some other things there that are implicit in the executive order that includes increased scrutiny for people from certain countries, (and) all the signaling is that it will be from certain Muslim countries, but it could be any country that the United States has determined it has geopolitical animus with.\u201d\n\nKolly says a consequence of restrictive immigration policies like these is deterring international students from staying in the U.S. after finishing their education or from attending an American university at all, which in turn hurts the economy and universities\u2019 accomplishments.\n\n\u201cIt really stifles innovation,\u201d Kolly said. \u201cThat sort of the multitude of voices that you find so common on university campuses, all the good stuff, and it\u2019s going to hurt the university\u2019s bottom lines.\u201d\n\nComputer science freshman Anish Lotake, an international student from India, said one of his relatives who plans to come to UT to earn their master\u2019s degree grew worried about Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in the US and messaged him about it.\n\n\u201cThis is worrying a lot of people,\u201d Lotake said. \u201c(My relative) plans to come for his masters. He even texted me on WhatsApp, worried about what is happening in the U.S. I would say that people are very scared about ICE, and they just want to make sure that they do everything correctly and be in the U.S. legally.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is still uncertainty over future implementations of these policies, Kolly said staying within the rules of current visas and actively looking for work is key for international students looking to stay in the US.\n\n\u201cMaintaining full-time enrollment in school, applying for your optional practical training or curricular practical training and keeping up your grades, keeping a straight focus on that is number one,\u201d Kolly said. \u201cGoing ahead and applying for the benefits that are available to you post-graduation for optional practical training or your work authorization, and hopefully finding an employer that will be able to sponsor you if you do wish to stay on, will be important.\u201d",

            "content": "The Trump administration issued several executive orders (EOs) in the first week following the inauguration. Many of the EOs for immigration focus on enhancing security measures relating to foreign nationals, including scrutiny of nonimmigrant and immigrant visa applications and enhanced background checks for foreign nationals. At present, no EOs specifically relate to the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, but the enhanced scrutiny the newly issued EOs require may impact EB-5 investors.\n\nEB-5 investors may experience increased scrutiny during Form I-526 or Form I-526E petition adjudication. A critical part of the EB-5 petition process is documenting the lawful funding source the investor used to make the qualifying EB-5 investment. The USCIS Immigrant Investor Program Office may conduct additional background checks on all individuals involved in the funding source, including the investor, his or her spouse, any gift or, and/or any individual or non-bank organization that provides a loan to the investor.\n\nMoreover, EB-5 investors may experience enhanced background checks for EB-5 immigrant visas at U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide. The EO \u201cProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,\u201d tasks government agencies with reviewing all visa programs to prevent hostile state and nonstate actors from entering the United States. This EO likely will result in enhanced background checks of EB-5 investors applying for immigrant visas abroad or for adjustment of status in the United States. Investors born in or who are citizens of countries with a totalitarian or Communist Party-controlled government likely will receive increased scrutiny to determine if they have meaningful membership in the Communist Party. Both USCIS and foreign consular officers likely will also closely examine investors\u2019 memberships in associations or other organizations.\n\nAn additional EO, \u201cGuaranteeing the States Protection Against Invasion,\u201d imposes vetting requirements on immigrants to the United States. This EO might result in enhanced medical and security requirements. The EO \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion\u201d may also result in a more stringent application of the \u201cpublic charge\u201d ground of inadmissibility. EB-5 investors are subject to the \u201cpublic charge\u201d ground of inadmissibility, and they must prove to the USCIS or the consular officer\u2019s satisfaction that they are able to support themselves in the United States and are not likely to take public benefits after being granted permanent residence. USCIS or the State Department may require applicants to submit evidence to prove they would not be a public charge. The administration may expand the list of federal public benefits that can be considered in making a public charge determination. In the I-829 petition adjudication process, USCIS may request evidence on federal public benefits applicants receive.\n\nThe administration\u2019s EOs do not change the EB-5 Program, which Congress extended through Sept. 30, 2027. The EOs generally do not change the EB-5 Program\u2019s rules or eligibility requirements, and applicants from all nations can apply. USCIS and the State Department may implement additional background checks on EB-5 investors at the I-526 or I-526E petition stage, the immigrant visa stage, the adjustment of status stage, and the I-829 petition stage.",

            "content": "For decades, Africans have struggled to travel freely around the continent. Visas to visit fellow African states are hard to secure, costly, and limited in scope. The pan-African dream of unfettered travel between nations \u2013 let alone of arrangements allowing citizens to work and settle in other parts of Africa \u2013 remains a long way from reality.\n\nThere has been no shortage of earnest meetings to discuss the issue. The latest \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d between ministers was held in February on the sidelines of the Africa Union Summit in Addis Ababa. The discussions drew on the release of the Africa Visa Openness Report 2024, which found a mixed picture in the year.\n\nOf 54 countries considered, 17 improved their visa openness score over the year; 29 countries\u2019 scores remain unchanged; and eight countries scored lower. The net effect of the changes was a slightly lower aggregate openness score than in 2023 \u2013 a score on a par with 2022, but higher than the aggregate score in the six prior years.\n\nMajor countries failing\n\nThere is, of course, huge diversity in the performance of individual countries. Benin, Seychelles, the Gambia and Rwanda all achieved perfect scores and, encouragingly, countries with huge populations such as Nigeria and Ethiopia rank in the top 20. But major nations such as Egypt, Algeria and Kenya all rank in the bottom 10, and the Democratic Republic of Congo is ranked just one place outside it.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, several countries have implemented visa policy changes. Some have been bold, instituting positive visa reforms which have resulted in tangible progress towards a more open continent,\u201d the report finds.\n\n\u201cOther policy changes have created new impediments that undermine the ease of movement, resulting in more burdensome travel some citizens. Some of these policy changes relate to domestic or foreign policy, political, security or other concerns.\u201d\n\nOverall, just 28% of countries offer visa-free intraAfrican travel and just 25% offer visas on arrival for intra-African travel. For 47% of intra-Africa travel, Africans need a visa before travelling. In her foreword to the report, Joy Kategekwa, director of the Regional Integration Coordination Office at the African Development Bank, hinted that the \u201cmixed set of findings\u201d showed that the continent is not moving quickly enough to remove barriers.\n\n\u201cWhile some progress has been made since the inaugural edition of the Africa Visa Openness Index, we are far from where we need to be,\u201d she writes. \u201cThat Africans continue to require visas for the most part to enter other African countries is one of the most profound contradictions to the continent\u2019s aspirations on regional integration\u2026 Africa will not meet its development aspirations in the absence of regimes that promote mobility across the continent.\u201d\n\nLook to regional communities\n\nKategekwa says that one way to accelerate progress would be to look to Africa\u2019s regional economic communities (RECs), which she says have pioneered a rights-based approach to movement: the right of citizens from one country in the community to enter, reside and establish themselves in another.\n\nIndeed, in its conclusions, the report says Africa should consider regional visa systems that apply to travel within an entire REC, or at a minimum, cover travel to several REC member states. Higher levels of visa-free reciprocity can be promoted within RECs as a stepping stone to more visa openness. And excess bureaucracy can be tackled, the report says, by introducing e-visas based on secure, reliable, mobile-friendly platforms.\n\nThat should all help to incrementally extend visa-free travel policies to all African Union member states, at the very least for African Continental Free Trade-related business.\n\nThe session in Addis Ababa concluded with the announcement that a 2025 Visa-Free Roadshow will sustain advocacy and mobilise action. One hopes that the travelling policymakers will face no barriers during their trip.",

The system will be incorporated into the existing eKonsulat platform while a new consular e-services platform is in development, according to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Poland has had mixed success with its government-issued mDow\u00f3d digital ID and the mObywatel platform, but significantly more with its bank-issued mojeID.\n\nOver the past years, intermediaries have been using the platform to book visa appointments with the Polish consulate under false names and sell them to foreigners or employers hoping to bring foreign workers. Prices ranged from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Polish employers, including those in the IT sector, say that it has become impossible to book visa appointments for their employees.\n\nUnder the new system, only applicants will be able to book appointments. The identity verification system will first be piloted in India, the Philippines and Uzbekistan which are considered \u201chigh-risk migration nations.\u201d The official launch date is still unknown as the system is still under development, according to the Ministry.\n\nThe country has been facing other problems related to visa issuance. Between 2018 and 2023, Poland has issued over 6 million visas, including 3.8 million work visas. Some were granted with the help of fictitious employment agencies and private universities acting as visa hubs, according to local newspaper Rzeczpospolita.\n\nArticle Topics\n\nbiometrics | fraud prevention | Poland | visas",

(NYSE:V) stands against other growth stock picks by Warren Buffett.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long been a beacon for value investors looking for high-quality businesses with long-term competitive advantages. Since taking over as CEO of Berkshire six decades ago, the appropriately named \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d has outperformed the broader market.\n\nAs we approach 2025, some of Berkshire\u2019s assets stand out as promising opportunities, combining excellent fundamentals with acceptable values despite the market\u2019s sustained emphasis on technology and growth stocks.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s CEO is a strong believer in portfolio concentration. Buffett\u2019s investment strategy revolves around choosing companies with significant competitive advantages, effective management teams, and the potential to create regular free cash flow. His concept focuses on buying exceptional firms at acceptable costs rather than inferior enterprises at low rates. This strategy has proven successful across numerous market cycles, with Berkshire Hathaway providing compound yearly returns significantly higher than market averages over several decades.\n\nThe \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d concentrates on companies he understands, avoiding complex technologies or models with uncertain earnings potential. He looks for companies with pricing power, great brand awareness, and the ability to preserve or grow market share even during economic downturns. Buffett\u2019s conservative yet effective approach has helped him become one of history\u2019s most successful investors.\n\nFollowing the filing of Berkshire\u2019s 13F on February 14, we now know that 60% ($180 billion) of Buffett\u2019s $299 billion portfolio is concentrated in just four magnificent stocks.\n\nJapanese stock investors are attentively watching Buffett\u2019s letter in the hopes of gaining information that may affect the country\u2019s trading houses. Buffett has previously approved Japanese trading companies, resulting in increased stock value. Market participants will examine his comments for clues about the future of these companies, particularly as they are impacted by decreasing energy prices and pressure from the US government to reduce oil expenses.\n\nAs usual, Buffett\u2019s shareholder letter is expected to provide significant insights not only into Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s performance but also into market trends.\n\nGrowth Stock Portfolio: 12 Stock Picks By Warren Buffett\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Warren Buffett\u2019s Q4 2024 portfolio. We then chose 12 stocks with the highest 5-year average revenue growth (YoY) and ranked accordingly.",

            "content": "Photo courtesy Stone County Sheriff's Office\n\nAn area Law Enforcement Agency puts out information about one of the latest attempts scammers try to get personal credit card information.\n\nThe information below comes from the Stone County Sheriff's Office.:\n\nThis is a heads up for everyone regarding the latest in Visa fraud. This is happening in the Midwest right now and moving across the country. This one is pretty slick, since they provide YOU with all the information, except the one piece they want.\n\nNote, the callers do not ask for your card number; they already have it.\n\nThis information is worth reading. By understanding how the VISA & MasterCard telephone Credit Card Scam works, you'll be better prepared to protect yourself. The scam works like this:\n\nPerson calling says - 'This is (name) and I'm calling from the Security and Fraud Department at VISA. My Badge number is 12460, your card has been flagged for an unusual purchase pattern, and I'm calling to verify. This would be on your VISA card which was issued by (name of bank). Did you purchase an Anti-Telemarketing Device for $497.99 from a marketing company based in Arizona?' (or something like this) When you say 'No', the caller continues with, 'Then we will be issuing a credit to your account. This is a company we have been watching, and the charges range from $297 to $497, just under the $500 purchase pattern that flags most cards. Before your next statement, the credit will be sent to (gives you your address). Is that correct?' You say 'yes'.\n\nThe caller continues - 'I will be starting a Fraud Investigation. If you have any questions, you should call the 1- 800 number listed on the back of your card (1-800-VISA) and ask for Security. You will need to refer to this Control Number. The caller then gives you a 6 digit number. 'Do you need me to read it again?'\n\nHere's the IMPORTANT part on how the scam works - The caller then says, 'I need to verify you are in possession of your card'. He'll ask you to 'turn your card over and look for some numbers'. There are 7 numbers; the first 4 are part of your card number, the last 3 are the Security Numbers that verify you are the possessor of the card. These are the numbers you sometimes use to make Internet purchases to prove you have the card. The caller will ask you to read the last 3 numbers to him. After you tell the caller the 3 numbers, he'll say, 'That is correct, I just needed to verify that the card has not been lost or stolen, and that you still have your card. Do you have any other questions?'\n\nAfter you say no, the caller then thanks you and states, 'Don't hesitate to call back if you do', and hangs up. You actually say very little, and they never ask for or tell you the card number. The REAL VISA Security Department says this is a scam and what happens is that once you provide them with the 3 digit security code, a new purchase of $497.99 (or whatever they said) gets charged. What the Scammer wants is the 3-digit PIN number on the back of the card. Don't give it to them. Instead, tell them you'll call VISA or Master Card directly for verification of their conversation.\n\nThe real VISA will never ask for anything on the card, as they already know the information, since they issued the card! If you give the Scammer your 3 Digit PIN Number, you think you're receiving a credit. However, by the time you get your statement you'll see charges for purchases you didn't make, and by then it's more difficult to actually file a fraud report.\n\nIf you receive a call like this HANG UP! and call the number on the back of your card to verify if there has been any suspicious activity on your account.",

This marks the first ASEAN-based tour group to visit since China launched its new visa relaxation policy.\n\nAs of February 10, visitors from ASEAN countries are now permitted to explore Xishuangbanna, a renowned tourist spot in Yunnan Province, for up to six days without the need for a visa.\n\nChina and ASEAN nations have long been vital tourism partners. Official figures reveal that in 2024, Xishuangbanna hosted 319,500 international tourists, reflecting a remarkable 264.67% increase from the previous year. Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar were the primary contributors.\n\nThis visa exemption initiative is seen as a new chapter in the cultural exchange and collaboration between China and ASEAN, according to Qi Xiaobo from the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research. It highlights China\u2019s commitment to deepening relationships with the regional bloc.\n\nThe tourists, guided by a local agency, enjoyed the region\u2019s natural beauty, sampled its local cuisine, and immersed themselves in the Dai ethnic culture, which included traditional dance performances and water blessing ceremonies.\n\nJiang Jie, deputy director of Xishuangbanna\u2019s Culture and Tourism Bureau, noted that 18 new tourist routes have been introduced, showcasing the area\u2019s rich heritage and culture.\n\nThe influx of visitors is a significant boon for the hospitality sector, travel agencies, and other related industries, while also contributing to infrastructure growth, Qi emphasized. He stressed the importance of improving services for international tourists, such as multilingual guides and financial support systems.\n\nCultural exchanges between China and ASEAN are extending beyond tourism. With the increasing influence of Chinese culture in the region, more people from ASEAN countries are keen to learn the Chinese language.\n\nLe Anh Lien, a 24-year-old from Vietnam, works at a cross-border food shop in Tianbao Port, Malipo County, where her Mandarin skills helped her secure employment. A report from VietnamWorks, a Vietnamese job platform, showed that students proficient in Chinese have near 100% success in finding employment after graduation.\n\nThe number of Lao students learning Chinese is also on the rise, with many pursuing studies in areas like logistics, e-commerce, tourism, and sports management. Zhou Bo, a vocational school head in Xishuangbanna\u2019s Mengla County, shared that over 500 new Lao students are expected to join the school soon.\n\nFigures show that more than 175,000 exchange students now move between China and ASEAN countries, with joint educational initiatives expanding and enhancing the talent pool for both sides.\n\nJia Chaozhishan of the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences concluded, \u201cPeople-to-people exchanges between China and ASEAN have entered a new phase, with growing cooperation in tourism, culture, and beyond.\u201d\n\nShare On:",

            "content": "If approved in April, the House v. NCAA settlement will allow a system of revenue-sharing between Division I schools and athletes for the first time in college sports history. But one group of athletes might have difficulty getting paid.\n\nInternational athletes on student visas may be in violation of U.S. immigration laws if they accept revenue-sharing payments this July, multiple immigration attorneys tell Front Office Sports. It\u2019s a concern that could impact tens of thousands of international NCAA athletes, most of whom generally use student visas.\n\nIf they violate their visa status and their visas are revoked, the consequences could go much further than lost NIL (name, image, and likeness) earnings. Athletes are at risk of losing the opportunity to study in the U.S., as they\u2019re required to either change status or leave the country within 30 days. After that, they could be deported\u2014or even be hit with a reentry ban if they stay longer than six months.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing that nobody\u2019s talking about enough when it comes to international kids\u2019 NIL: [the] House [settlement],\u201d says Green and Spiegel immigration attorney Ksenia Maiorova.\n\nExperts have not reached a consensus on the best way to approach the issue just months before the House settlement could be implemented\u2014and during a presidential administration that Maiorova calls \u201cvery enforcement-minded.\u201d\n\nInternational students usually come to the U.S. to study on \u201cF class,\u201d or student visas, which have strict rules barring almost all kinds of work while they\u2019re in the U.S. with just a few exceptions. Athletes are allowed to receive \u201cpassive\u201d income, or do a limited amount of work that is directly related to the degrees they\u2019re pursuing. But the prevailing sentiment from legal experts who spoke to FOS is that international athletes could violate their visa if they participate in NIL deals\u2014a conundrum about 25,000 international NCAA players across all three divisions have faced since 2021.\n\nIn the past, international athletes have dealt with the NIL immigration issue a few different ways. They could simply refuse if they didn\u2019t want to risk losing their visas, or experiment with workarounds if they were willing to take a risk: Former Kentucky basketball player Oscar Tshiebwe, for example, participated in several NIL deals while at a men\u2019s basketball tournament off U.S. soil, in the Bahamas, and Northwestern State basketball player Hansel Emmanuel, who went viral for playing with only one arm, was able to qualify for an \u201cO class\u201d visa, which is awarded to immigrants with \u201cexceptional abilities\u201d and allows for NIL deals.\n\nScott Utterback-Imagn Images\n\nBut the House v. NCAA settlement would have schools dole out payments to their entire athletic department\u2014so it\u2019s virtually unavoidable for any athlete. The payments could violate the worker regulations of student visa laws whether they\u2019re considered NIL agreements or the manifestation of an employee-employer relationship, the attorneys agreed.\n\nSchools face a new challenge, too: Schools paying international athletes could face their own run-ins with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, given that it\u2019s illegal to pay workers who are unauthorized to work in the United States.\n\nPlayers aware of the issue are enlisting lawyers to help them apply for different types of visas, or at the very least receive advice about whether they\u2019re in danger of losing their visas if they take the House payments. Aaron Blumberg, a partner at Fragomen law firm, says they seem somewhat more knowledgeable about the visa landscape\u2014and how it relates to NIL\u2014than they did just a few years ago.\n\nBlumberg says high-profile D-I clients he works with appear aware of the issue. But some school administrators are wholly unaware that the problem exists at all, let alone what their plans are to protect their athletes\u2014or themselves, Maiorova says.\n\nWhile the NCAA has taken the public position that athletes should be able to benefit, it has neither control over the situation nor guidance on how schools should approach the House settlement.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security could release guidance allowing them to do so\u2014or saying they wouldn\u2019t enforce revenue-sharing as a visa violation. Congress could also pass a law saying as much.\n\nBut to date, DHS has not issued any guidance. And Congress never succeeded in passing existing legislation on the subject\u2014despite outside advocacy efforts. None of the experts FOS spoke with believe that guidance is imminent\u2014or that athletes should bank on it. A Student and Exchange Visitor Program spokesperson said, \u201cCurrently, international student athletes cannot profit from their NIL deals. Any changes to visa restrictions will be communicated through legislative and department channels and SEVP will provide updates through Study in the States, social media, and field representatives.\u201d\n\nImmigration attorney Sherrod Seward, as well as Maiorova, don\u2019t see a workaround for House v. NCAA payments beyond athletes getting on different types of visas. \u201cWe can call it whatever we want to,\u201d Maiorova says. \u201cWe can play games of semantics. But at the end of the day \u2026 direct payments are the manifestation of our collective recognition that this is pay-for-play. And if it\u2019s pay-for-play, then it\u2019s services\u2014it\u2019s labor.\u201d\n\nAdam Cairns-Imagn Images\n\nThey aren\u2019t enthusiastic about alternate interpretations or workarounds, especially since the Trump Administration has directed immigration authorities to crack down on potential compliance violations. \u201cI advise the players,\u201d Seward says, \u201cnot to cash the [House] check.\u201d\n\nBlumberg, on the other hand, is prepared to argue on behalf of clients that House payment deals could be classified as \u201cpassive\u201d income, like participating in group licensing agreements for schools to sell apparel or other products, rather than payment for labor. Blumberg says he is advising many clients to bank on this interpretation, as long as they ensure that players don\u2019t do any additional NIL \u201cactivities\u201d (like autograph sessions or posing for photo shoots).\n\nBut he says that players and schools have to do their own personal risk analysis. Some, who could be in line for major paydays, may find it worth it to risk the wrath of ICE\u2014especially if they don\u2019t intend to stay in the U.S. permanently. Others, who may not earn much in NIL or who may be up for a green card, could act more conservatively.\n\n\u201cAs long as [schools and athletes] understand the risks and the fact that the risks are a little greater now than they were maybe six months ago, I think it\u2019s a very valid decision,\u201d Blumberg says.",

As we move into 2025, several significant changes are set to reshape the landscape of this vital program. Whether you\u2019re an employer or a prospective applicant, understanding these updates is crucial for navigating the H-1B process effectively.\n\nH-1B Visa 2025 Update\n\nH-1B Visa 2025 Update\n\nFeature Details Effective Date January 17, 2025 Registration Period March 7, 2025 \u2013 March 24, 2025 Registration Fee Increased to $215 per beneficiary Selection Process Beneficiary-centric approach Form Update Revised Form I-129 effective January 17, 2025 Official Source USCIS H-1B Program Updates\n\nOverview of the H-1B Visa Program\n\nThe H-1B visa allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in positions that require specialized knowledge. Common industries utilizing H-1B visas include technology, engineering, healthcare, and academia. Traditionally, the program has been highly competitive, with demand often exceeding the annual cap of 85,000 visas.\n\nH-1B Visa 2025 Updates Effective January 17, 2025\n\n1. Implementation of the H-1B Modernization Rule\n\nOn January 17, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented the H-1B Modernization Rule. This rule aims to:\n\nStreamline the Approval Process : Simplifying procedures to make it more efficient for employers to hire foreign talent.\n\n: Simplifying procedures to make it more efficient for employers to hire foreign talent. Enhance Program Flexibility : Allowing employers greater adaptability in managing their H-1B workforce.\n\n: Allowing employers greater adaptability in managing their H-1B workforce. Strengthen Integrity and Oversight: Introducing measures to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with program requirements.\n\n2. Revised Definition of \u201cSpecialty Occupation\u201d\n\nThe Modernization Rule includes a revised definition of \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d, clarifying the criteria for positions eligible under the H-1B program. This aims to ensure that only roles requiring specialized knowledge and qualifications are filled by H-1B workers.\n\n3. Protections for F-1 Students\n\nThe new regulations provide enhanced protections for certain F-1 students, facilitating a smoother transition from student status to H-1B employment. This includes provisions that allow students to remain in the U.S. while their H-1B petitions are pending.\n\n4. Codification of Deference Policy\n\nUSCIS has codified a long-standing deference policy, meaning that prior determinations made in favor of an employer\u2019s H-1B petitions will generally be given deference in subsequent petitions, provided the underlying facts remain unchanged. This offers greater predictability for employers seeking to extend or amend H-1B employment.\n\nH-1B Cap Registration for Fiscal Year 2026\n\nRegistration Period\n\nThe registration period for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 H-1B cap opens at noon ET on March 7, 2025, and closes at noon ET on March 24, 2025. During this time, employers must submit registrations for each prospective H-1B employee through the USCIS online system.\n\nIncreased Registration Fee\n\nThe registration fee has been increased to $215 per beneficiary, applicable to each prospective employee an employer registers during the H-1B cap season. This adjustment reflects efforts to cover administrative costs associated with the registration process.\n\nBeneficiary-Centric Selection Process\n\nUSCIS continues to utilize the beneficiary-centric selection process, introduced in FY 2025. Under this approach, registrations are selected based on unique beneficiaries rather than multiple submissions, aiming to provide a fairer allocation of H-1B visas.\n\nUpdated Form I-129\n\nEffective January 17, 2025, USCIS has released a revised Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. This updated form reflects changes associated with the H-1B and H-2 final rules and must be used for all H-1B petitions moving forward.\n\nPractical Steps for Employers and Applicants\n\nFor Employers\n\nReview Updated Regulations: Familiarize yourself with the H-1B Modernization Rule and revised definitions to ensure compliance. Budget for Increased Fees: Account for the $215 registration fee per beneficiary in your hiring budget. Prepare for Registration: Gather necessary information and submit registrations within the March 7\u201324 window. Utilize the Revised Form I-129: Ensure all H-1B petitions use the updated form starting January 17, 2025.\n\nFor Applicants\n\nUnderstand Eligibility Criteria: Review the revised \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d definition to confirm your position qualifies. Coordinate with Employers: Communicate with your prospective employer to ensure timely registration and petition filing. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of any additional updates from USCIS that may affect your application.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)",

These officers receive rigorous training on applying visa law and regulation before they reach their posting overseas.\n\n\u201cBecause so many factors influence each visa adjudication, there is no one reason why a refusal rate goes up or down.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, while new enrolments have decreased, according to new Open Doors data, Iranian students in the US totalled 12,430 in 2023/24 \u2013 a 15% increase on the previous year and the fourth largest rise of any country.\n\nThough seeming to contradict the decrease in new visas granted, the rise could be explained by an increase in Iranian graduates staying on in the US for OPT work opportunities, which drove the overall record-high numbers of international students in the US.\n\nIranian Applicants Visa Movement\n\nIn response to declining visa issuance last year, the group of academics established a Telegram group of F and J visa applicants. They collated data about the courses, institutions and embassies where students\u2019 applications were rejected, as well as visa processing delays and the time and money spent by prospective students.\n\nSince the closure of the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, there has been no US diplomatic presence in Iran and prospective students must schedule visa appointments at US embassies or consulates in neighbouring countries such as Turkey, the UAE or Armenia, making visa processing and wait times difficult to record.\n\nUnder regulations from the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Iranian students are permitted to apply for non-immigrant visas to attend academic institutions in the US, though there are some restrictions on research collaborations.\n\nThe refusal rate is a product of millions of individual decisions made every day by our consular officers around the world US State Department\n\nIn October 2024, the Iranian applicants\u2019 movement disseminated a survey among the applicants. Of the 402 students on the Telegram group, 79 individuals responded about their experiences.\n\nThe results found that of the rejected applicants, 53% were PhD students, 37% were master\u2019s students and 5% were post doctorate researchers.\n\nThe largest proportion of applicants (40.5%) travelled to Yerevan, Armenia, for their visa appointment, followed by Dubai, UAE, and Doha, Qatar, which received 15% and 14% of students respectively.\n\nThe survey recorded students\u2019 scholarship status, revealing that 54% had fully funded scholarships, 20% had partially funded scholarships, and 18% were self-funded.\n\nSpanning a wide variety of degrees, the postgraduate students and researchers had been accepted to institutions including UMass Boston, the University of Illinois and the University of California Merced.\n\nCost & wait times\n\nOf the 79 respondents, many applied for a visa more than once, with 68% attending a second appointment and 22% a third.\n\nFour students attempted a fourth time, and two students had five unsuccessful visa interviews, spending an estimated total of more than $3,700 on travel costs, visa appointment fees and currency transaction fees.\n\nOn top of accommodation and travel fees to US embassies in neighbouring countries, F and J visa applicants must pay a $185 MRV fee for each consulate interview, as well as a $350 SEVIS fee that is valid for one year.\n\nDue to global economic sanctions, Iran\u2019s currency has the second lowest global worth, with each applicant paying an estimated additional $200 in transaction fees for each visa appointment.\n\nAdministrative Processing\n\nAccording to the academics, many of the applicants have been waiting in Administrative Processing (AP) at US embassies, putting their academic plans on hold.\n\nAn applicant is placed in AP in situation where a consular officer determines they need more information about an application, placing the applicant in AP for an indeterminate period.\n\nAccording to the Iranian Applicants Movement, 30 students have been waiting for their visa clearance since 2022 and 160 students have been waiting since 2023, though these figures have not been independently verified by the individual applicants.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nSince Trump reassumed the presidency on January 20, a \u201ctsunami\u201d of executive orders have been unleashed, threatening to reshape the immigration system and radically alter the face of US international higher education.\n\nDespite these, as well as Trump\u2019s hardline stance against Iran seen in his policy of \u201cMaximum Pressure\u201d on oil exports, Barbod and his colleagues remain hopeful that the administration might take a more positive stance towards Iranian students.\n\nThis optimism is, in large, driven by secretary of state Marco Rubio\u2019s comments in which he made a distinction between the people of Iran and their government.\n\n\u201cI hope he will understand our grave concern and facilitate the process of Iranian student visas,\u201d said Barbod.\n\nBarbod also pointed to Elon Musk\u2019s campaign trail comments on X, formerly known as Twitter, maintaining that \u201cAmerica has benefitted from an influx of talented Iranians\u201d, while acknowledging the highly unpredictable nature of the current administration.\n\n** Real names have been changed",

            "content": "This winter term, the Palaeopitus Senior Society announced a partnership with the Office of Visa and Immigration Services to support undergraduate students applying for B-2 tourist visas for international family members to attend Commencement.\n\nPalaeopitus has sent periodic campus-wide emails inviting students of all class years to complete an anonymous survey about Commencement visa needs. According to the emails, responses will help Palaeopitus customize resources and advocate for the College to provide more tourist visa application support.\n\nAccording to OVIS director Susan Ellison, a B-2 visa permits temporary entry to the United States for \u201cpleasure,\u201d characterized as any legitimate activities of a recreational nature. In order for an application to be approved, an applicant must establish that they have the funds to support themselves during the temporary stay and that they intend to return to their residence abroad at the conclusion of their stay, Ellison added.\n\nPalaeopitus member Kiosha Fowlkes \u201925 said she suggested the initiative in the fall and has been spearheading the project.\n\n\u201cA lot of times I heard [other students say] \u2018people from my country [say] they\u2019re not able to access resources here at Dartmouth to support them,\u2019\u201d Fowlkes said. \u201cSo when I applied [for Palaeopitus], I [decided] this is one of the initiatives I\u2019d like to bring to the board and have us work on.\u201d\n\nFowlkes said she learned more about B-2 visas through her immigration internship at Northeast New Jersey Legal Services \u2014 which provides free legal assistance to low-income residents of New Jersey. She then researched the application process and outlined resources that Dartmouth can offer to support international students, such as additional government resources linked on the OVIS website.\n\nEllison wrote that Palaeopitus reached out to OVIS requesting that it add more information about the classification and application process of B-2 visas on its website.\n\n\u201cThe group shared additional information and references to government resources that they thought would be helpful, and we incorporated many of their suggestions into additional content created by OVIS staff which now appears on the website,\u201d Ellison wrote.\n\nFowlkes said the survey received 64 responses and that Palaeopitus is currently processing the responses to address student needs. Palaeopitus made the survey anonymous to allow students to provide as much information as possible about their concerns, she added.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to know what concerns [students] may have for their families coming over,\u201d Fowlkes said. \u201cSo that was a component of the survey \u2014 gathering all their concerns and also gathering how well they feel supported by Dartmouth right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fowlkes, the base price for a B-2 visa application is $185, with additional fees depending on the applicant\u2019s home country. Ellison wrote that U.S. embassies and consulates follow guidance from the U.S. Department of State to review and adjudicate B-2 visa applications. Fowlkes said the survey included a question on whether the application fee would be a financial burden to the student, and added that many respondents said they would be open to receiving \u201cfinancial support.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talked to the financial aid office, and they weren\u2019t super open to the idea of funding applications for that, or having sort of financial involvement and supporting senior families to come here,\u201d Fowlkes said.\n\nBecause of this, Fowlkes said she has spoken to members of the Coalition for Immigration Reform and Equality at Dartmouth, a student group advocating for undocumented students about their Immigrant Senior Support Fund sourced via donations. The $5,000 fund aims to financially assist domestic travel for families of first and second-generation immigrant students for Commencement.\n\nAccording to Fowlkes, a \u201cmajority\u201d of survey responses said their families\u2019 B-2 applications were still in progress.\n\n\u201cA lot of them indicated that they would still need support in whatever stage they are right now in their application process,\u201d Fowlkes said. \u201cSo that also indicates that there\u2019s a need.\u201d\n\nEllison said that OVIS has a family invitation letter template for students to send to their respective embassies. However, according to Fowlkes and an anonymous international student, other colleges officially sign these letters and give them to the students to submit with their applications.\n\n\u201cHarvard even provides family invitation letters for [students] \u2014 like, they will have [university] employees sign off on it [for] the U.S. embassies,\u201d Fowlkes said.\n\nThe anonymous student said they attempted to have OVIS write a letter confirming they are graduating this spring. The letter would have been included in the student\u2019s mother\u2019s B-2 visa application, which was ultimately rejected three weeks into the process.\n\n\u201c[OVIS] said they don\u2019t give out letters nowadays, which I don\u2019t know if that had [boosted] my chances or not, because, at least for some of my friends from other schools, they were able to get their schools to [send out the letters],\u201d the anonymous student said.\n\nAccording to Ellison, the U.S. Department of State has \u201cconsistently\u201d provided written guidance that these letters do not factor into the decision to approve or deny a B-2 visa application.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the visa process can be complex and stressful for international students and their families,\u201d Ellison wrote. \u201cWhile we cannot influence B-2 visa application decisions, we are committed to supporting our international students.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous student said they followed the OVIS letter guide.\n\n\u201cI [wish] the school could support the international student community better because I feel \u2026 this would have been the one chance my parents perhaps could have supported me in this journey,\u201d the student said. \u201cThat would have been nice, but it sucks. It\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the First Generation Office director Jay Davis, the King Scholars Program \u2014 which provides four-year scholarships to low-income international students interested in addressing social issues in their home countries \u2014 funds two family members\u2019 graduation-related travel expenses for each scholar.\n\n\u201c[Commencement] is an amazing opportunity to bring their families,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut if the visa isn\u2019t approved \u2014 and we had several who were not approved last year \u2014 just they didn\u2019t [get approved or] they didn\u2019t get their meeting in time.\u201d\n\nCorrection Appended (Feb. 25, 1:16 p.m.): A previous version of this article stated that other colleges send letters of invitation to embassies. Other colleges sign these letters but do not send them to embassies themselves, according to the Harvard International Office. The article has been corrected. The article has also updated a quote by Fowlkes to clarify that she was referring to the experiences of international students, not her own.",

            "content": "The dancehall legend Beenie Man has been a global superstar since the 1990s, wining both a Grammy and a British Mobo award, but for more than a decade, he was unable to enter the United States.\n\nSo it was a particular triumph this week to find himself on US soil, as a guest of honour at the governor of the US Virgin Islands\u2019 mansion, after finally securing a visa for people with extraordinary ability in the arts.\n\nBeenie Man described the moment as a high point in his career, telling the Guardian that the 10-year ban \u2013 excluding him from one of the biggest markets for Caribbean music \u2013 had been disastrous for his career.\n\n\u201cThe work in the United States is different from the work in Europe or the work in Africa. Because you can go to Africa about one to two times a year, but you can go to America every week because you have 50 different states plus territories,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do four or five shows in New York \u2026 You can do upstate New York, you can do Manhattan, you can do Queens, you can do Brooklyn and you can do the Bronx. So it\u2019s very important for any artist to have that access.\u201d\n\nThe US Virgin Islands governor, Albert Bryan Jr, said: \u201cIt was awesome to meet the man that livened plenty of dancehalls for me. Welcoming him to the Virgin Islands was a special pleasure, not only for the privilege of meeting him but the joy I know his music brings to people.\u201d\n\nHis attorney Bridgette Bennett \u2013 dubbed the \u201creggae visa lawyer\u201d after winning a string of complex US immigration cases for Jamaican musicians \u2013 said no clear reason was ever given for Beenie Man\u2019s visa refusals.\n\n\u201cA big part of my challenge was dissecting the situation and understanding why they were denying my client. There is a concept in immigration called \u2018inadmissibility\u2019 that is written into the Immigration and Nationality Act. So they will check off on a little piece of paper saying you are inadmissible under this section of the law. And sometimes \u2026 they will not give specifics, but just point to a general area of the law,\u201d she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Beenie Man performs during Yam Carnival 2021 at Clapham Common on 28 August 2021 in London, England. Photograph: Lorne Thomson/Redferns\n\nThe US-based attorney, who originally got into immigration law when her then husband, a Jamaican entertainer, was facing deportation said her arguments had focused on touring artists\u2019 economic value.\n\n\u201cI usually make arguments on the economic benefits of having live performances. And I have lots of research showing that performers bring in jobs and billions of dollars. Their tours generate a lot of benefits for the US. I also talk about cultural enrichment,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Beenie Man, real name Moses Anthony Davis, the visa ban was just the latest hurdle among many he has encountered in his music career, which started when he was just seven years old.\n\nAs a child, he had a severe stutter, but he discovered that it disappeared when he sang.\n\n\u201cI never got into music. Music was born inside of me because when I was a kid I used to stutter, and music allowed me to be able to have this conversation with you now,\u201d Beenie Man said.\n\n\u201cI used to sing the reading book, I used to sing the shopping list on my way to the shop. Then I started to put two and two together and make some songs. So this music really gave me a voice so I can speak to people.\u201d\n\nAt seven Beenie Man won his first music contest, by eight he had put out his debut single Too Fancy and at 10 he released his first album, The Invincible Beenie Man: The Ten Year Old DJ Wonder.\n\nAn incident in 1991 might have torpedoed his career, when he performed a song about \u201cgreen arm\u201d \u2013 or smelly armpits \u2013 at an event honouring Nelson Mandela, who was visiting Jamaica.\n\n\u201cI remember the day and time like it was today,\u201d said Beenie Man, allowing that the choice was a mistake.\n\n\u201cI sang the wrong song at the wrong time. And yeah I got booed. So I decided that that would never happen to me again. So from there on, I became the man that I am today. I just push forward, push forward, nonstop, just pushing forward right through.\u201d\n\nBeenie Man, who has a Jamaican Order of Distinction for his contributions to music, said that a return to performance in the US was a chance to be a cultural ambassador for Jamaica, a country whose music is central to its identity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWithout our culture, you have no country. Can you imagine if we stop talking about the Maroons who freed themselves from slavery? Can you imagine if we erase our iconic musicians and poets like [the poet and activist] Miss Lou, Bob Marley and Desmond Dekker \u2013 all of these great people who made the music what it is today? Can you imagine if we stop speaking about them and focus only on those promoting violence and ignorance?\n\n\u201cWe have to realise that we set the culture, and we preserve the culture. What we don\u2019t want to do is to freak out the culture and make the youth become vultures. Proper music and proper performances. That means, dealing with people in the right way. So If you have to take a hundred pictures, you stand up and take 100 pictures. You can\u2019t be too tired to take 100 pictures when you have 10,000 people pay to come to your show,\u201d he added.",

            "content": "Due to some family issues, I\u2019ve been back and forth from the United States more often than usual, an issue when you don\u2019t have Mexican residency. Also due to these issues, I\u2019m not always thinking with the utmost clarity and poise. So when the immigration officer in Mexico City\u2019s Benito Juarez International Airport asked me how long I was planning to stay in Mexico on my tourist visa, I said something really out of character: \u201ctwo weeks.\u201d\n\nLet me explain. I\u2019ve had every intention of getting my residency and it\u2019s been on my radar for over a year. However, as a freelance writer, my income is never quite steady enough to fulfill the required obligations for economic solvency. Nor is my savings as robust as the Mexican government would deem fit. I\u2019ve been in a limbo of searching for other ways to get the coveted card, so in the meantime, I\u2019ve been sneakily throwing off the immigration officers every time I re-enter Mexico by claiming I\u2019d be staying for varying lengths of time. Sometimes I\u2019d say three months, other times I\u2019d say four months \u2014 whatever I said until now, it never mattered. I\u2019d receive a stamp of 180 days and that would be that.\n\nUntil that fateful afternoon on Jan. 5, when the otherwise friendly officer stamped my passport and wrote \u201c30 d\u00edas.\u201dI could feel the meltdown coming right there on the ramp that takes you from immigration to the exit doors.\n\nThe hunt for residency begins\n\nAs soon as I got home I started my search. Where could I go to return to Mexico and get my rightful 180 days? I looked at Colombia. Terrible flights. I looked at Ecuador. A weekend wouldn\u2019t be enough. I considered the U.S. again. Too soon. Remembering I had a trip to Bacalar coming up, I looked at ferries to Belize.\n\n\u201cI did that once,\u201d a British friend informed me. \u201cWhen I got back to Mexico, they only gave me seven days on my tourist visa.\u201d He\u2019s not the only one. A rapid Google search indicated that travelers of all nationalities had the same experience returning to Mexico from Belize.\n\nSuddenly, it dawned on me. Isn\u2019t there some way to get residency when you overstay your tourist visa?\n\nEnter \u201cRegularizaci\u00f3n por documento vencido,\u201d or the expired document regularization program.\n\nThis procedure allows foreign nationals with expired tourist visas to apply for temporary residency without having to travel to a consulate abroad or prove economic solvency.\n\nMeet the facilitator\n\nI immediately hired a facilitator, a common route for foreigners on the road to residency. Mine was recommended by two friends so I felt completely at ease handing over my address, passport and\u2026banking statements?\n\nIt seemed that, despite the information the internet had provided me, I would need to prove economic solvency.\n\nI sent six months of banking statements from two separate accounts that showed I just grazed the monthly minimum. I was assured that the balances wouldn\u2019t be scrutinized and I wouldn\u2019t have to prove that deposits were income-specific, something I was told I\u2019d have to do when applying for economic solvency.\n\nMy facilitator told me that he would send my information to the immigration office to make sure I was eligible to apply. A day later, my application was granted. The next day, he personally came to collect my passport and let me know he would meet me at the National Migration Institute (INM) in Polanco on Thursday at 8:30 a.m.\n\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I took the grueling Uber ride in rush hour to Polanco. Upon arrival at 8:24 a.m. I texted my facilitator as I couldn\u2019t find him in the crowd of immigrant hopefuls. He messaged me several minutes later and said he was at the front of the line. He had a packet of immigration papers printed which required a few signatures, my passport and my banking statement. He introduced me to his colleague, a 30-something Mexican woman with a lovely jacket, and informed me that she had been waiting in line since 6 a.m.\n\nInto the INM\n\nAt 9 a.m., the doors opened. Having paid a hefty sum for assistance, I was slightly confused as to why I was supposed to arrive 30 minutes prior just to wait around and make small talk. We went inside, but the facilitator stayed outside.\n\nBy 9:30, it was clear that I had no appointment and would have to come back the following Tuesday at 9 a.m.. Again, confused, as I thought booking my appointment ahead of time and online was what I had partially paid for, I left the packet of papers with the facilitator, took my passport and went home.\n\nFast forward to Tuesday. I arrive at 8:30 a.m. sharp and I see my facilitator\u2019s colleague waiting toward the front of the line. We make more small talk for 15 minutes and I ask where the facilitator is, as he has all my required forms. He\u2019s on his way. Five minutes later, he arrives, and I\u2019m again unsure as to why I had to be here at 8:30.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019re probably wondering why I didn\u2019t just say something. The answer is I hate confrontation, and at that point I just wanted to get on with the process and be done with it.\n\nSecond time\u2019s the charm\n\nAgain we go up to the rotunda, only this time, instead of signing in, we\u2019re told to sit in a section to the left and wait for my name to be called. It only takes about 10 minutes before I hear Bet-han-ee Plat-a-neyya and bolt to the desk.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a writer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your monthly income?\u201d\n\n\u201c$4,200.\u201d That, by the way, is nothing more than the required amount to apply for economic solvency.\n\nShe tells me to sit and wait to be called again. I chat with the facilitator\u2019s colleague while realizing my bank statements were utterly unnecessary.\n\nThe office worker calls me up at 11 AM. I now must move to a different section. At this point, the facilitator\u2019s colleague is no longer able to accompany me, and goes outside until I\u2019m done.\n\nThe second section is for payment. I stand in a 20-minute line before I\u2019m able to participate in what looks like a game of musical chairs. Each time a person is called to the counter to make a payment, everyone moves one seat over. This Snake-like dynamic continues for over an hour, when it\u2019s finally my turn to pay. I spend at least 45 minutes standing at the payment counter.\n\nThe very sweet officer asks me again about my job and monthly income. He shuffles stacks of papers, clicks on his keyboard, makes copies and asks me to sign eight receipts that somehow coincide with the three payments I\u2019m required to make to acquire a four-year residency permit. Those were the following:\n\nApplication fee: 1,780 pesos Fine for overstaying my tourist visa: 11,201 pesos A four-year residency permit: 12,529 pesos\n\nThe total cost of my regularization, not including facilitator\u2019s fee, was 25,510 pesos.\n\nResident at last\n\nI am officially invited to the third and final section. When I get there, a woman in uniform barks at me to show my passport before grunting for me to sit down. I sit before a collection of heavily lipsticked women in uniform, each tapping away at their respective computers or taking photos of newly-minted residents for their ID cards.\n\nThe most soft-spoken woman of the bunch calls me over.\n\nShe inquires about my birthdate, my height in centimeters and my address, and orders me to remove my jewelry. She takes three photos, a headshot and two profiles. She tells me to sit in the waiting area. Two minutes later while I\u2019m still fiddling with the clasp on my necklace, she holds up a card. I dash toward her.\n\nI receive another stack of papers which include a migration document with my Unique Population Registry Code, or CURP, an 18-character alphanumeric code that identifies every Mexican and resident, along with my shiny beige-colored residency card. Despite the horrible fish-eye camera angle that makes me look like a literal alien in addition to a legal one, I feel myself choke up a little. This is a monumental moment in my life! It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been an official resident of another country and, despite the six hours I\u2019ve spent waiting in lines, it was a relatively easy process.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, you\u2019re probably wondering one thing.\n\nWas it worth hiring a facilitator to get Mexican residency through regularization?\n\nWould I recommend getting a facilitator to anyone else?\n\nThe short answer? No.\n\n\n\nThe medium answer? No. Beyond the misgivings I\u2019ve mentioned in this article, I can\u2019t verify that there is any instance where the immigration office needs to approve your eligibility to apply prior to your appointment. I could be wrong, but I\u2019m having a hard time proving it.\n\nThe long answer? It might depend on the program you\u2019re applying for. It also could be useful if administrative processes in another language stress you out. In my personal experience applying for expired visa regularization, I feel strongly that I could have done this myself and saved 5,000 pesos, which I would have happily spent on another trip to Bacalar, this time with a ferry ride to Belize.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not reflect the views of Mexico News Daily or its affiliates\n\nBethany Platanella is a travel planner and lifestyle writer based in Mexico City.

That includes consumer and commercial card use on UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JCB, Discover and Diners Club cards.\n\nReport predicted last month. That includes consumer and commercial card use on UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JCB, Discover and Diners Club cards. The Asia-Pacific region will experience the biggest increase (46.8%) while the U.S. will see the smallest rise (27%), according to the Nilson forecast, which only included cards tied to global networks and not domestic-only networks.\n\nThe predictions echo trends seen over the past decade as the number of U.S. card transactions more than doubled, but also showed the smallest increase relative to markets worldwide, Nilson statistics showed.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe slower U.S. growth rate reflects a maturing market, with the first modern credit card emerging in the country in 1950 with the arrival of the Diners Club card. Other card networks soon followed over the next two decades when predecessors to the now familiar Visa and Mastercard brands were born. Eventually, card use began to spread to other parts of the world.\n\nToday, Visa is the largest network in the U.S., followed by Mastercard, but Visa is only the second-largest in the world, behind China\u2019s UnionPay International.\n\nU.S. card transactions jumped 111% between 2014 and 2024, while the combined Middle East and Africa region experienced the biggest jump, rising nearly tenfold, Nilson said in its January issue. Worldwide card use almost quadrupled over that period, with the second-biggest increase happening in the Asia-Pacific region, followed by Latin America, Europe and Canada.\n\nAs a result, U.S. card activity as a share of the worldwide use is shrinking. In 2014, U.S. card transactions accounted for about 38.6% of the 195.66 billion payments worldwide, which was the largest share, but by last year it was second-largest with just 20.6% of the much larger 775.96 billion in payments, the Nilson research showed.\n\nThe largest share of card activity last year was in the Asia-Pacific region, which accounted for 45.7% of the worldwide activity, Nilson said. By last year, Europe\u2019s share (19.5%) was the third-largest, nearly equal to that of the U.S.\n\nU.S. bank card issuers, including JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, and their card network partners have blanketed the U.S. market with their cards over the past 70 years and now face rising digital alternative competition. While some digital tools, such as PayPal, may connect to credit or debit cards, others, like Early Warning Services\u2019 Zelle, may bypass cards by connecting directly to consumer bank accounts.\n\nRegulators have sometimes egged on the competition. When the Justice Department sued Visa last year over its debit card practices, it alleged the card network had engaged in illegal antitrust maneuvers to fend off big technology company rivals. The lawsuit is pending, but the pressure of the litigation and its resolution could give a lift to card competitors.",

            "content": "Two weeks ago I had my license revoked by the Metropolitan of the Anglican Catholic Church. I am hoping this will be a final update on the situation and provide some closure on the matter.\n\nClosure\n\nTo this day, I have still not been graced with a phone call or Zoom conversation with Archbishop Mark Haverland, who removed my license and released a lengthy press statement within 45 minutes of receiving a complaint from the woke mob. However, the Archbishop has released more public statements. I made my refutation on X, and as I said at the time, I will be leaving the matter there. Since then, Haverland has leaked personal communications not just between him and me, but also including third parties. I cannot refute those conveniently clipped and out-of-context communiques without implementing innocent third parties, and Haverland knows this. Regardless, I do not want to engage in a constant tit-for-tat or he-said-he-said. Frankly, I find the Archbishop\u2019s approach unedifying for the Church and quite scandalous. I have tried to bite my tongue and not engage in an internet argument with my superiors, preferring to have a proper conversation, but when that is not mutual it is incredibly difficult. People will make of the Archbishop\u2019s stream of statements and leaks what they will. I have found much of it to be half-truths and mistruths in the form of a character assassination, I would hope our shepherds were above that. Haverland\u2019s canon lawyer Wassan has been going further by publishing outright lies, some of which are surely libelous. Wassan has been obsessively posting literally hundreds of comments about me over the past fortnight. Her dislike of me is palpable. For the denomination\u2019s canon lawyer to be taking privileged information and using it to paint a false narrative is highly unprofessional. But that is to be expected in these small cliques. I have no idea how I rattled her particular cage, but I hope she finds peace now that I am gone.\n\nIt has been asked whether I will be appealing Haverland\u2019s decision. I did inquire into the Anglican Catholic Church\u2019s appeals process. Haverland made it clear that the person responsible for hearing my appeal would be his friend Bishop Mead. I have only interacted very briefly with Bp Mead, but I do not trust that this would be a fair and impartial appeal due to the fact that he has already publicly admonished me in the press, giving a disparaging statement agreeing with Archbishop Haverland\u2019s stance. It is safe to say Bp Mead has made his prejudice known. The only other thing I know about Bp Mead is that when I joined the ACC, one of his contemporaries warned me about him. Apparently, Bp Mead was annoyed that I got ordained by the Old Catholics instead of the Anglican Catholic Church in the UK. To be quite frank, it was not clear that the ACC existed in the UK. It seems they have a chapel and perhaps a couple of house churches in the South East, but they are not very present in Anglo-Catholic circles. This should come as no surprise to anyone in the least bit aware of Anglican ecclesiastical polity. There are lots of snobbish men with pointy hats fighting over fiefdoms. If these bishops spent more time disciplining the nation, and less time contesting over already fertile ground, perhaps Christendom would be in a better state today.\n\nSuffice it to say, trust has been broken. I do not trust Haverland or Mead; they do not trust me. Even if I was to file an appeal and it was somehow successful. Say, for example, I ate humble pie and apologised for my silly joke and agreed to give up my public ministry as Haverland seems to want \u2013 I would not trust my Archbishop to have my back if anything ever happened in the future. I am still yet to be contacted by a single safeguarding officer or person responsible for mental well-being in the denomination. Despite receiving thousands of messages of abuse, having the media at my door with cameras, and receiving death threats, there has been zero pastoral support from the higher-ups, nothing but handwashing from the so-called pastor to the pastors. More importantly, there has been very little attention made to ensure my parishioners have regular access to the Sacraments. It has become crystal clear to me that the ACC does not care about me or my parishioners. Our church is a net contributor to the diocese, and as far as I can gather, gets very little out of being a member of the jurisdiction.\n\nA number of godly laymen, priests, and bishops from the ACC have contacted me informally and unofficially, and I appreciate each and every one of them. They know who they are. In fact, one particular bishop asked me to appeal and said I should request that the College of Bishops hear my appeal instead of Bp Mead. This bishop thought I would get a fairer hearing that way. I put this request in to Abp Haverland, but he made it clear that it would be Bp Mead hearing my appeal, although he said Bp Mead could ask the College of Bishops to review his decision if he liked.\n\nGoing forward\n\nWith trust broken down to an irreparable level, I will not be pursuing future ministry in the ACC. Bear in mind that my license was revoked without so much as a conversation, with no formal warnings, reprimands, and no prior disciplinary action.\n\nThe parish that I have been called to remains on my mind, in my heart, and in my prayers. My parishioners are still making their deliberations as to their next move, and working through the processes. Please keep them in your prayers. They are a faithful congregation, and my only regret in all of this is bringing drama to their doorstep. This situation may have exposed the cold uncharitable leadership of the ACC, but the parish does not deserve to go through all this rigamarole. The lesson for me has been to be more fatherly in my public ministry, that is certainly something I can work on, with the right support. When I am speaking at the podium, I need to always have in the back of my mind, \u201chow will this affect my people back home.\u201d Granted, many of them have told me personally that they support my public ministry and, in fact, that I should not apologise for the joke I made at the end of my pro-life speech, but still, I repent of creating a stressful situation for us all. They are a strong bunch, but they should not have to be. It is one of the problems of the delicate balance between public and parish ministry. I have always and will always put my parish first \u2013 this is something people on the outside may not always appreciate. There have been many an exciting event \u2013 including foreign trips, or invitations to Mar-a-Lago \u2013 that I have turned down because the Mass comes first. Everything revolves around the Mass, the source and summit of the Christian faith.\n\nThe parish knows this. My parishioners \u2013 their pastoral needs and the Sacraments \u2013 always take priority. But people outside of the parish see only my public work and often make assumptions. One of the benefits of having a public profile is that I gain more support than I get abuse; but every Joe and Jane Blogs has an opinion on how my ministry should look, from their perspective. Some people think I should focus more on the public ministry, Americans tend to think I should focus there, Britons tend to think I should return to the UK. Some people think I should give up the public ministry and focus entirely on my parish ministry. Protestants think I should be preaching more Low Church theology, Catholics think I should cross the Tiber, and OrthoBros think I should become Orthodox. As humans, we tend to project our own feelings onto others, and I should take it as a compliment that people want to shape me into their own image. But I want to be loyal to God first. We should all want to be shaped in Christ\u2019s image. I try to pray through these decisions and discern His calling on my life. My platform has been gifted to me for His purposes, not my own. And He calls me to the priestly vocation, affirmed by the Church. The two things need not be mutually exclusive, as much as we might like them to be at times. The balance is not something I always get right, but with the right support, there is no reason it cannot be done. I was also called to Michigan, of that I am certain. I could have stayed and fought longer in the UK, but I think perhaps I played my part for the time being, and hope to one day return; I could have gone somewhere really conservative like Florida, Texas, or Alabama, all of which are places I love, and where I have plenty of friends. But God called me to West Michigan, where I have had to start pretty much from scratch. I am not fully sure why, other than to minister to the wonderful people in my parish. I have received the warmest of welcomes, that is for sure. I love the place, even with the sub-zero temperatures and all the lake-effect snow!\n\nRelentless attacks\n\nI believe God is setting something up for us in Grand Rapids. He has a plan, we know that, and I think it is going to be marvelous. And I think that is why the enemy is relentless in his attacks. He does not want us to succeed.\n\nThis week, after being doxxed, abused, hounded by the press, sacked, and smeared by the Archbishop, I have had another battle to fight. My US visa was revoked.\n\nFor context, I am not on a religious visa \u2013 I am on a media visa tied to my public ministry. It seems someone was waiting for me to leave the country. I arrived in Israel to an email saying my US visa had been revoked, giving no reason and saying that I should visit the US Embassy in London.\n\nNow, the question is who at the US Embassy in London revoked my visa and why? It is difficult to speak with anyone directly, and it is even more difficult to get a direct answer out of anyone.\n\nConsidering that my home is now in Michigan, and all my worldly belongings are currently in a shipping container on their way there, I felt quite isolated. What made matters worse was that my ESTA was revoked, too. I assume this is an automatic response to someone\u2019s visa being revoked. But it meant that I could not go home; I could not get back into the country.\n\nMy next consideration was, is it safe to return to London? President Trump made it clear that if the hostages were not returned by Saturday, all hell would break loose in the Middle East. As good as it was to get a picture of the situation on the ground in Israel, I did not particularly want to be caught up in the middle of a foreign war. But the question people were asking me is, if someone \u2013 perhaps a Leftist UK politician \u2013 leant on someone at the US Embassy to revoke my visa, what would stop them from leaning on the police to arrest me the moment I entered the country? They could charge me with some trumped-up charges about \u201chate speech\u201d, or a \u201chate crime\u201d and run roughshod over my human rights, just as they are doing with Tommy Robinson.\n\nAs an aside, it is criminal what they are doing to Tommy. He is a political prisoner. In prison for \u201ccontempt of court\u201d given 18 months, sent to a max security wing, then to solitary confinement, now they are banning him from buying food in the commissary and preventing him from speaking to his loved ones over the phone or having visitors. For what? Releasing a documentary the Establishment did not want aired. Shame on them!\n\nAnd so I had to decide, is it safer to stay in the war-torn Middle East or head back to London and possibly get arrested? It must be said, London is not looking too different from the Middle East, these days. One could get killed by an intolerant Mohammedan in either place. For my thoughts on Israel and the situation in the Middle East, check out my latest episode of Fox & Father and Common Sense Crusade.\n\nI reached out to a few contacts for support, to get a better picture of what was going on. We discovered a few interesting tidbits. The Visa Coordination Unit is responsible for revoking vias. However, there exists another unit called the Revocation and Coordination Division. \u201cTheir remit is to be alert to any negative information about visa holders that was not known at the time of the application. They can both dig in any visa holder\u2019s past and monitor the present. If something they don\u2019t like comes to their attention, they simply revoke the visa and the right to visit the US altogether without any explanation. Judging by how many institutions refocused from homeland security to conservative witch-hunt, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if this office followed suit. Most people don\u2019t know this office exists.\u201d How many other conservatives does this happen to? Losing access to your home/belongings/life without a moment\u2019s notice? Those without contacts and/or a platform? We might never know unless this department is looked into by DOGE.\n\nIn the end, I decided to return to London so that I could at least be around friends and family whilst I tried to appeal for the restoration of my visa. Who knew how long it would take? Could be months for all I knew, especially considering the US Embassy in London is still full of Biden\u2019s people. President Trump has not selected a replacement, yet. To be fair to him, he has had other priorities.\n\nThankfully, I got my visa restored. God is good, and He still has plans for me in the US. I heard from a number of people who were handling my case throughout the week, and was given two different reasons for the revocation:\n\n1) Someone high up in the ACC reported that I was no longer working there and therefore did not need my visa any longer.\n\n2) One of the visa agents noticed in the media that I had been fired and assumed I no longer needed my visa.\n\nWe may never know the real reason. Or perhaps it was a combination of the two. Going by the vitriolic output from the Archbishop and his attack dog canon lawyer, I would not put it past them to try to disrupt my life after having disrupted my ministry. But I could also see how an agent may be monitoring online activity and not knowing what it means to lose one\u2019s license to administer the Sacraments might have been confused, although, in that case, a conversation might have helped, and this is something the agents I spoke to were confused about. Or maybe it was a leftist/Democrat bureaucrat looking to take some scalps, who knows?\n\nBlessings\n\nWhen we are persecuted for the sake of the truth, we are blessed because of it. The Lord told us that we would be hated for following Him, but to remember that it is He who was hated before us.\n\nEvery worldly and demonic attack ensures we are storing up treasure in heaven. Thank God for my recent persecutions. Although, I would not mind a break from it all for a while, in your great and charitable mercy, Lord.\n\nAfter being canceled by The Church of England, Royal Academy of Dance, The Conservative Party, GB News, Mere Anglicanism, and Anglican Catholic Church, losing my church and potentially my home is jarring. But we soldier on.\n\nThe Reverend Brett Murphy is one of the remaining soldiers for Christ in the United Kingdom, and the good man has teamed up with my dear friend Laurence Fox to launch a crowdfund for me. They are asking people who want to support me, to do so there, so that they can help me gain a bit of security.\n\nWeak and liberal bishops apply pressure on priests to remain silent, and they can do so because they know that they can strip not only our ministry but also our housing away from us at a moment\u2019s notice. Priests get paid very little because it is a life of service, but that means we are stuck in a sense of indentured servitude to sometimes corrupt bishops. If I were to have a base of my own, I would be able to continue with my public ministry regardless, safe in the knowledge that even though they may apply pressure, they could not make me homeless again.\n\nRev\u2019d Brett Murphy knows what this is like. He had a crooked bishop who tried to literally force him out of his church and his home with a police escort, all for being a faithful vicar. Thankfully, his congregation \u2013 both online and in person \u2013 came to his aid and acquired him an abode. He is now stronger than ever.\n\nI wish some of our shepherds would stop trying to pull down people like me and Rev\u2019d Brett Murphy. Instead of trying to cancel us, perhaps they could lead by example. I would not need to be fired for ending a solid pro-life speech with a silly joke if the bishops were out there on those platforms in the first place. Lead the way, shepherds, please. Take the microphone, speak truth to the world, proclaim the Gospel, defend the innocent, protect the vulnerable and the unborn. There are a few good ones out there doing this very thing, but unfortunately, they remain in the minority. The world is tired of elitist bishops in fancy garments sitting on their thrones watching the world crumble around them. Wokeness and liberalism on one side, Islam on the other, the West is sinking into a paradox of degeneracy and intolerance, and the metropolitan liberal elite types would have us sit silently in our pews, instead of advancing the Kingdom. Shame on them, I say.\n\nAs a prime example, this week we heard that 70 Christians were beheaded in the Congo by Mohammedans. The legacy media is not covering the story because it disrupts their narrative about the religion of peace, and there is no love lost for Christianity. But where are the bishops on this? The UK bishops are quick to comment on the government\u2019s Rwanda policy. The US bishops are quick to sue their government for halting USAID money which was being used for people trafficking. We knew where all the bishops stood on Brexit, Covid jabs, and the Ukraine. But when it comes to Christians being persecuted, the silence is deafening. May light perpetually shine upon these martyrs.\n\nPray for our bishops. Pray for our clergy. And pray for persecuted Christians around the world.\n\nI will continue to speak the truth; I will always fight the good fight for the faith, no matter the consequences.\n\nThank you to everyone who has supported me, in the comments or in prayer. An old adversary approached me at ARC this week and asked how I was, and I was really struck by the genuine charity and compassion of someone who has diametrically opposing views to mine. They said, it is okay when Elon Musk and co make bold statements, they have a lot to fall back on, and they are un-cancellable. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d this person asked. And I am because of you all.\n\nThe cost is different for each of us, and I appreciate not everyone is in a position to stick their head above the parapets. Thank you to Rev\u2019d Brett and Laurence for trying to make me un-cancellable, and thank you to everyone who has supported me via the crowdfund set up by Rev\u2019d Brett and Laurence.\n\nGod bless you.",

Nagano struck a first-time volley, but didn\u2019t catch all of it. The ball bounced to center forward Mina Tanaka, who was posting up an Aussie defender with her back to goal and deftly flicked the ball through her own legs with the inside of her right foot, rolling it into the lower left corner to give the Nadeshiko an early lead.\n\nIn the 26th minute, Tanaka sent a looping header off the right side of the crossbar from seven yards out, and would then get her brace six minutes later.\n\nJapan doubled its lead in the 32nd minute as left back Hikaru Kitagawa bent in a cross from deep on the left wing. Australia center back Alanna Kennedy got slightly tangled with fellow center back Claire Hunt and was unable to deal with the service that flew over her head and into the path of Tanaka, who slid to knock the ball past onrushing Australia goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold from seven yards out. It was Tanaka\u2019s 41st international goal, and moved her into sole possession of fourth place on Japan\u2019s all-time scoring list.\n\nJapan effectively put the game away in the 52nd minute on a fantastic team goal. Japan worked the ball through the Australia defense down the left side as it went in quick succession from Fujino to team captain Yui Hasegawa to Tanaka deep inside the penalty area. She played a simple pass across the six-yard box to forward Maika Hamano, who tapped the ball home from close range.\n\nJapan added a fourth in the 75th minute on a brilliantly redirected header goal from center back Moeka Minami, who rose high over the Matildas defense to score into the left corner off a cross from the right by Kitagawa.\n\nJapan held the Aussies to one shot throughout the entire game and zero on goal. Japan outshot Australia 7-0 in the first half and 18-1 overall for the match.\n\nIt was Japan\u2019s largest margin of victory ever in the SheBelieves Cup and was tied for the third-most goals ever scored in an SBC match. It also put Japan in the driver\u2019s seat for the SheBelieves Cup title with a plus-four goal difference heading into the second round of games.\n\nThe teams will now travel to Glendale, Arizona for second doubleheader of the tournament on Jan. 23 as Australia takes on the USA at 3 p.m. MT (TBS, Max, in Spanish on Universo and Peacock and on the radio via the Westwood One Sports Network) and Japan faces Colombia at Noon MT (Max, Universo and Peacock).\n\n- 2025 SHEBELIEVES CUP MATCH REPORT -\n\nMatch: Japan Women\u2019s National Team vs. Australia Women\u2019s National Team\n\nDate: February 20, 2025\n\nCompetition: 2025 SheBelieves Cup\n\nVenue: Shell Energy Stadium; Houston, Texas\n\nAttendance: 5,243\n\nKickoff: 4:03 p.m. local (5:03 p.m. ET)\n\nWeather: 39 degrees, sunny\n\nScoring Summary 1 2 F JPN 2 2 4 AUS 0 0 0 JPN \u2013 Mina Tanaka (Fuka Nagano) 6th minute JPN \u2013 Mina Tanaka (Hikaru Kitagawa) 32 JPN \u2013 Maika Hamano (Mina Tanaka) 52 JPN \u2013 Moeka Minami (Hikaru Kitagawa) 75\n\nLineups:\n\nJPN: 1-Ayaka Yamashita; 5-Hana Takahashi (21-Miyabi Moriya, 85), 6-Toko Koga, 3-Moeka Minami, 13-Hikaru Kitagawa; 17-Maika Hamano (8-Manaka Matsukubo, 71), 4-Saki Kumagai, 14-Yui Hasegawa, 15-Aoba Fujino (9-Riko Ueki, 60); 10-Fuka Nagano (7-Hinata Miyazawa, 60), 11-Mina Tanaka (22-Yuka Momiki, 85)\n\nSubstitutions Not Used: 2-Saori Takarada, 12-Chika Hirao, 16-Momoko Tanikawa, 18-Honoka Hayashi, 19-Remina Chiba, 20-Narumi Miura, 23-Akane Okuma\n\nHead coach: Nils Nielsen\n\nAUS: 1-Mackenzie Arnold; 21-Ellie Carpenter, 14-Alanna Kennedy (3-Winonah Heatley, 64), 4-Clare Hunt, 7-Steph Catley (22-Charlotte Grant, 64); 19-Katrina Gorry (10-Emily van Egmond, 74), 23-Kyra Cooney-Cross (5-Natasha Prior, 85); 16-Hayley Raso, 11-Mary Fowler (15-Daniela Galic, 64), 13-Tameka Yallop; 9-Caitlin Foord (17-Holly McNamara, 64)\n\nSubstitutions Not Used: 2-Michelle Heyman, 6-Alana Murphy, 8-Kaitlyn Torpey, 12-Teagan Micah, 18-Chloe Lincoln 20-Laini Freier\n\nHead coach: Tom Sermanni\n\nStats Summary: JPN / AUS\n\nShots: 18 / 1\n\nShots on Goal: 8 / 0\n\nSaves: 0 / 4\n\nCorner Kicks: 7 / 2\n\nFouls: 18 / 7\n\nOffside: 1 / 1\n\nMisconduct Summary:\n\nNone\n\nOfficials:\n\nReferee: Natalie Simon (USA)\n\nAssistant Referee 1: Tiffini Turpin (USA)\n\nAssistant Referee 2: Jennifer Garner (USA)\n\n4th Official: Danielle Chesky (USA)",

            "content": "The U.S. Department of State has announced updated guidance restricting eligibility for nonimmigrant visa interview waivers at U.S. Consulates. Under the revised guidance, nonimmigrant visa applicants may be eligible for an interview waiver if they previously held a visa in the same category and their prior visa expired within the last 12 months or is still valid, among other eligibility requirements. The guidance also provides that individuals applying for visas in certain diplomatic or official government organization visa classifications may be eligible for visa interview waivers. Visa applicants who do not meet the revised narrower criteria will be required to attend an in-person interview at a U.S. Consulate to apply for their visa.\n\nPrior Policy and What Has Changed\n\nPreviously, nonimmigrant visa applicants were eligible for an interview waiver and drop box processing if they held an approved nonimmigrant visa in any category that had expired within the last 48 months. This prior guidance was introduced following the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce consular visa application backlogs and streamline visa application processing.\n\nUnder the updated criteria, nonimmigrant visa applicants may be eligible to renew their visas without a visa interview if they meet the following criteria:\n\nApply in their country of nationality or residence;\n\nHave never been refused a visa (unless such refusal was overcome or waived); and\n\nHave no apparent or potential ineligibility.\n\nThe guidance also indicates that consular officers may still require in-person interviews on a case-by-case basis or because of local conditions.\n\nThe more restrictive criteria for visa interview waivers are consistent with the directive of \u201cmaximum vetting\u201d as announced in the Administration\u2019s Executive Order of January 20, 2025.\n\nImpact on Nonimmigrant Visa Holders\n\nThis change will likely increase the wait times for in-person visa appointments at U.S. Consulates worldwide.\n\nThe Department of State has not confirmed yet how consular posts will treat interview waiver eligibility for drop box appointments that have already been scheduled, or interview waiver visa applications that are currently pending adjudication. There have been reports that some applicants with scheduled interview waiver appointments who do not meet the updated criteria have been turned away and told to schedule in-person interview appointments instead.\n\nIndividuals who have already made a consular appointment under the interview waiver program and whose prior visa was in a different category or expired more than 12 months ago, may be required to schedule an in-person interview.\n\nPrior to travel, individuals that require a new visa stamp to return to the U.S. should carefully review U.S. Consulate websites for more detailed information about visa application requirements and procedures, and the specific U.S. Consulate\u2019s operating status and services.\n\nGibney is closely monitoring these developments and will provide additional updates as they are announced.\n\n[View source.]",

Consular officers now have the authority to exempt certain applicants from in-person interviews under section 222(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.The updated policy applies to applicants under specific visa classifications, including:To qualify for an interview waiver, applicants must:Despite these waivers, consular officers retain the discretion to request in-person interviews on a case-by-case basis or due to local conditions. The Department of State advises applicants to check the respective U.S. embassy or consulate websites for specific application guidelines and operational updates.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)This update replaces the previous interview waiver policy announced on December 21, 2023, the US State Department said in a statement.The United States recently revised the eligibility criteria for its Visa Interview Waiver, commonly known as the \u2018dropbox\u2019 facility, significantly reducing the renewal window. Effective immediately, only applicants renewing a visa in the same nonimmigrant category that expired within the last 12 months can use the dropbox option. This marks a sharp reduction from the previous 48-month eligibility period.The change affects nonimmigrant visa holders, including H-1B and B1/B2 applicants, who previously benefited from the extended renewal window introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. While no formal announcement has been made, Visa Application Centers (VACs) have begun enforcing the new rule, turning away applicants who do not meet the revised criteria.Previously, individuals with visas that expired within the past 48 months could renew them through the dropbox process. This policy, implemented in 2022, aimed to reduce wait times at US embassies and consulates. The return to the pre-pandemic 12-month rule means that those whose prior visas expired more than a year ago must now undergo an in-person interview.",

Those wishing to renew their visas that expired more than 12 months ago will be required to attend in-person interviews, which could add substantial time and cost to the visa renewal process.\n\nThe Dropbox Program (also known as the Interview Waiver Program) was implemented to streamline the visa renewal process for applicants who meet the qualifications, allowing them to avoid in-person interviews at U.S. consulates abroad. In December 2020, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoS extended the period for eligibility from those with visas expiring fewer than 12 months ago to fewer than 48 months. The DoS has now reverted to the pre-pandemic period of 12 months.\n\nThis change was made without any notice, creating significant logistical issues for those who were planning to use the Dropbox Program, as well as their employers. Consular appointments will be even harder to come by, particularly in countries like India, where there is already extremely high demand. One avenue of relief would be domestic visa revalidation, which the DoS piloted in 2024 (domestic visa renewal pilot program). Unfortunately, the DoS has not given any indication as to whether the program will become permanent.\n\nAs a result of this new limitation, we strongly encourage clients to coordinate with their foreign national employees (especially Indian nationals) to renew their visas before the end of the 12-month period described above. By doing so, they will avoid the challenges and costs associated with finding and attending a visa appointment at a U.S. consulate abroad.",

            "content": "Here's an in-depth look at two longtime Berkshire Hathaway-held stocks.\n\nWarren Buffett is often hailed as one of the greatest investors of all time, having delivered exceptional returns for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) over many decades. Under his leadership since 1965, the company's stock has achieved an impressive compound annual growth rate of 19.8% through 2023, nearly doubling the S&P 500, which saw a 10.2% return, including dividends.\n\nGiven Buffett's track record of market-beating success, it's worth examining Berkshire's $300 billion stock portfolio to identify potential investments that could help you surpass market performance. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at two of Berkshire's longest-held positions, American Express (AXP 3.59%) and Visa (V 0.99%), and explore which might be the better buy for investors today.\n\nHere's when Berkshire invested in American Express and Visa\n\nBerkshire Hathaway began building its initial $1.3 billion position in American Express in 1991, continuing its purchases through 1995. That investment in what was then a bank holding and payments company has since grown to $46.3 billion. Over time, Berkshire has increased its stake in American Express from nearly 10% to 21.6% -- without purchasing additional shares or reinvesting dividends.\n\nWarren Buffett highlighted his long-term commitment to American Express (and Coca-Cola) in his 2023 letter to shareholders: \"When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.\"\n\nBy contrast, Berkshire's investment in Visa began much later, in 2011, three years after the payments giant went public. Unlike its American Express holdings, Berkshire has traded its Visa position, making six additional purchases and three sales since its initial investment. Today, Berkshire owns 8.3 million Visa shares, worth approximately $2.9 billion, representing about 1% of its stock portfolio.\n\nWhile the Visa investment wasn't originally Buffett's idea -- it was initiated by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler -- he has since acknowledged its merits. Reflecting on Visa and (and competitor Mastercard), Buffett admitted in 2018: \"I could have bought them as well, and looking back, I should have.\"\n\nA look at American Express' and Visa's recent financials\n\nBefore analyzing each company's recent financial results, it's important to understand a key difference between the two: American Express operates as a closed-loop network, whereas Visa functions as an open-loop network. The main distinction is that American Express issues credit and processes its own transactions, while Visa relies on major financial institutions to support and issue its cards, benefiting from transaction volume.\n\nAs a result, American Express, with a market capitalization of $218 billion, generates significantly more revenue but less profit than Visa, with a market capitalization of $685 billion.\n\nLooking at each company's December 2024 quarterly results, American Express generated $17.2 billion in net revenue and $2.2 billion in net income, representing year-over-year growth of 9% and 12%, respectively. Conversely, Visa reported $9.5 billion in net revenue and $5.1 billion in net income for the fiscal first quarter, equating to year-over-year growth of 10% and 5%, respectively.\n\nThese results illustrate that while American Express is growing its net income faster, Visa is more efficient in converting revenue into profit. This efficiency is evident in Visa's industry-leading operating margin of 66%, compared to American Express' 21.2%. Still, American Express' higher net income growth gives it the slightest edge in this category.\n\nBoth companies are shareholder-friendly\n\nAmerican Express and Visa adopt similar approaches to capital allocation. They consistently enhance shareholder value by raising dividends and executing stock buybacks. Dividends provide investors with a steady income, while share repurchases increase individual ownership stakes by reducing the number of outstanding shares.\n\nOn the topic of dividends, American Express has paid a quarterly dividend since 1989, with frequent raises since. Today, the company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share, equating to an annual yield of 1.1%. Additionally, management recently stated its intentions to increase its quarterly dividend by 17% in 2025.\n\nComparatively, Visa has paid and raised its quarterly dividend for 16 consecutive years, with its last raise coming in at 13%. Today, Visa pays a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, which equates to an annual yield of 0.7%.\n\nWhen it comes to share repurchases, American Express spent $5.9 billion on share repurchases in 2024, and the board is authorized to repurchase roughly 75 million shares of its 702 million outstanding shares or nearly 11%.\n\nVisa has been even more aggressive with share repurchases, spending $17.1 billion over the past 12 months and reducing its outstanding shares by 9.2% over the last three years. As of Dec. 31, 2024, Visa had $9.1 billion still authorized for buybacks, so the company will likely continue this approach.\n\nWhile both American Express and Visa have demonstrated strong capital allocation strategies, Visa stands out in this category for its consistent dividend growth and larger scale of share repurchases.\n\nIs American Express or Visa the better buy today?\n\nFor the final category, let's briefly examine valuation using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- which compares a company's market price to its trailing 12 months of earnings per share (EPS) -- and growth prospects as the tiebreaker.\n\nAs of this writing, American Express and Visa traded at P/E ratios of 36 and 22, respectively. Given Visa's historically higher earnings, it has typically carried a higher P/E ratio, with a five-year median of 32 compared to American Express' 18.\n\nBoth stocks trade above their five-year median, likely due to recent guidance. American Express expects 8% to 10% revenue growth and 12% to 16% adjusted EPS growth for 2025, while Visa projects \"low double-digit\" revenue and \"low teens\" adjusted EPS growth for its fiscal 2025.\n\nAll in all, American Express and Visa are worth owning in any portfolio, considering both companies are entrenched in the global economy and offer promising growth opportunities. Choosing between them is splitting hairs, but American Express gets a slight edge for its better valuation and higher EPS growth prospects.",

            "content": "Recent U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) rules aim to strengthen protections for H-2A agricultural workers, addressing vulnerabilities like retaliation and employer accountability. While the reforms mark progress, they already face scrutiny and legal challenges.\n\nThe Trump-Vance administration\u2019s arrival adds uncertainty to the H-2A program. President Trump has promised the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, raising concerns among farmer lobby groups, immigration advocates, and business experts. The administration may ultimately need to expand the H-2A visa program to fill employment gaps.\n\nH-2A workers play a vital role in agriculture but remain vulnerable to workplace abuses, according to DOL. Seeking to promote employer accountability, DOL recently amended the H-2A program in its Final Rule. According to Former Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Sue, the changes aim to ensure workers \u201care treated fairly, have a voice in their workplace, and are able to perform their work safely.\u201d\n\nThe Final Rule expands anti-retaliation protections, clarifies termination conditions, and allows workers to receive guests, like lawyers, at employer-provided housing. It also prohibits employers from withholding identification documents and mandates seatbelts in employer-provided transportation.\n\nThe H-2A program allows U.S. agricultural employers to hire foreign workers temporarily or seasonally when there are insufficient qualified and available U.S. workers, provided it does not negatively affect domestic wages.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 48,000 H-2A workers were certified by DOL in 2005. By 2023, that number exceeded 378,000.\n\nEach spring, about 1,500 H-2A workers arrive on Virginia\u2019s Eastern Shore to plant and harvest labor-intensive crops, Stacy Rhodes of the Agricultural Workers Advocacy Coalition (AWAC), tells Food Tank. H-2A workers are \u201cabsolutely critical to the agricultural economy here,\u201d Rhodes says.\n\nAWAC commended DOL for scrutinizing the program. The Alliance to End Human Trafficking applauded DOL\u2019s efforts \u201cto protect the basic human rights of H-2A workers.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Final Rule has drawn criticism for prioritizing minor changes while overlooking systemic issues like transportation access and worker isolation.\n\nWhile the seatbelt requirement may reduce accidents, most H-2A workers lack access to vehicles altogether, says Maggie Gray, Adelphi University Professor and Author of Labor and the Locavore: The Making of a Comprehensive Food Ethic. According to AWAC, employers rarely provide transportation, even for medical emergencies.\n\nH-2A workers often live in remote labor camps with limited digital connectivity, isolating them throughout employment, Rhodes tells Food Tank. This seclusion makes reporting abuses difficult, and fear of retaliation deters self-advocacy. Gray notes that workers risk losing employment, immigration status, or future job opportunities if they assert their rights.\n\nAlthough the Final Rule seeks to strengthen worker protections, enforcement remains a challenge. The rules \u201care only as good as the implementation,\u201d Gray tells Food Tank.\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute (EPI) reports that DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD), tasked with federal enforcement, is \u201cunderfunded and understaffed,\u201d with 800 WHD investigators monitoring 165 million workers. The U.S. Department of State describes oversight of temporary worker programs as \u201cweak,\u201d while EPI calls it \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201d\n\nThe Final Rule also faces legal challenges. The American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued DOL, alleging regulatory overreach and unconstitutional restrictions on employer speech.\n\nThe Southeastern Legal Foundation, representing states and farmer groups, argued that the Rule unlawfully grants temporary foreign workers more rights than domestic workers. The Workers and Farmer Labor Association also filed suit, calling the changes an \u201caudit nightmare\u201d filled with \u201cgrenades and traps.\u201d\n\nFederal courts have blocked enforcement in 21 states and against multiple employers, issuing a nationwide stay on certain provisions while legal proceedings continue. The Rule otherwise remains in effect.\n\nAmid legislative changes and court challenges, the Trump administration adds uncertainty to the H-2A program. President Trump has promised the \u201clargest deportation\u201d in U.S. history and signed executive orders with broad immigration implications.\n\nDavid Ortega, Professor of Food Economics at Michigan State University, warns that deportations could \u201cshock the food supply chain.\u201d At least 70 percent of U.S. crop harvesters are foreign-born, according to DOL, and nearly half of the nation\u2019s approximately 2 million farm workers lack legal status.\n\nU.S. workers are unlikely to fill the gap. According to DOL, Americans accept only 5 percent of H-2A job offers, and many of those hired fail to report to work or resign. Immigrant farm workers perform \u201ccritical roles that many U.S.-born workers are either unable or unwilling to take on,\u201d Ortega says.\n\nTo address labor shortages, the Trump-Vance administration may expand the H-2 visa program. Agricultural lobbying groups including International Fresh Produce Association have urged Trump to consider expansion, and Trump Senior Advisor Jason Miller discussed the possibility.\n\nMeanwhile, newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins pledged to implement Trump\u2019s agenda while supporting farmers and ranchers. Responding to Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL)\u2019s questions about deportation and labor, Rollins expressed interest in \u201creforming and perhaps modernizing the H-2A program.\u201d\n\nArticles like the one you just read are made possible through the generosity of Food Tank members.

            "content": "The temporary UK visas worrying Ukrainian refugees\n\n20 February 2025 Share Save Helen Mulroy BBC News, Buckinghamshire Share Save\n\nBBC Viktoria Shtanko founded the charity Ukraine Appeal which helped those who arrived in Milton Keynes after fleeing Ukraine\n\nA charity is calling on the government to rethink the visas it offers Ukrainians living in the UK and include a permanent route to settlement. Many Ukrainian nationals, who moved to the UK after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, will soon have to apply to extend their visa via the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme (UPE). While it offered an 18-month extension, it does not offer any permanent option to remain. The Home Office said the \"offer of sanctuary is in line with the Ukrainian government's strong desire for the future return of its citizens, and other routes are available for those wishing to settle permanently in the UK\".\n\nUkraine Appeal, which supports migrants in Buckinghamshire, said it was \"very very difficult\" for those who have fled war to deal with uncertainty surrounding their future. Viktoriya Shtanko, who has lived in Milton Keynes since 2008, set up the charity to help fellow Ukrainians arriving in the area. She believed Ukrainians who wanted to, should be allowed to remain in Britain long-term to help grow the economy. \"No-one expected the war would go for so long,\" she said. \"Now as the children are settled, and as adults are in work trying to contribute to society... they are the people who Britain needs.\"\n\nValeriia Pavliuk and Iryna Maracine want the government to provide a route to permanent settlement in the UK\n\nIryna Maracine and Valeriia Pavliuk were just two of the women the charity has supported. Ms Maracine, 38, works as a carer in a care home in Milton Keynes. Her hometown of Lysychansk, in eastern Ukraine, was under occupation by the Russian army. She told the BBC: \"Everything is destroyed. A lot of buildings are burned, it's absolutely heartbreaking.\" She said she had no home to return to and wanted certainty for her two sons, aged 12 and 16, who were settled in school here. \"I'm worried about my future,\" she added. \"We are very appreciative of what we have and this chance to stay safe, but my kids - they ask me all the time, 'Mum, what is our future?' and I don't have an answer for them.\"\n\nUkraine Appeal Iryna Maracine left Lysychansk with her two sons and found safe haven in Milton Keynes\n\nMs Pavliuk, 26, works as an administrator. She believes her employment opportunities have been limited because of the temporary nature of the UK's visa scheme. She said some employers were reluctant to hire Ukrainians because they \"see this temporary visa and see uncertainty with this person\".\n\nUkraine Appeal has been in contact with the MP for Milton Keynes, Emily Darlington. Darlington told the BBC that when she recently spoke to the Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, he assured her that the visa schemes currently in place would remain in place until the end of the war. She acknowledged that some Ukrainians who have built businesses may want to stay beyond the conclusion of the war and said she \"would welcome that\". However, she stated she could not offer any guarantees that a permanent route to settlement would be offered. \"I know some will want to stay - now that happened during the Bosnian war and the UK government successfully made sure that they could,\" Darlington said. \"So for the few that do want to stay, the discussions will happen post the war.\"",

EB-1 India: Final Action Dates will maintain a filing cutoff date of February 1, 2022.\n\n\n\nEB-2, Second Preference Category\n\nEB-2 Worldwide (including El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, Mexico, and Philippines) will advance by six weeks to May 15, 2023.\n\nChina: Final Action Dates will advance by two weeks to May 8, 2020.\n\nIndia: Final Action dates will advance by six weeks to December 1, 2012.\n\nEB-3, Third Preference Category (Professional and Skilled Workers)\n\nEB-3 Worldwide (including El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, Mexico and Philippines) will maintain a filing cut-off date of December 1, 2022.\n\nChina: Final Action Dates will advance by one month to August 1, 2020.\n\nIndia: Final Action Dates will advance by six weeks to February 1, 2013.\n\nEB-3 Other Workers\n\nOther Workers (including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico) will advance by approximately two months to February 1, 2021.\n\nPhilippines will advance by five weeks to January 15, 2021.\n\nChina will maintain a filing cut-off date of January 1, 2017.\n\nIndia will advance by six weeks to February 1, 2013.\n\nEB-5: Fifth Preference Category (Immigrant Investors)\n\nEB-5 Final Action Dates across all employment-based categories will hold steady from last month: For the EB-5 Unreserved categories (C5, T5, I5, and R5), India will remain unchanged at January 1, 2022 and China will maintain a cut-off date of July 15, 2016. All other countries will remain current. The EB-5 \u201cSet-Aside\u201d categories (Rural, High Unemployment, and Infrastructure) will remain current.\n\n\n\nIndividuals with a priority date that is before the published cut-off date may file an Adjustment of Status application based on the dates outlined above.\n\nWHAT SHOULD EMPLOYERS EXPECT?\n\nAs noted in the March Visa Bulletin, modest advancement is observed under Final Action Dates for EB-2 and EB-3 China and India, as well as for EB-2 Worldwide and EB-3 Other Workers by approximately two weeks to two months, depending on the employment-based category and country.\n\nDue to continued high demand for green cards across all employment-based categories, moderate advancement in the visa bulletin is likely to continue in the coming months to ensure efficient visa allocation. As a result, Employers should work closely with immigration counsel to promptly file eligible Adjustment of Status applications, as ongoing backlogs and strong demand are expected to further extend the green card process for many foreign nationals.\n\n[View source.]",

            "content": "The U.S. Department of State appears to be restricting interview waiver eligibility for H-1B and other temporary workers at U.S. consulates around the world.\n\nAccording to various consular websites, the State Department is rolling back visa interview waiver program eligibility criteria that have been in place since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nApplicants in temporary worker visa categories are eligible for an interview waiver at participating posts if they are renewing a visa in the same category and if their prior visa expired within the last 12 months or is still valid. Since 2021, those with a visa in the same classification that had expired within the preceding 48 months could qualify for an interview waiver.\n\n\u201cWhile no official government announcement has been made, visa application centers are reportedly turning away applicants who do not meet the updated eligibility requirements,\u201d said Jessica Lang, an attorney in the Boston office of Jackson Lewis. \u201cThis change could have significant implications for H-1B, L-1, O-1, and other visa holders who previously relied on the drop box processing for visa renewals.\u201d\n\nLang explained that eligible applicants could simply use the consulate\u2019s drop box to submit biometrics and drop off documents for processing. The expanded eligibility window was introduced during the pandemic to help reduce consular backlogs and was expected to remain in place indefinitely, she said.\n\n\u201cNow, it appears that only those whose prior visas in the same category that expired within the past 12 months remain eligible for drop box processing,\u201d she said. \u201cApplicants who do not meet this requirement must reschedule for an in-person visa interview or risk being turned away or face processing delays.\u201d\n\nMany visa categories require that an applicant attend an interview before they can receive a visa approval. For those applying within the U.S., the interview will typically take place at a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field office. For those applying from outside the U.S., the interview appointment will be conducted at a U.S. Embassy or consulate.\n\nThe purpose of an interview for a work-related visa is to assess the applicant\u2019s eligibility for the specific visa category for which they have applied.\n\nLang said that restricting interview waiver eligibility will increase demand for in-person interview appointments at U.S. embassies and consulates, leading to longer wait times, particularly in high-volume locations.\n\n\u201cConfirm your eligibility before your scheduled appointment,\u201d she said. \u201cIf your prior visa expired more than 12 months ago or you are applying for a visa in a different category, you may need to reschedule for an in-person interview. Plan for potential delays. Consular wait times are already lengthy, and this policy change may create additional backlogs.\u201d\n\nJoin SHRM and immigration and employment law experts for a timely webinar to be better equipped to proactively manage and support your workforce amid evolving immigration policies.",

            "content": "ASTANA \u2014 The Kazakh Foreign Ministry hosted a briefing on Feb. 18 to explain three new visa categories targeting skilled professionals, entrepreneurs and remote workers seeking long-term opportunities, whether for career growth or business expansion.\n\nThese visas include the Neo Nomad Visa (B12-1), Digital Nomad Visa (B9-1), and Permanent Residence Visa (B9).\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Roman Vassilenko led the briefing alongside Deputy Minister of Tourism and Sports Yerzhan Yerkinbayev and Deputy Chairman of the Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Development Committee of the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation, and Aerospace Industry Miras Zakiyev.\n\n\u201cFor nomads, movement was not just a necessity but a way of life. Today, in an era defined by digital transformation and global networks, mobility extends beyond physical borders. The modern nomad of the 21st century is not just a traveler but also an innovator, entrepreneur, and creator. And Kazakhstan is ready to welcome them warmly,\u201d said Vassilenko in his opening remarks.\n\nHe stressed Kazakhstan believes that \u201cmobility fuels innovation, and diversity drives progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we are implementing smart visa solutions, open skies policies, and investment-friendly frameworks\u2014positioning Kazakhstan as both a destination and a gateway to new opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMobility today is about more than passports and stamps\u2014it is about how people live and work in a hyper-connected world. That is why we have recently introduced these new visa categories,\u201d added Vassilenko.\n\nNew visa categories\n\nThe Neo Nomad Visa is designed for professionals and digital entrepreneurs who want to live in Kazakhstan while working remotely with foreign income. It is a multiple-entry visa valid for up to one year, extendable for another year. Family members can also obtain visas for the same duration, though work and religious activities are restricted.\n\nTo qualify, applicants must show a stable monthly income of at least $3,000, verified through bank statements and tax declarations. They also need an invitation from a Kazakh host, except for citizens of 48 economically developed countries. Other requirements include a certificate of no criminal record and valid health insurance.\n\nThe Digital Nomad Visa is intended for IT professionals relocating to Kazakhstan for permanent residence. It offers a single-entry electronic visa valid for one year and a multiple-entry paper visa that can be obtained through the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Applicants must secure a petition from Astana Hub or an authorized IT sector body.\n\nThe Visa for Permanent Residence provides a pathway for professionals in high-demand fields such as medicine, science, innovation, education, and the creative industries. It includes a single-entry visa valid for 90 days and a multiple-entry visa issued once per year. Once in Kazakhstan, professionals can transition to permanent residency and integrate into the job market.\n\nGetaway for digital nomads\n\n\u201cKazakhstan continues to strengthen its position as an open and accessible destination for international visitors. This commitment to openness has become a key factor in the growth of tourism. In 2024, 15.3 million people visited Kazakhstan, which is 66% more than in the previous year,\u201d said Yerkinbayev, noting the timeliness and relevance of the new visas.\n\n\u201cOur target audience consists of financially independent individuals, entrepreneurs, remote employees, and freelancers looking for a long-term stay and the chance to explore Kazakhstan,\u201d he added.\n\nOne of the first recipients of the Neo Nomad Visa is Sertac Yener, an expert in finance and energy project development. While working on a clean energy project in the United States, he plans to explore and work in Kazakhstan.\n\nSince its launch, the visa has been granted to seven digital nomads from the U.S., the United Kingdom, Singapore, South Korea and Latvia.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Astana Times, Yerkinbayev said Kazakhstan can become a favorite place among digital nomads.\n\n\u201cThis program is a significant step towards supporting Kazakhstan\u2019s digital economy and attracting highly qualified foreign specialists. By implementing this program, Kazakhstan fosters innovation and startup development, strengthening its status as a technology hub on the international stage,\u201d said Zakiyev.\n\nDuring a Q&A session, diplomats, consular representatives, and media attendees engaged with officials on visa policies. Estonia\u2019s Consul Maija Tasa expressed enthusiasm, comparing Kazakhstan\u2019s initiative to Estonia\u2019s digital nomad visa program.\n\n\u201cKazakhstan is expanding possibilities for professionals and digital workers. We have had a similar program in Estonia for years and have cooperated closely with Kazakhstan,\u201d Tasa told The Astana Times.\n\nA vision for openness and connectivity\n\nKazakhstan has positioned itself as a gateway for global opportunities by promoting mobility and diversity as key drivers of progress. The country currently offers visa-free entry to citizens of more than 80 countries and has an electronic visa system for 109 countries.\n\n\u201cAnd we do not intend to stop there,\u201d said Vassilenko.\n\nUnder its open skies policy, which extends until 2027, Kazakhstan operates more than 700 international flights per week to over 30 countries. It removes restrictions on flight frequency to attract more carriers and improve global connectivity.\n\nKazakhstan is also expanding its digital infrastructure, advancing smart cities and increasing high-speed internet access to foster a technology-driven environment. Vassilenko highlighted the country\u2019s integrated e-government system, which allows users to complete transactions such as real estate sales, loan applications and marriage registrations online.\n\n\u201cKazakhstan has always been a land of nomads \u2013 bold, forward-looking, and open to the world. As you reflect on this, please take a moment to explore the fresh from the press brochure on the table titled, Kazakhstan \u2013 Born Bold. The brochure and the nicely done map highlight Kazakhstan\u2019s touristic destinations, both famous ones and hidden gems, and its rich cultural heritage, offering a deeper insight into the wonders that await travelers,\u201d said Vassilenko.",

            "content": "President Trump can\u2019t solve every problem America faces. But the recent arrests of two crooks in New York City highlight two problems he can solve: loose visa-waiver standards and obstacles to removing criminal aliens.\n\nOn Feb. 4, FBI agents arrested Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar, who ran a pawn shop that, according to authorities, fenced luxury goods stolen by Chilean professional burglars who entered the U.S. via the Visa Waiver Program.\n\nMr. Nezhinskiy, a Georgian national living in New Jersey, is believed to be linked to the December 2024 robbery of NFL quarterback Joe Burrow\u2019s home in Ohio. In January, four Chilean nationals were arrested as suspects in that case.\n\nMr. Nezhinskiy and Mr. Villar also have ties to Bryan Leandro Herrera Maldonado, a Chilean who was reportedly responsible for a string of home burglaries across the country in 2019 and 2020.\n\nA different South American crime ring (also likely Chilean) was responsible for the simultaneous burglaries of Kansas City Chiefs players Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce last October.\n\n>>> Sanctuary Cities Pose an Unacceptable Risk to Public Safety\n\nSo how did all these Chilean professional burglars succeed in entering the U.S.? The answer is simple: through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).\n\nThe VWP was created in 1986 to allow travelers from low-risk countries to visit the U.S. for 90 days or less without a visa \u2013 simply after filling out an online form. Currently, 40 countries are members of the program, but Chile (admitted in 2014) is the only one from Latin America.\n\nTo gain admission to the program, Chile had to sign formal agreements promising that it would share its criminal records promptly with the U.S. But over the past few years, U.S. officials have become concerned that Chile isn\u2019t keeping its promises.\n\nIn June 2023, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy called for DHS to suspend Chile from the VWP. In July 2023, two Democratic congressmen from California wrote to the Chilean ambassador complaining about a rash of Orange County burglaries reportedly committed by Chileans who had entered using the VWP.\n\nUntil Chile takes measures to prevent criminals from exploiting the VWP, its participation in the program should not be automatically continued. The U.S. should suspend Chile from the program until we can be sure that they share real-time criminal records with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nApart from Chile and the VWP, the arrest of Mr. Nezhinskiy underlines another problem: obstacles the U.S. faces in deporting foreign criminals.\n\nNezhinskiy is a Georgian national with a U.S. criminal history that dates back to 2001. In 2003, an immigration court ordered that he be deported.\n\nBut according to his recent arrest charges, Nezhinskiy \u201ccannot be returned to his home country.\u201d Presumably, this means that some immigration judge deemed it unsafe to send him back to Georgia.\n\nWhether Georgia is a safe country is debatable, but what is not debatable is that U.S. citizens never invited Nezhinskiy here in the first place but are bearing the burden of harboring recidivist criminals like him.\n\n>>> DOGE Discovers the Biden-Mayorkas Illegal Migration Funding Machine\n\nThe U.S. shouldn\u2019t force innocent Americans to bear the risk of foreign criminals in their midst; instead, we should raise the pressure on \u201crecalcitrant\u201d countries (those who refuse or unreasonably delay taking back their people) by applying economic sanctions or halting visa issuance.\n\nMr. Trump showed the power of such measures when he used the threat of tariffs to persuade Colombia to take back two planeloads of its people on Feb. 1.\n\nIn cases where a country is truly unsafe, there\u2019s still no need for us to let high-risk ex-convicts continue to live here. Instead, we should send them to another country that\u2019s willing to accept them.\n\nRecently, El Salvador\u2019s president Nayib Bukele offered to accept as many criminal aliens as we want to send, at a reasonable cost.\n\nThe U.S. should jump at such an offer\u2014not only will it save taxpayers money, but it\u2019ll accelerate the removal of illegal aliens with criminal records (who are statistically likely to re-offend). Some of these aliens might even decide their home countries aren\u2019t so unsafe after all and return there on their own.\n\nSo no, Mr. Trump can\u2019t fix every problem, but he can take immediate action to fix the visa program and amend deportation practices. If he does, he\u2019ll have made America a much safer place.",

This would continue the annual tradition of offering high-skilled workers a chance to apply for one of the 85,000 coveted spots.\n\nThis year, however, there are concerns over changes to the system, which make it difficult for people affected by the recent wave of tech layoffs to secure a path to stay in the country.\n\nREAD: What a second term for Donald Trump means for H-1B visa seekers (December 10, 2024)\n\nWhile previously employers could submit multiple registrations for a single applicant, increasing their chance of selection, now a foreign worker can be registered only once. This change in the system has been made to focus on \u201cunique beneficiaries,\u201d ensuring that each foreign worker can only be considered once, regardless of the number of employers.\n\n\u201cThe new process ensures a fairer and more transparent selection, reducing the ability to manipulate the system,\u201d the USCIS stated.\n\nWhile some have praised this for being a more equitable system, there have also been concerns over its impact on foreign workers, many of whom are facing employment issues.\n\nThe situation is especially dire for people affected by the recent wave of tech layoffs, especially from big tech companies like Meta, Microsoft and Google.\n\nMeta, in particular, had announced that they would be letting go over 3,000 employees. These workers, who had relied on the stability of their employers for their legal status in the U.S, now have to face the struggle of securing another job before their visa status becomes tenable.\n\nREAD: Enter Stephen Miller: Trump\u2019s hardline immigration agenda takes shape (November 11, 2024)\n\nThe H-1B visa program has long been a key avenue for skilled foreign workers to enter the U.S. and contribute to industries ranging from technology to healthcare. Critics argue that with the new system in place, the changes could have unintended consequences, especially for those who were laid off in recent times.\n\nWith the H-1B cap registration window set to open in March 2025, employers will need to weigh these competing factors carefully. While the rise in registration fees, government spending cuts, and economic uncertainty may dampen enthusiasm for H-1B filings, the continued expansion of AI-driven industries and concerns over potential future restrictions could sustain or even boost application numbers, wrote immigration attorney Johnson Myalil for The American Bazaar.",

            "content": "Quick Hits\n\nThe U.S. State Department has revised drop box eligibility criteria, limiting it to applicants renewing a visa in the same class that is either still valid or expired within the last twelve months (a departure from the previous forty-eight-month policy for any visa class).\n\nDespite efforts to streamline processing, visa appointments for certain nonimmigrant categories remain backlogged by more than a year.\n\nU.S. Mission India broke records in 2024, issuing more than one million nonimmigrant visas for the second year in a row, underscoring the huge demand of Indians for travel to the United States for tourism, business, and education.\n\nInterview Waiver (Drop Box) Changes\n\nAccording to U.S. Mission India\u2019s appointment scheduling service, applicants seeking a waiver of the standard visa interview requirement must meet stricter eligibility criteria:\n\nApplicants must have a previous U.S. visa in the same class as the visa they are applying for.\n\nThe prior visa must be either still valid or have expired within the past twelve months.\n\nThis is a significant change from the previous policy, which permitted drop box processing for applicants with a visa in any category that had expired within the past forty-eight months.\n\nThe U.S. Visa Service Desk is advising visa applicants who have already scheduled an interview waiver appointment to review their eligibility. If they are no longer eligible for an interview waiver under the new criteria, they must cancel the existing appointment and reschedule a biometric and consular appointment for an in-person interview.\n\nThe narrower eligibility criteria mean more applicants will have to attend in-person visa interviews, which may further impact currently posted visa wait times:\n\nCity/Post Interview Required Student/Exchange Visitors (F, M, J) Interview Required Petition-Based Temporary Workers (H, L, O, P, Q) Interview Required Crew and Transit (C, D, C1/D) Interview Required Visitors (B1/B2) Chennai (Madras) 85 Days 28 Days 9 Days 436 Days Hyderabad 85 Days 15 Days 1 Day 429 Days Kolkata 375 Days 415 Days Mumbai (Bombay) 302 Days 10 Days 444 Days New Delhi 85 Days 37 Days 442 Days\n\nSource: U.S. Department of State\u2014Bureau of Consular Affairs\n\nU.S. Mission India advises that drop box processing typically takes up to three weeks from document submission at a Visa Application Center (VAC) until the visa is ready for pick-up or delivery. However, due to the more restrictive eligibility criteria, more applicants will be required to schedule in-person interviews, potentially exacerbating wait times.\n\nNonimmigrant Visa (NIV) Rescheduling Policy\n\nEffective January 1, 2025, the following rescheduling rules apply to nonimmigrant visa appointments:\n\nApplicants can initially schedule their visa appointment at any preferred location.\n\nOne free reschedule is permitted.\n\nIf an applicant misses an appointment or needs to reschedule a second time, they must repay the visa fee to book a new appointment.\n\nCentralization of Visa Processing\n\nTo streamline operations, U.S. Mission India has centralized processing for certain visa categories:\n\nFirst-time H & L visa interview appointments \u2192 Centralized in Hyderabad\n\nFirst-time Blanket L visa applications \u2192 Processed in Chennai\n\nB1/B2 interview waiver (drop box) appointments \u2192 Centralized in New Delhi\n\nH & L interview waiver (drop box) appointments \u2192 Centralized in Chennai\n\nRegardless of where the interview waiver appointment is scheduled, applicants can submit documents at any of the five Visa Application Centers (VACs) at no cost:\n\nChennai\n\nHyderabad\n\nKolkata\n\nMumbai\n\nNew Delhi\n\nAlternatively, applicants may submit documents at one of six Document Drop-off Centers for a fee of 850 rupees (approximately USD $9.81) per application:\n\nAhmedabad\n\nBangalore\n\nChandigarh\n\nCochin\n\nJalandhar\n\nPune\n\nIn certain cases, applicants may still be required to attend an in-person interview at the designated consular post where their visa category has been centralized.\n\nNext Steps\n\nGiven the continued high demand and processing delays, stakeholders may want to schedule visa appointments as early as possible to minimize disruptions.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs has not yet announced whether it will extend or expand its domestic visa renewal pilot program, which ran from January to April 2024. With stricter interview waiver eligibility and more applicants now required to attend in-person interviews, visa processing times might increase, potentially leading to longer wait times across multiple visa categories.\n\nOgletree Deakins\u2019 Immigration Practice Group will continue to monitor developments and will publish updates on the Immigration blog as additional information becomes available.\n\nFollow and Subscribe\n\nLinkedIn | Instagram | Webinars | Podcasts",

Kini told the publication that TCS mislabeled frontline workers as managers to use the L-1A visas to bring them to the US. He said the practice began during the first Donald Trump administration in 2017, when rules employment visa rules were tightened.\n\nHe accused seniors of instructing him to falsify internal organisational charts and misrepresent frontline employees as managers in order to bypass scrutiny over the visa requirements, the report said.\n\nKini is among a few other former TCS employees who have filed federal lawsuits against the company under the False Claims Act.\n\nAlso Read | Tesla entering India?

H-1B visas have strict educational and wage requirements that the managerial visas do not require. These visas, intended for managerial transfers, are less regulated than H-1B skilled-worker visas, which have stricter wage and educational requirements. Anil Kini's lawsuit was dismissed earlier this year, but he has appealed the decision, it added.\n\nThe report added that of the 90,000 L-1A visas approved by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) between October 2019 to September 2023, TCS comprised over 6,500. The number is larger than the next six companies combined, it added.\n\nFurther, the Bloomberg investigation report also said that TCS reported significantly fewer managers in its US operations compared to the number of L-1A visas obtained. It cited TCS' 2022 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) report, which stated the company had fewer than 600 executive or managerial positions among its 31,000 strong US worker base.",

            "content": "The United States has quietly reduced the eligibility window for visa interview waivers\u2014commonly known as the dropbox process\u2014from 48 months to 12 months.\n\nThe move is expected to affect thousands of non-immigrant visa holders, including those on H-1B, F-1, and B1/B2 visas, who now face the possibility of mandatory in-person interviews.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nPreviously, individuals whose visas had expired within the past 48 months could use the dropbox system for renewal, a policy introduced during the pandemic to ease consular backlogs. Now, applicants qualify only if their visa expired within 12 months and is in the same category. Those who do not meet this requirement must schedule an in-person interview.\n\nWho will be impacted?\n\nAccording to The National Law Review, the policy shift is expected to cause visa delays and travel disruptions for multiple categories of non-immigrant visa holders, including:\n\nH-1B \u2013 Skilled professionals working in specialized fields.\n\n\u2013 Skilled professionals working in specialized fields. F-1 \u2013 International students in academic programs.\n\n\u2013 International students in academic programs.

L-1 \u2013 Employees transferring within multinational companies.\n\n\u2013 Employees transferring within multinational companies. O-1 \u2013 Individuals with extraordinary abilities in various fields.\n\nApplicants must now renew a visa in the same category that expired within the past 12 months to qualify for dropbox processing. Applicants who do not meet these criteria must schedule an in-person interview, leading to:\n\nIncreased demand for in-person appointments at U.S. consulates.\n\nLonger wait times for interviews in high-volume locations.\n\nPotential travel disruptions for business travellers and professionals needing quick renewals.\n\nWhy the policy change?\n\nThe rollback comes as U.S. visa demand remains at an all-time high. The U.S. Department of State noted a record 1.76 million Indians travelled to the U.S. in 2023 despite ongoing visa challenges.\n\nSpeaking about this change, Saurabh Arora, Founder & CEO of University Living, said, \"This recent change is a move towards a more structured and transparent immigration process. While it may appear inconvenient and lead to longer wait times, it ensures that recent and relevant applicants are prioritized.\"\n\nReflecting upon the positive aspect of the, he further said, \"For Indian H-1B visa holders, a more rigorous assessment will help recognize and support skilled professionals contributing to the U.S. economy. Yes, this shift brings short-term hurdles, but in the long run, it strengthens the integrity of the immigration framework.\"\n\nIn 2022, B1/B2 visa appointment wait times in India had surpassed 999 days, prompting the 48-month dropbox extension. That backlog is far from resolved, with current wait times already over a year in most major cities.",

            "content": "The H-1B visa remains the most popular choice for Indian professionals seeking to work in the US, but many are now scared of more stringent H-1B regulations under President Donald Trump. Then there is the MAGA backlash against H-1B holders. There are multiple options for Indian professionals planning to work in the US other than the H-1B visa, including the lesser-known work visa categories like H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L, O, P, Q, and R visas.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese visas offer viable alternatives for those looking to work in the US, and understanding these options is crucial for both workers and employers to ensure compliance with US immigration laws.\n\nIndian nationals have been the largest group of H-1B visa holders in the US, making up over 70% of all H-1B visa holders in 2023. Of the total H-1B visas issued, 206,591 were awarded to Indian nationals, making up the bulk of the 265,777 issued that year.\n\nThe history of Indian professionals in the US workforce dates back to the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which removed national quotas and opened doors for skilled professionals, such as engineers, scientists, and physicians.\n\nInitially, H-1B visas were predominantly issued to workers from Europe, Canada, the Philippines, and Japan. However, as India\u2019s economic reforms took hold in the 1990s, Indian nationals began to dominate the H-1B visa landscape, particularly in the tech fields.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Immigration Act of 1990 established the H-1B visa, capping annual issuances at 65,000, during a time when the demand for tech professionals in the US was growing rapidly. As fewer American students pursued science and engineering degrees, Indian workers filled this gap and became a common presence in the US job market.\n\nTHE H VISAS: H-2A, H-2B, H-3\n\nThe H-2A visa allows temporary agricultural workers to come to the US when American workers are unavailable to fill these jobs. Similarly, the H-2B visa applies to non-agricultural seasonal jobs, including roles in hospitality, landscaping, and construction.\n\nFor both visas, employers must demonstrate that hiring foreign workers will not negatively impact US labour.\n\nThe H-3 visa, on the other hand, allows foreign nationals to receive specialised training that is not available in their home country. It does not permit general employment but provides valuable experience in a particular field, excluding medical training.\n\nL-1 VISA FOR TRANSFER TO A US COMPANY, O1 FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY\n\nFor professionals working with multinational corporations, the L-1 visa is an excellent alternative to the H-1B. It allows companies to transfer executives, managers, or employees with specialised knowledge to their US offices.\n\nUnlike the H-1B, the L-1 visa has no annual cap, making it a favourable option for qualified professionals within multinational firms.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe O-1 visa is granted to individuals with extraordinary ability in fields such as science, education, business, arts, and sports. Unlike the H-1B, which relies on a lottery system, the O-1 visa is awarded based on merit and talent, making it a preferred option for top-tier professionals.\n\nP-1, Q-1, R-1 VISAS FOR ATHLETES AND ENTERTAINERS\n\nThe P-1 visa is designed for a different field. It is for athletes and entertainers who wish to work in the US in collaboration with American organisations.\n\nOther subcategories, such as P-2 and P-3, cater to artists involved in cultural exchange programs and those participating in unique cultural events, respectively.\n\nThe Q-1 visa facilitates participation in international cultural exchange programs, typically sponsored by US-based organisations. Though less commonly used, the Q visa offers opportunities for individuals involved in cultural and educational exchanges.\n\nThe R-1 visa allows religious workers, including clergy members, to be employed by US religious organisations, provided they have been active members of their religious denomination for at least two years prior to applying.\n\nSOME H-4, L-2 VISA HOLDERS GRANTED WORK PERMITS IN US\n\nFamily members of primary visa holders can also accompany them to the US through dependent visas.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe H-4 visa is available to the family members of H-1B visa holders, allowing them to live in the US, with some H-4 holders also eligible for work permits. The L-2 visa enables family members of L-1 visa holders to reside in the US and, in some cases, work.\n\nThe R-2 visa is for dependents of R-1 religious workers, allowing them to stay in the US, though they cannot work.\n\nIndians were awarded the majority of H-4 visas (160,141 out of 186,748), L-1 visas (25,539 out of 76,671), and L-2 visas (32,047 out of 83,277). India\u2019s presence in the US workforce, especially in the technology and business sectors, remains significant, as evidenced by these statistics.\n\nSo, it isn't just the H-1B visa that Indians can use to work in the US. There are a host of visa categories that can be used for those seeking employment in the US.\n\nPublished By: Priyanjali Narayan Published On: Feb 18, 2025",

Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the CPI increased 0.4%, bringing the 12-month inflation rate to 3.3%, higher than the projections of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. According to Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments, the report spells the end of the Fed's rate-cutting cycles:\n\n\u201cThe \u2018wait and see\u2019 Fed is going to be waiting longer than anticipated after a red-hot January CPI inflation report. This report puts the final nail in the coffin for the rate cut cycle, which we believe is over.\u201d\n\nIn addition, policymakers are also keeping a watch on the White House in the wake of President Donald Trump's advocacy for high tariffs, which might boost prices and make it more difficult for the Fed to reach its goal. Speaking on this, James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said the following:\n\n\u201cThere is no getting away from the fact that this is a hot report and with the sense that potential tariffs run upside risk for inflation the market is understandably of the view the Federal Reserve is going to find it challenging to justify rate cuts in the near future,\u201d\n\nWhile the consumer price index release is a widely cited inflation gauge, it isn't the principal metric the Federal Reserve uses. Rather, the Fed's preferred inflation measure is the personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish later this month, although it also monitors the CPI and other comparable pricing indices. In his remarks before the House Financial Services Committee on February 12, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the Fed's increased emphasis on the PCE measure but acknowledged that \"we're not quite there yet\" on inflation, despite the \"great progress\" that has been done so far.\n\nIn such a macroeconomic environment, the notion of acquiring the best \u201cforever stocks\u201d might appear challenging. That said, although investors may gravitate toward riskier options with bigger potential returns, it is crucial to recognize that long-term stock investments have their worth and importance. With this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some potential forever stocks.",

            "content": "Analysts globally are also advocating for the GARP strategy. For instance, Brian Belski, chief strategist at BMO Capital, recommended that Canadian investors adopt the GARP approach this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nThe strategy has gained popularity not just in the US, but also globally. After Global X launched the first global broad-based index exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Australia using the GARP framework in September 2024, the strategy delivered strong early-stage performance. According to a Global X report, while global equity markets experienced a rally towards the end of 2024, the GARP stocks outperformed the broader market and other factors like quality, rising approximately 20% since the ETF's launch. The report also noted that GARP's success wasn't driven by technology, but rather by broader sectors such as consumer goods, financials, and communication.\n\nThe GARP strategy, popularized by Peter Lynch, aims to strike a balance between growth and value investing by avoiding the extremes of either approach. It focuses on finding growth stocks that have relatively low price-to-earnings ratios under typical market conditions. When these stocks are identified successfully, they can offer strong returns for investors. Historically, the GARP Index has outperformed its benchmark by tracking companies that demonstrate consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuations, and strong earnings potential.\n\nOver the past year, the market has highlighted the importance of diversifying portfolios to manage risk. Selecting stocks that perform well under various economic conditions has consistently been a challenge for investors, as strategies that work in one market may not work in another. For instance, growth and value stocks have shown different performance trends in various market conditions, making both approaches appealing to investors. Combining elements of both strategies can provide a refreshing alternative to traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes into play. Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) is an investment strategy that focuses on finding companies with strong, sustainable earnings growth and appealing valuations in relation to their growth potential. These companies are often in sectors with positive growth trends or have competitive advantages that position them for future success.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cGrowth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the market, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.\u201d\n\nIn the US, a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that the GARP Index delivered an average annual return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, outperforming the broader market\u2019s 9.81% growth. Over the same period, the market\u2019s Growth Index and the Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also highlighted that the GARP Index achieved better risk-adjusted returns compared to both the growth and value indices during this time frame.\n\nA CNBC report also highlighted insights from BMO\u2019s analysts regarding investment strategies to navigate market uncertainties in the U.S. According to the report, investors should consider the GARP approach alongside dividend growth strategies in the current financial landscape. Dividend stocks have historically performed well during inflationary periods, making them a favored choice among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nGARP stocks have reasonable valuations and strong growth potential, which means that their P/E ratios are not necessarily as low as value stocks. For this article, we used the GARP Index (SPXGARPP) and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked 10 dividend companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. These stocks were ranked based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nIs Visa Inc. (V) the Best Major Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA close-up of a modern payments terminal with a pile of credit cards on the side.\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a California-based payment card service company that offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. The company reported strong earnings for fiscal Q1 2025. The company achieved revenue of $9.5 billion, a 10% increase from the previous year. For the quarter ending December 31, 2024, Visa processed 63.8 billion transactions, marking an 11% year-over-year rise. Moreover, payment volume increased by 9% on a constant-dollar basis compared to the same period last year.\n\nDespite ongoing discussions about the potential impact of fintech and alternative payment methods, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)'s competitive edge has only strengthened over time. The company benefits from its vast scale and an inflation-resistant business model. Its performance reflects solid business fundamentals, having achieved a total return compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.6% since going public in 2008.\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) ended the quarter with a robust cash position, with over $16 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Operating cash flow increased to $5.4 billion, up from $3.6 billion in the same quarter last year. The company also returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.67%, as of February 14. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 16 years.\n\nOverall V ranks 1st on our list of the best GARP stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "By Samuel A. Lopez \u2013 USA Herald\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has officially announced that the H-1B visa registration period for 2025 will begin on March 7th, continuing the annual tradition of offering high-skilled workers a chance to apply for one of the 80,000 coveted spots.\n\nHowever, this year\u2019s process comes amid increasing concerns about the changing lottery system, which could make it more difficult for those affected by the recent wave of tech industry layoffs, particularly from major players like Meta, to secure a path to stay in the United States.\n\nPreviously, the H-1B lottery system was based on the number of registrations submitted for a given individual. If an employer submitted multiple registrations for the same applicant, it increased that person\u2019s chances of being selected. But this year, the lottery system is changing. Now, each foreign worker can only be registered once, regardless of how many employers submit applications on their behalf.\n\nThis shift is intended to prevent the abuse of the system, where employers could submit multiple registrations for the same applicant in order to improve their chances of selection. In essence, the new system focuses on \u201cunique beneficiaries\u201d \u2014 ensuring that each foreign worker can only be considered once, regardless of the number of employers involved. The change aims to create a more equitable and fair selection process, which has been hailed by some as a necessary reform, but it also raises questions about its impact on foreign workers already grappling with the challenges of unemployment.\n\nFor those affected by the recent tech layoffs, the new system is further complicating an already challenging situation. Thousands of foreign workers with H-1B visas were laid off by prominent tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google. These workers, who had relied on the stability of their employers for their legal status in the U.S., now face an uphill battle in securing another job before their visa status becomes untenable.\n\nWith the new lottery system, even if a laid-off worker is able to find a new employer willing to sponsor their visa, their chances of being selected in the lottery are significantly reduced. This creates a difficult situation for these workers who may find themselves unable to stay in the U.S. due to the new lottery process.\n\nThe H-1B visa program has long been a key avenue for skilled foreign workers to enter the U.S. and contribute to industries ranging from technology to healthcare. But with the new system in place, critics argue that the changes could have unintended consequences, especially for those who were laid off due to no fault of their own. By focusing on \u201cunique beneficiaries,\u201d USCIS is essentially eliminating the possibility of gaming the system through multiple registrations.\n\nThe changes may serve to make the lottery system more transparent and equitable, but for those who have already been displaced, it represents another layer of difficulty in an already complex process.",

The interview waiver program simplifies the procedure to apply for a U.S. visa stamp by eliminating the requirement for eligible individuals to attend in-person visa interviews at U.S. embassies and consulates.\n\nUpdated Visa Interview Waiver Eligibility Criteria\n\nEffective immediately, eligibility to waive the in-person visa interview is limited to applicants renewing a visa in the same nonimmigrant classification that expired within the past 12 months, in addition to other general requirements. Previously, applicants qualified if their visa had expired within the last 48 months and, in some cases, qualified for an interview waiver when applying for a visa classification for the first time. This prior policy was introduced during COVID-19 to reduce consular backlogs.\n\nUnder both the current and prior eligibility criteria, applicants seeking an interview waiver must apply in their country of nationality or residence and qualify only if they have never been refused a visa (unless overcome or waived) and have no other ineligibility.\n\nImpact on Nonimmigrant Visa Applicants\n\nThis rollback could have significant implications for H-1B, L-1, O-1, and other nonimmigrant visa holders who previously relied on eligibility for an interview waiver. Applicants who no longer meet the stricter criteria must now schedule an in-person visa interview at a U.S. consulate. Recent reports indicate that some applicants with scheduled visa processing based on an interview waiver were turned away and instructed to schedule in-person interview appointments instead. Other key impacts may include:\n\nIncreased demand for in-person visa appointments and longer wait times for appointments, particularly in high-volume locations, as consulates absorb an increased volume of in-person interviews.\n\nPotential travel disruptions for those expecting to use processing based on an interview waiver. Advance planning of travel will be required as availability of in-person appointments may vary.\n\nConsiderations for Nonimmigrant Visa Applicants",

Applicants also previously could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued another nonimmigrant visa other than a B-1/B-2 visa (e.g., an individual who had been issued an F-1 visa which had not expired more than 48 months could qualify for interview waiver when applying for an H-1B visa).\n\nThe full interview waiver criteria can be found here.\n\nAdditional Information: Applicants can submit a visa application and documentation for interview waiver processing at Visa Application Centers in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru and other locations that can be found here.\n\nIndividuals who have applied for visas and who have appointments to drop off their documentation for interview waiver processing may no longer qualify for an interview waiver. Foreign nationals are reminded to speak with their BAL team prior to international travel and to be aware of general travel requirements, including maintaining a valid visa in their passport.\n\nOther U.S. embassies and consulates that may have updated their interview waiver eligibility criteria include but are not limited to Mexico, France and Japan. All Visa renewal applicants should check interview waiver criteria on their respective U.S. embassy or consulate\u2019s website to confirm.\n\nThis alert has been provided by the BAL U.S. Practice Group.",

A crowd of supporters stood by her as she tearfully spoke about the uncertainty of her future and the heartbreak over the possibility of not seeing her students next week.\n\nRuano is a mother of 9-year-old twin daughters. She works as a paraprofessional at ALBA School in Milwaukee. She shared her story publicly as the possibility of being separated from her children grew closer.\n\nWhile Ruano was inside with her attorneys, daughters, and some members of the Milwaukee Common Council, several people stayed outside as a show of support.\n\nVoces de la Frontera has been working with Ruano.\n\n\"She, like many others, is not someone who is causing harm.

She left El Salvador in 2011 because of gang violence.\n\n\"They love her. She has such a warm presence, used to being constantly hugged by students, even faculty. She's a grand presence at school,\" said friend and co-worker Sandra Sanchez Segura.\n\nLate Friday morning, Ruano walked out with renewed hope. She was granted more time to process her T visa application, which allows certain victims of human trafficking to remain in the United States.\n\n\"We do want to thank the ICE Milwaukee field office today for their communication and their collaboration,\" attorney Allison Mignon said. \"We will continue working with Yessenia, working with ICE to find the best solution for her case.\"\n\nMilwaukee Common Council members Alderman Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez and Alderwoman JoCasta Zamarripa stood with Ruano.\n\n\"She (Ruano) has been entrusted by hundreds of families to teach and take care of their kids in our school system. She\u2019s exactly the kind of person that we need to work with, support, and should stay here,\" P\u00e9rez said.\n\nThe timeline moving forward was unclear.\n\n\"Thank you all for your support, for your prayers, for everything.

The exact amount depends on the payment network (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or American Express), the type of credit card, and the merchant category code (MCC) of the business.\n\nNote that debit cards have a different pricing model, and they usually cost less for merchants.

Previously, this period was 48 months.This change, effective immediately, impacts nonimmigrant visa holders, including H-1B and B1/B2 applicants, who previously benefited from the relaxed rules introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.While no official announcement has been made, Visa Application Centers (VACs) have reportedly begun enforcing the new policy, turning away applicants who do not meet the revised criteria, according to The National Law Review.Previously, applicants with a visa that had expired within the past 48 months could renew their visa through the dropbox process. This policy, implemented in 2022, was aimed at addressing long wait times at US embassies and consulates.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)The return to the pre-pandemic 12-month eligibility rule means that only those whose prior visa expired within the past year can apply without an in-person interview.The decision is expected to cause delays and disruptions for Indian applicants:Despite the challenges, travel between India and the US continues to rise. A record number of Indians traveled to the US in 2023, surpassing 1.76 million visitors. However, long visa wait times and limited direct flight options remain barriers to further growth.The rollback comes at a time when visa appointment wait times remain high. In 2022, wait times for B1/B2 visa interviews in India exceeded 999 days, prompting the U.S. to extend dropbox eligibility to 48 months. Currently, appointment wait times remain lengthy:With the revised dropbox rules, more applicants will require in-person appointments, further straining the system.",

These are the best countries for remote workers. Here are seven countries with digital nomad visas if you're looking to move abroad.\n\nGolden visas, also known as residency by investment schemes, allow foreigners to live, work, and study in a country by making a significant financial investment.\n\nThese visas, while offering travel and residency benefits, have drawn criticism for potentially driving up housing costs and favoring the wealthy.\n\nThe cost of golden visas varies by country, often involving real estate purchases, government bonds, or donations starting from around \u20ac250,000.\n\nAs more Americans consider gaining residency overseas, golden visas can seem enticing.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the number of Americans seeking a second passport or alternative residence abroad due to \"economic and political uncertainties\" skyrocketed by 504%, according to Henley & Partners, a residence and citizenship by investment firm.\n\n\"Political turmoil is always a catalyst for our business because people are always looking for a safe haven,\" said Denis Kravchenko, business development director at immigration investment firm Astons. \"The bottom line is that people want to safeguard their legacy, essentially in terms of assets. How can they protect it from taxes? How can they protect it from whatever mess will happen and so on?\"\n\nGolden visas are a desirable way for those with extra cash to \"buy\" residency in another country with a financial investment. Although they've been around for decades, these residency schemes are gaining steam among Americans, who now account for about half of Greece's golden visa applicants this year, according to Astons.\n\nHere's what to know about golden visas:\n\nWhat does a second passport do? It can be rigorous to get but offers something visas can't\n\nWhat are golden visas?\n\nAlso known as residency by investment schemes, golden visas allow foreigners to legally live, work, and study in another country as long as they invest in the local economy.\n\n\"It sounds posh, it does, but in reality, it's a very straightforward thing,\" said Kravchenko. \"It's a residency status, which is long; it's temporary, but can be at least five years.\"\n\nOnce a foreigner establishes residency in a country like the European Union, traveling freely across member states becomes much more convenient \u2013 and there's the option to renew.\n\nUnlike digital nomad visas or other residency visas, golden visas don't require you to be present in the host country for a long period. In Portugal, you only need to be there seven days per year. They provide a good backup in case you want to move abroad. \"If you don't have an immediate relocation plan \u2013 which is 99.9% of the cases \u2013 you would probably want to prepare yourself toward like you do it now, and if things go south, you make a decision of relocation,\" Kravchenko said.\n\nHowever, the surge in golden visas has prompted some countries, like Spain, to discontinue their schemes following residents' pushback. The Mediterranean country's program \u2013 requiring the purchase of real estate costing at least \u20ac500,000 (about $518,192) \u2013 will officially end on April 3. Last year, the Spanish island of Mallorca saw a 12% increase in U.S. buyers, with locals saying the influx of foreigners drove home prices to become unaffordable.\n\nHow much do golden visas cost?\n\nThe required investment isn't cheap and usually comes in the form of purchasing real estate, government stocks, or a nonrefundable donation. The minimum amount in some of the lower-cost popular schemes starts at \u20ac250,000 (about $259,000) in Greece and Portugal, according to Astons. In places like Greece, the real estate investment can be a \"basic apartment,\" according to Kravchenko.\n\nHow can I get a golden visa?\n\nIf your paperwork is organized and with the assistance of an investment firm like Astons, it could take as little as four months for your application to be approved in Greece. However, many schemes are highly selective. \"Because all of those options, they have extreme and tough compliance,\" Kravchenko said. \"Obviously, the source of income, source of funds, making sure that there's no criminal record, and so on.\"\n\nThe timeline can take up to a year for destinations popular among expatriating Americans, like Portugal. Bloomberg reported that the European country is just now completing a backlog of nearly 50,000 golden visa applications.\n\nTop countries for golden visas",

Notably absent from Trump\u2019s agenda is ending the Diversity Visa lottery, though he\u2019s criticized the program in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany Americans may not be aware that the program\u2014commonly known as the \u201cgreen card lottery\u201d\u2014offers randomly selected participants a legal immigration pathway and is popular around the world. The Immigration Act of 1990, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, established the program, so ending it would require Trump to work with Congress.\n\nTrump has every reason to do so, and Americans have good reason to learn about the program, since it has tended to undermine their interests.\n\nMillions of people worldwide each year submit their entries for the green card lottery. In 2023, a staggering number applied\u2014nearly 22.2 million, an increase of nearly eight million from 2022. The State Department, which administers the program, annually grants up to 55,000 immigrant visas that are randomly selected from all entries.\n\nThe program\u2019s purpose is to boost ethnic diversity among America\u2019s immigrant population. Preference is given to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.\n\nEnacted in fiscal year 1995, the Diversity Visa program has directly brought over 1.5 million immigrants to the United States, but indirectly facilitated the arrival of millions more. Since the lottery began, its winners have collectively sponsored around 4 million relatives to join them in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sheer number of immigrants entering the country through the Diversity Visa is not the sole reason to abolish it. The lottery\u2019s selection process chooses individuals regardless of their education, skill, or the economic needs of the United States. Such randomness contradicts meritocratic values that America has prized since its founding and which have made the country great.\n\nBesides lacking a meritocratic foundation, the Diversity Visa lottery is susceptible to criminal activity and fraud. Since the program serves as a gateway to America and U.S. citizenship, the stakes are high. Unsurprisingly, there have been numerous instances of document forgery and false representation.\n\nThe U.S. consular corps allocates considerable time and effort to verifying the authenticity of submitted documents. However, many applicants come from countries where it is common practice to bribe government officials to obtain fraudulent documents that appear legitimate.\n\nNumerous criminal enterprises are associated with the lottery. Although the application is free, billboards and shop signs in African and Eastern European capitals advertise false guarantees of selection\u2014for a hefty price.\n\nThese practices not only undermine the American immigration system and the rule of law but also allow potentially dangerous individuals to enter the country. In 2004, U.S. government officials warned of national security risks associated with granting visas to green card lottery winners from countries with ties to terrorism, yet these concerns were often dismissed by the mainstream liberal media.\n\nUnfortunately, these worries have proven to be justified. The 2002 Los Angeles International Airport shooting was the first terrorist attack carried out by a participant in the Diversity Visa lottery. More recently, in 2017, green card lottery winners orchestrated two terrorist attacks\u2014a truck attack and a subway bombing\u2014in New York City, resulting in eight deaths and 13 injuries. Following these attacks, President Trump called for the program's termination.\n\nIn addition to posing national security threats, the program also raises legitimate concerns about resource allocation and time management. Rather than focusing their efforts on processing applications for the spouses of U.S. citizens and service members, consular staff spend countless hours verifying the authenticity of documents submitted by green card lottery winners.\n\nThese resources, along with American taxpayers' money, could be better utilized by addressing more pressing issues, rather than processing the random winners of a poorly conceived immigration lottery.\n\nImmigration policy should be driven by the economic, scientific and security needs of the country, prioritizing immigrants whose skills and knowledge could plausibly benefit the nation. The Diversity Visa lottery doesn\u2019t adhere to these priorities, instead granting residence permits to immigrants who lack useful skills and sometimes are much too old to acquire them.\n\nEfforts to end the program have been ongoing since 2005, even as public awareness of the program has been sporadic and limited. With Republicans in control of Congress, President Trump now has an historic opportunity to terminate the Diversity Visa lottery and build a more rational immigration system that would help make America great again.",

            "content": "Trade, tariffs and visas to dominate Trump-Modi talks\n\n13 February 2025 Share Save Michael Kugelman Foreign policy analyst Share Save\n\nAFP Narendra Modi at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris on Tuesday\n\nWhen Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington and meets President Donald Trump later on Thursday, there will be some warm hugs and shared laughs. But that will not be all. Trump and Modi have developed a strong personal rapport over the years, marked by high-profile meetings and joint appearances. This time, they will also hold a joint press briefing, according to the White House. Since their first meeting in Washington in 2017, their bond has grown through other events, including joint appearances at massive rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad. Their chemistry stems from shared worldviews and politics and a mutual strategic focus on countering China, a concern that has also strengthened the broader US-India partnership. Not surprisingly, Trump has often criticised India, but he has never criticised Modi. And so, during Modi's visit, the two leaders will probably spend time mapping out next steps in the US-India strategic partnership, which is already in a good place. Modi will reportedly meet several members of Trump's cabinet, as well as US business leaders and members of the Indian-American community. He may also meet SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk. Modi, keen to scale up India's burgeoning electric vehicles sector, would be happy if Musk opened a Tesla factory in India.\n\nGetty Images Trump and Modi meeting previously, in Delhi in 2020\n\nAnd yet the Trump-Modi conviviality and heady talk of strategic partnership may mask a sobering reality: during Modi's visit, the relationship's transactional side will come into sharp relief with each leader, especially Trump, armed with an array of demands. Delhi knows Trump well. Many of Modi's current cabinet ministers also served during his previous term, which overlapped with part of the first Trump administration. That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil. It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration. Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (\u00a337.10bn) in recent years. On Wednesday evening, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump planned to announce reciprocal tariffs on other countries before his meeting with Modi. But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides. In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements. What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\n\nGetty Images In 2019, thousands of Indian-Americans attended an event in Houston where Modi and Trump made a joint appearance\n\nTrump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate. Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger. Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil. In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US. Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel. India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment. Technology will probably be discussed as well. This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it. Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will. Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US.\n\nGetty Images Delhi is working with Tehran to develop a port in Iran's Chabahar city",

            "content": "Dividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts\u2014they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years\u2014such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative\u2014they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nDividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nDividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market\u2019s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn\u2019t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Growth Stocks With 10%+ Yearly Increases . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index\u2019s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.\n\nWithin the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:V)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 15.4%\n\nAn American multinational payment card service company, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. The company's growth is largely fueled by the global shift towards digital payments, a trend accelerated by technological advancements. Despite the progress in electronic transactions, cash still remains the primary payment method in many developing areas, presenting a significant opportunity for growth. As per the Federal Reserve, cash use dropped to 16% of transactions in 2024, highlighting the increasing preference for digital payments. Younger generations, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, are leading this change, favoring contactless and mobile payment methods. Demographic shifts and advancing technology continue to drive the widespread adoption of digital wallets and other cashless solutions.\n\nIn fiscal Q1 2025, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported $9.5 billion in revenue, reflecting a 10% increase from the same period last year. The company processed 63.8 billion transactions in the quarter ending December 31, 2024, marking an 11% rise compared to the previous year. Payment volume also saw a 9% year-over-year increase on a constant-dollar basis.\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) also showed a strong cash position, ending the quarter with over $16 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Operating cash flow for the quarter reached $5.4 billion, up from $3.6 billion in the prior-year period. The company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. It pays a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.68%, as of February 8. V is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company maintains a 16-year streak of consistent dividend growth.\n\nOverall V ranks 2nd on our list of the best dividend stocks with dividend growth rates. While we acknowledge the potential for V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Announcer: Welcome to the Ogletree Deakins podcast, where we provide listeners with brief discussions about important workplace legal issues. Our podcasts are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal advice. You can subscribe through your favorite podcast service. Please consider rating this podcast so we can get your feedback and improve our programs. Please enjoy the podcast.\n\nKara Lancaster: Welcome to part two of our immigration podcast on H-1B Visa applications. I\u2019m Kara Lancaster, a shareholder in our Raleigh office. I\u2019m here with Meagan Dziura, who is a senior attorney also in Ogletree\u2019s, Raleigh office.\n\nMeagan Dziura: Kara, if someone is selected in the H-1B lottery, how are they filing the H-1B? What is the typical process for that?\n\nKara Lancaster: There\u2019s two different options for how we file the H-1B petition for those who are selected. The first option is known as a change of status, and this means that you\u2019re requesting USCIS to automatically switch your underlying visa status from the existing visa to H-1B within the United States. And so, in order to request a change of status, the individual does have to be physically inside the United States at the time that the petition is filed. So again, we have some flexibility there. There\u2019s the 90-day window of when we file, so usually from April 1st to June 30th. And so, they need to be inside the United States not only on the day that we file, but also while the application is being processed, so up until the petition is approved.\n\nA lot of times foreign national employees will have questions around how long that period is. How long is this travel restriction period? And it depends, right? It depends on how long USCIS takes to approve the petition. You can have a little bit more control over that time period if the employer is filing under premium processing, where we get an update from USCIS within 15 business days, but under regular processing, it could be several months. Even with premium, there\u2019s always a chance of receiving a request for additional evidence that can extend the time period before we get the approval. So that\u2019s the main thing we\u2019re always highlighting with a change of status is that the individual needs to be able to stay in the U.S. while that application is being processed. But once it\u2019s approved either on or after October 1st, that is when their status will automatically change over to H-1B. So again, October 1st is usually the date that it will switch, but if for some reason the process extended beyond that, then it would be on whatever date the petition is approved.\n\nIf that individual then travels outside the U.S. after their status has already changed over to H-1B, then they will apply for the H-1B visa in their passport from a U.S. embassy before returning to the United States. One exception to this would be for Canadian nationals since they are visa-exempt, but everyone else would want to make sure they get that visa in their passport from a U.S. embassy or consulate. And so, that\u2019s also one, I would say, misconception there is that choosing a change of status doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to have to get the visa in your passport the next time you travel. It just means that you were already holding H-1B status in the U.S. before you traveled.\n\nSo then, that brings me to the second filing option, which is referred to as consular notification or consular processing. If we file the H-1B petition with a request for consular notification, there are no travel restrictions because we are essentially saying to USCIS that we want this petition to be approved and only be activated if the individual chooses to activate it at a U.S. embassy or consulate overseas. And so, when we file the petition this way, the individual will remain in their current visa status beyond October 1st. They\u2019ll remain in that status until they get that H-1B visa stamp in their passport and travel back to the U.S.\n\nA lot of times clients will have policies around this in the sense that if somebody opts for consular notification, then it will be their responsibility to make that travel plan in the future to activate the H-1B, a lot of times maybe before their current visa or work authorization expires. And then the one other note here is that the individual cannot enter the U.S. more than 10 days prior to the start of the H-1B validity. And so, if for some reason somebody chose consular notification but did want to activate it fairly soon, they just want to make sure they don\u2019t try to activate it too early because the soonest they can come into the U.S. is 10 days before that start date, which again is usually October 1st.\n\nBut a lot of times we see people choose consular notification for two main reasons. One would be because they have a lot of travel plans between April and June. Sometimes, we can work around those travel plans. If somebody has travel in April, we could say, okay, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll file in May or June. But if they just have a lot of travel throughout that period and they just don\u2019t want to worry about being restricted, sometimes they prefer consular notification and they say, \u201cOkay, I understand it\u2019s on me to activate this H-1B overseas at a consulate.\u201d\n\nThe other reason that we see a lot is if somebody\u2019s spouse is working on a dependent visa. A lot of times L-1 employees have a spouse working in L-2 status, and so there are some considerations and hurdles sometimes to an H-4 spouse obtaining work authorization. And so, those employees might decide, \u201cLet me just stay an L-1 status for now. We\u2019ll get the H-1B approval, and we will figure out a time that makes sense to activate it and switch over to H-1B and H-4 dependent status at a future date.\u201d\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s something that we often see in terms of why people choose consular notification. Otherwise, a change of status is pretty common outside of those scenarios, especially for F-1 students, anyone that knows they\u2019re going to need to switch over to the H-1B in order to stay work authorized to stay in the U.S., a lot of times those individuals will choose a change of status so that they know it\u2019s done, they\u2019re already an H-1B status, and it happens automatically within the U.S. without them having to do anything else.\n\nMeagan Dziura: Yeah, and you mentioned F-1 students, so reasons why F-1 students would be one of the main cap candidates for companies is because they do get work authorization, or they can get work authorization after they graduate from a U.S. university, but that is a limited work authorization. It\u2019s typically only one year. They may get a two-year extension if they\u2019re working, or if they graduated in a STEM field, but after that, they would need to look for employment-sponsored immigration. So, a lot of the cap candidates we see are F-1 students, and the degree completion requirements for that, they must have completed the requirements for the degree prior to filing the H-1B. It doesn\u2019t have to be prior to the registration period. So that\u2019s an important distinction, and like I said, usually, the final file date is June 30th.\n\nThere\u2019s also a special provision that is provided for F-1 students, and this is so that F-1 students, if their work authorization is expiring before that October 1st date that Kara mentioned for change of status, H-1B cap petitions, if their work authorization is expiring before that, as long as their H-1B cap petition is filed while they\u2019re still work authorized, their work authorization is automatically extended up until September 30th, so the day before that October 1st date. So, it\u2019s a special consideration for F-1s. It\u2019s something that companies and something that Ogletree definitely looks at for the F-1 population because even though the filing, the general filing 90-day period usually ends at the end of June, some F-1 students may need to have that petition filed basically immediately. So, something to really, really consider to make sure there\u2019s not a gap in employment for F-1 students.\n\nWe also usually recommend that F-1 students do that change of status petition and avoid the international travel. It can become tricky just because the F-1 you do usually need to have that valid visa, you need to have an I-20 that\u2019s endorsed for travel. Typically, you would need your EAD approved as well. There\u2019s just a lot of extra hurdles for an F-1. And then, if they don\u2019t have the ability to come back into the U.S. until they get that H-1B, they, of course, have to wait for that approval. And like Kara said, they would need to visit a consulate, and they can\u2019t enter the U.S. until they\u2019re 10 days before that ten one date. So again, typically we recommend the F-1s do a change of status petition for the H-1B filing.\n\nAnother group of employees that we are looking at for the cap registrants is the L-1 visa. Kara mentioned this in the beginning. The L-1, they have strict maximum time limits in U.S. For L-1B, that maximum stay is five years. And for an L-1A, which is the managerial visa, the maximum stay is seven years. Back in the day, green cards, if an employer wanted to sponsor an L-1 for a green card, five years may be plenty of time for them to go through a perm-based green card process. In L-1A, the wait times were much shorter if you wanted to do an EB-1 green card for a manager. Most birth categories were current for EB-1s, and that\u2019s just not the case anymore. PERM is also becoming more and more difficult just because there are so many people looking for jobs right now. It\u2019s much harder to certify that you did not find a well and qualified able US worker. It\u2019s becoming just harder to get a green card within these time restrictions of five and seven years.\n\nSo, because the H-1B is more flexible since you can extend it past its six-year limit if you reach a certain point in the green card process, a lot of companies are now considering putting Ls in the H-1B lottery that they may not have considered before. This is probably one of the main questions that I get at least with my clients, is when we reach out to people on L visas and say, \u201cHey, your company has authorized us to put you in the H-1B lottery,\u201d they say, \u201cWhy, I\u2019m on an L?\u201d And then we have to explain how long the timelines are for a green card, to wait for a green card, and just how uncertain certain green card processes are, like the PERM process.\n\nSo we really do want to have that backup H-1B for them, even if they\u2019re not switching immediately, like a change of status, we do recommend an H-1B as an option in case they do need to switch over because they\u2019re running out of L time because, again, that L cannot be extended past the limits unless they go abroad, stay for a year and come back. So that\u2019s something that we are really encouraging clients to look at this year. Last year, we definitely encouraged it, as well. And likely going forward, we would continue to encourage it just because it\u2019s unlikely that the green card process will become any shorter or easier.\n\nSo, Kara, can you talk about some of the other visa types and why we would consider or why would we encourage employers to consider putting them into the H-1B lottery?\n\nKara Lancaster: Yeah, obviously the F-1 students and the L-1 visa holders I would say tend to be the largest groups, but there are some other visa types that we see commonly go into the lottery. So, visas like the TN for Canadian and Mexican nationals, the E-3 visa for Australian nationals and H-1B ones, which is for nationals of Singapore and Chile. These are treaty visas. And so, one reason that we often have clients put these individuals into the lottery is because treaties could be changed, especially when we\u2019re changing administrations in the U.S. We don\u2019t necessarily have any concrete reason to think that those treaties would be changed or removed, but it is always possible. And so just to, again, always have a backup option. The H-1B is something that would give them that backup in case something were to change with the underlying treaty associated with their visa.\n\nThe other common reason, and I would say the bigger reason is what we talked about before, immigrant intent. And so, these treaty visas, the TN, E-3, H-1B one, they do not allow for dual intent. They do not allow for immigrant intent in terms of planning on staying in the U.S. permanently. And it\u2019s a little bit tricky because these visas don\u2019t have hard limits like the L-1 visa for example. So sometimes there\u2019s a misconception that they can be renewed forever. And that\u2019s half true because there is no regulatory limit on how many times they can be extended, but ultimately, the intention behind these visas is for the individual to be in the U.S. temporarily. They are supposed to intend on returning to their home country eventually.\n\nAnd so, if that\u2019s not the case, if plans change and they do prefer to pursue permanent residence in the U.S. or think that they might want to do that, then switching over to the H-1B allows them to have that dual intent. It allows for them to plan on staying in the U.S. on a permanent basis. And it\u2019s usually, again, the first step to then pursuing permanent residency.\n\nMeagan Dziura: I\u2019ll also just add with the O-1 visa, which is a little more, we usually call it quasi dual intent, it has a little less restrictions than some of the treaty visas, but the O-1, it can be extended indefinitely, but only in one-year increments when you\u2019re in the U.S., extending with USCIS. And because of that, a lot of employers opt to put people who are in O-1 status into the H-1B cap because the O-1 is also usually a large undertaking. It can be a really large petition. It\u2019s for those who are essentially of extraordinary or outstanding ability. So the O-1, to have to renew that every year can be burdensome for employers. So the O-1 is another one that we sometimes see go into the H-1B lottery.\n\nI talked a lot about the announcement that the fiscal year 2025 lottery was officially closed in December. This is because they had a second round of selections. And when USCIS has additional slots open after the first round, they look at how many people actually used those selected slots. And sometimes, they have allocated those other slots, and people haven\u2019t used them. So, they do sometimes have multiple lottery rounds. The past two years, we did have additional rounds. There have been additional rounds over the past five years, but the past two years, we have had additional rounds. So, it\u2019s never concrete. We can never predict that there will be an additional round this next upcoming year. It wouldn\u2019t be announced until after the initial lottery is finished. Usually not announced until they see how many filings are actually collected, but like we said, the last two years, they have had additional rounds. So that\u2019s always a possibility, and we usually don\u2019t get a huge heads up about it. Sometimes, USCIS literally just starts changing the status of in their USAS registration. So, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re always looking out for to see if there\u2019s any indication that USAS has started making new selections past June 30th.\n\nThat\u2019s basically our prep guidelines. We\u2019ll likely be doing another episode once the H-1B lottery is closed, where we\u2019ll talk about alternative options for employees that weren\u2019t selected. So, you can look for that after April 2025.\n\nThank you, Kara, for being here.\n\nKara Lancaster: Yeah, thanks.\n\nMeagan Dziura: Thanks so much for listening.

            "content": "Independent MP Ayoub Khan has tabled a motion in parliament urging the British government to \"urgently establish\" a visa scheme for Palestinians with family ties in Britain.\n\nThe move comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Wednesday that the government would seek to prevent Palestinian refugees from living in the UK using a refugee scheme established for Ukranians.\n\n\"Recognising the humanitarian crisis continuing to be faced by many Palestinians,\" Khan's motion reads, \"it is imperative that the UK underscores its commitment to humanitarian aid and support for those affected by conflict by facilitating their ability to reunite with families already residing in Britain.\"\n\nStarmer insisted in parliament that the Home Office will shut a \"legal loophole\" that allowed a Palestinian refugee family from Gaza to stay in the UK.\n\nThis came after it emerged that a judge ruled six Palestinians from Gaza - a mother, a father and four children - could remain in Britain using the Ukraine Family Scheme, a visa programme originally established for Ukranian refugees fleeing the war following Russia's invasion.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nThe opposition Conservative Party slammed the decision, with party leader Kemi Badenoch declaring in parliament on Wednesday that it \"cannot be allowed to stand\".\n\nStarmer replied: \"I do not agree with the decision. She is right, it is the wrong decision.\"\n\nHe added that \"the home secretary has already got her team working on closing the loophole. We don't need to wait for that. We're getting on with that because we're taking control.\"\n\nThe Home Office warned that the legal decision would \"open the floodgates for all those in conflict zones with family in the UK\" to come to Britian.\n\n'Unjust and arbritary barriers'\n\nThe Home Office refused an initial application by the Palestinian family in May last year, but in September an immigration tribunal ruled in their favour.\n\nA spokesperson from the Gaza Families Reunited Campaign, a grassroots collective, said: \"We are relieved that this family has won their legal case and will hopefully be reunited soon. However, their struggle highlights the unjust and arbitrary barriers preventing Palestinians in Gaza from finding safety with their loved ones in the UK.\n\n\"We are dismayed by the Government's stated focus on 'closing the loophole' that enabled this particular family to flee the bloodshed, rather than providing Palestinians in Gaza with a practical means of reuniting with their loved ones in the UK.\"\n\n'What\u2019s good for one group of persecuted people should be good for everyone. The same legal principles should apply whether these people are Ukrainian or Palestinian.' - Ayoub Khan MP\n\nAyoub Khan MP told MEE that the government's move is \"disgraceful\".\n\n\"I wholeheartedly refute the notion from the Home Office that such a scheme will open the floodgates,\" he said.\n\n\"Very few Palestinians will ever voluntarily leave their home due to the spiritual and sentimental attachment they have to the land. The vast majority would rather return to rubble and rebuild - even when the conditions outside are far superior to those inside.\"\n\nHowever, Khan added: \"For the minority that do need to leave - whether it\u2019s because of the need for urgent medical treatment or to be reunited with family in Britain - what\u2019s good for one group of persecuted people should be good for everyone.\n\n\"The same legal principles should apply whether these people are Ukrainian or Palestinian.\n\n\"In Britain we have a proud history of being a country of sanctuary for those fleeing persecution. This is once again the Labour Party appeasing the far right under threat from Reform.\"\n\nRupert Lowe, a Reform UK MP, posted online that the judge's decision was \"deranged insanity\" and called for the sacking of immigration judges who are \"found to be actively working against the interests of the British people, and in favour of their own political desires.\n\n\"The system should work for Britain, not Gaza,\" he added.",

            "content": "The Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card is an option if you have bad credit, but it's not ideal.\n\nSure, it's an unsecured Visa card, meaning it doesn't require an upfront security deposit and will be widely accepted. And it reports payment activity to the three main credit bureaus, so it can help you build credit. But the benefits end there because the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card, issued by The Bank of Missouri, charges an absolute onslaught of pointless fees, along with a jaw-dropping interest rate.\n\nEven though some other credit cards for bad credit (FICO scores of 629 or lower) have annual fees and high interest rates, the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card takes this to a new level.\n\nOther credit cards can help you build credit with careful use, and the costs won't be as high.\n\nHere are five things to know about the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card.\n\n1. It's loaded with fees\n\nTo carry and use the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card, get ready to pay these fees:\n\nProgram fee: You must pay this $95 fee within 60 days of your application being accepted. You can't activate your new card until you fork over the money. Generally speaking, \"program fees\" are not a thing for most credit cards, even among those meant for bad credit.\n\nAnnual fee: The card charges an annual fee of $75 for the first year, then $48. While annual fees are much more common for credit cards \u2014 and they can be worth paying \u2014 the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card is more expensive than other cards in its class. (Editor's Note: On May 11, 2023, Total Visa's annual fee increased to $125 for the first year, only to revert back to $75 six days later on May 17.)\n\nMonthly servicing fee: This is waived for the first year and costs $8.25 per month after that (as of May 17, 2023). That translates to $99 per year.\n\nExpress shipping fee: If you want to receive your card more quickly than normal, you'll have to pay a $35 \"express shipping fee.\"\n\nOther fees: Depending on your card use, you may incur late payment fees, cash advance fees, a fee for another card for an authorized user, and even a fee to increase your credit limit. And if you're feeling fancy, you can choose a \"premium plastic card design\" for an extra cost. (How much? The issuer won't say exactly: \"The cost of the selected card will be disclosed to you at the time you select it, however, will never exceed $10.00.\") So save your cash and opt for one of their free basic design options \u2014 or better yet, choose a different credit card entirely.\n\nAssuming you don't rack up any other fees and pay the first three fees listed above, this card will cost at least $170 in the first year and $147 after that.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip The Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card comes with a rewards program where cardholders earn 1% cash back on all eligible purchases, but be aware of the caveats: You earn rewards only when you pay your bill (weird); you can't access your rewards for the first six months (ugh); and there's a minimum redemption requirement.\n\n2. The interest rate is alarmingly high\n\nInterest rates on credit cards for consumers with bad credit are notoriously high, but the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card pushes the limit. As of this writing, the ongoing APR was almost 36%.\n\nThink of it this way: If you make minimum payments on a $1,000 credit card balance, you'll spend an additional $2,045 or so in interest with the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card. However, if you had that balance on a card charging a 29% annual percentage rate or APR and made the same monthly payment, you'd pay $963 in interest instead.\n\n3. A credit limit increase involves a wait and a possible cost\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nYou must carry the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card for a year before being considered for a credit limit increase, which is a long time to wait, considering you can become eligible for increases in less time with other cards. The Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card will consider you for a credit line increase in as little as six months.\n\nAnd let's go back to fees because you may have to pay another if your credit limit goes up with the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card. In this case, you could owe 25% of the amount your credit limit is increased. So, according to the card's terms and conditions, if your credit limit grows by $100, you may be on the hook for a $25 fee that eats into the increase. So, really, it'd be a credit limit increase of $75.\n\nSuch a fee is highly unusual, even among cards for bad credit.\n\n4. You must have a checking account\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nLike many cards for consumers with bad credit, you need a checking account to qualify. This can create a limitation for anyone who lacks a checking account but wants to establish a credit history.\n\nAn alternative is the OpenSky\u00ae Secured Visa\u00ae Credit Card, a secured card that allows you to pay a security deposit with a money order or Western Union transfer if you don't have a checking account. It does have a $35 annual fee, but that's cheaper than the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card, especially in the long run. (Another OpenSky product \u2014 the OpenSky\u00ae Plus Secured Visa\u00ae Credit Card \u2014 doesn't charge an annual fee, although it does require a higher security deposit.)\n\n5. Other cards cost much less\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nIf building credit is your goal, other credit cards designed for that purpose don't pile on a bunch of pricey fees.\n\nFirst, let's consider secured credit cards. Yes, they require you to put down an upfront deposit, which can be a hurdle. But unlike the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card, it's not a recurring amount you must pay every year, and you can eventually get that money back when you close the card in good standing. (The fees you pay on the Total Visa\u00ae Credit Card? Not refundable.).\n\nIn addition to lower fees, other secured cards also earn less gimmicky rewards.\n\nConsider the Capital One Quicksilver Secured Cash Rewards Credit Card, which has a $0 annual fee and earns 1.5% cash back on all purchases and 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card is another $0-annual-fee option that earns 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants (on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter) and 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThere's even a welcome bonus for new cardholders: INTRO OFFER: Unlimited Cashback Match \u2013 only from Discover. Discover will automatically match all the cash back you\u2019ve earned at the end of your first year! There\u2019s no minimum spending or maximum rewards. Just a dollar-for-dollar match.\n\nBoth cards also offer a path to graduating to unsecured cards over time.",

            "content": "CHICAGO (Feb. 11, 2025) \u2013 U.S. Women\u2019s National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named the 23-player roster for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup, presented by Visa, taking place in Houston (Feb. 20), Glendale, Ariz. (Feb. 23) and San Diego (Feb. 26).\n\nThe U.S. roster features 21 field players and two goalkeepers. This tournament will be the 10th annual SheBelieves Cup, and the USA has won the past five editions. The first SheBelieves Cup for Hayes and for 10 players on the roster.\n\n\u201cThis team is still growing, and I continue to be impressed with the dedication of our player pool to get better, individually and as a group,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cWith many players at the beginning of their club preseasons, we\u2019ll be patient with them but at the same time, we\u2019re going to maximize the time we have together. We are facing three excellent teams with three very different styles and the tournament will be a great test to see who can perform against world-class players, but to see that, we need to give them opportunities. We have put in a lot of thought on how best to accomplish that while continuing to evolve and putting out a team that can win, so every game should be a lot of fun for the staff, the players and the fans.\u201d\n\nU.S. Women\u2019s National Team Roster by Position (Club; Caps/Goals) \u2013 2025 SheBelieves Cup\n\nGOALKEEPERS (2): Jane Campbell (Houston Dash; 8), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 1)\n\nDEFENDERS (8): Tierna Davidson (NJ/NY Gotham FC; 65/3), Crystal Dunn (Paris Saint-Germain, FRA; 155/25), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 62/1), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 0/0), Jenna Nighswonger (Arsenal FC, ENG; 18/2), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 2/0), Emily Sonnett (NJ/NY Gotham FC; 103/2), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; 0/0)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (6): Korbin Albert (Paris Saint-Germain, FRA; 22/1), Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 28/1), Lindsey Heaps (Olympique Lyon, FRA; 161/36), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 0/0), Jaedyn Shaw (North Carolina Courage; 21/8), Lily Yohannes (Ajax, NED; 2/1)\n\nFORWARDS (7): Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle Reign FC; 75/21), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 0/0), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 19/8), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 4/0), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville FC; 3/1), Ally Sentnor (Utah Royals; 2/0), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City FC; 13/1)\n\nTwo players \u2013 Lindsey Heaps (formerly Horan) and Lynn Biyendolo (formerly Williams) -- will play for the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team under their married names for the first time.\n\nHouston Dash goalkeeper Jane Campbell and newly acquired forward Yazmeen Ryan will get the chance to play in their home venue at Shell Energy Stadium where the USA will open the tournament. Two of Campbell\u2019s eight caps have come at the venue.\n\nThe roster includes 12 players from the 22-player squad that won the 2024 Paris Olympics but just four players who started five or more games in the tournament, so the theme of increased opportunity for the player pool once again will be at the forefront during the three SheBelieves Cup matches.\n\nHayes called up four uncapped players \u2013 all of whom have played in a FIFA Youth World Cup \u2013 and 10 players (43% of the roster) who have four or fewer caps. Veterans and 2024 Olympic gold medalists Lindsey Heaps (161 caps/36 goals), Crystal Dunn (155/25), Emily Sonnett (103/2), Lynn Biyendolo (75/21) and Tierna Davidson (65/3) lead the way.\n\nSonnett, who earned her 100th cap on Oct. 24, 2024, against Iceland in Austin, Texas, will be honored for the achievement prior the opening match of the tournament on Feb. 20 vs. Colombia at Shell Energy Stadium in Houston. She is the 45th USWNT player to reach that milestone.\n\nThe roster includes 16 players from the National Women\u2019s Soccer League and seven from five different European clubs. The players on the roster from Arsenal FC (Emily Fox, Jenna Nighswonger), Chelsea FC (Catarina Macario) and Olympique Lyon (Heaps) will all be playing in the quarterfinals of the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League in March.\n\nThe camp also marks the first-ever senior USWNT call-ups for 19-year-old midfielder Claire Hutton and 22-year-old forward Michelle Cooper, who are teammates on the Kansas City Current.\n\nThe roster includes 12 players from the USA\u2019s January training camp in Florida and three \u2013 Hutton, Cooper and defender Gisele Thompson \u2013 who attended the concurrent Futures Camp and showed well enough to earn these senior team call-ups.\n\nGisele Thompson\u2019s inclusion on the roster along with her older sister Alyssa marks just the third time that a pair of sisters have been on the same USWNT roster. The first instance occurred in the late 1990s when twins Lorrie and Ronnie Fair were called up together. Most recently, Samantha and Kristie Mewis were on the 2021 Olympic Team together. This is Gisele Thompson\u2019s second USWNT call-up after training with the team in June of 2024.\n\nSHEBELIEVES: INSPIRING THE NEXT GENERATION\n\nInspired by the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team, SheBelieves is a movement to encourage young women and girls to reach their dreams, athletic or otherwise. The campaign was originally launched in the run-up to the 2015 Women\u2019s World Cup and has evolved into a special bond between U.S. Soccer and its fans, taking a meaningful message of empowerment and that of believing in yourself into communities across the nation.\n\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\n\nThe world\u2019s top-ranked U.S. Women\u2019s National Team will host Japan (#8 in the current FIFA Women\u2019s World Rankings), Australia (#15) and Colombia (#21) as the competition returns to its traditional six-game, three matchday format after being played in a four-game, two-date format last year due to the new FIFA windows in years that feature the Olympic Games.\n\nThe winner of the tournament will once again be determined by total points (three for a win, one for a tie), with the first tiebreaker being overall goal difference, followed by most goals scored, then head-to-head result and lastly, Fair Play ranking if necessary.\n\nAll four teams in the 2025 SheBelieves Cup field were in the women's tournament at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 with the USA defeating Australia (2-1) in group play and Japan (1-0) in an extra time thriller in the quarterfinal match. Australia and Colombia will make their first appearances in the SheBelieves Cup, while Japan returns to the field for the third consecutive year and the fifth time overall. The USA has won the last five SheBelieves Cups and has seven titles overall, while France won in 2017 and England took top honors in 2019.\n\nAll the U.S. matches will be broadcast on TBS and Universo and streamed on Max and Peacock. All non-U.S. games will also be available on Max and in Spanish on Universo and Peacock.\n\nThe schedule will see the USA open the tournament against Colombia on Thursday, Feb. 20 at Shell Energy Stadium in Houston (7 p.m. CT / 8 p.m. ET on TBS, Max and in Spanish on Universo and Peacock) while Japan faces Australia at 4 p.m. CT / 5 p.m. ET (Max, Universo and Peacock). The teams will then move to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where the USA faces Australia on Feb. 23 at 3 p.m. MT / 5 p.m. ET (TBS, Max and in Spanish on Universo and Peacock) and Colombia takes on Japan at Noon MT / 2 p.m. ET (Max, Universo and Peacock). The final two games will take place at Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego on Feb. 26 with the USA facing Japan at 7:30 p.m. PT / 10:30 p.m. ET (TBS, Max and in Spanish on Universo and Peacock) and Australia taking on Colombia at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET (Max, Universo and Peacock).\n\nVISA SHEBELIEVES CUP MVP\n\nFor the sixth year in a row, Visa, the presenting sponsor of the SheBelieves Cup, will award the MVP trophy to the most outstanding player of the tournament. The award will be announced following the conclusion of the final match on Feb. 26 and with the input of a selection committee comprised of representatives from the four competing nations.\n\nFor the fifth year in a row, fans will also get the opportunity to vote for the Visa SheBelieves Cup MVP award using an online ballot to select among a list of finalists chosen by the committee. The fan vote will be incorporated into the overall determination of the 2025 Visa SheBelieves Cup MVP.\n\nSpain attacker Alexia Putellas won the inaugural award in 2020 while the USA\u2019s Rose Lavelle collected the honors in 2021. Macario took home top honors in 2022 followed by Mallory Swanson in 2023 and Sophia Smith (now Sophia Wilson) in 2024.\n\nAdditional Notes",

Please enjoy the podcast.\n\nMeagan Dziura: Welcome to another immigration episode of the Ogletree Deakins podcast. I\u2019m Meagan Dziura. I\u2019m a senior attorney in Ogletree\u2019s, Raleigh, North Carolina office. My guest today is shareholder, Kara Lancaster. Kara is also in the Raleigh office that we work with different clients in mostly different industries, which is why I wanted her perspective on our topic today. Thank you so much for joining me, Kara.\n\nKara Lancaster: Yeah, hi. Thanks for having me.\n\nMeagan Dziura: So, some of you may have seen the title of this episode and clicked on it and have been like, we\u2019re still reeling from an election that may have huge impacts on immigration. So, can we get a breather? Why are we already talking about CAP? It doesn\u2019t start until next year, and the answer is no because we have to prep for the CAP already, and clients are already contacting us to prep for the H-1B lottery, and that\u2019s why we wanted to talk about it today. During this episode, we\u2019ll be talking about how you can best prepare your company for the fiscal year 2026 H-1B lottery and updates made by USCIS from last year. Before we get into that, we did have a big news update from USCIS from December. So, USCIS announced on December 2nd that the fiscal year 2025 selections were officially finished, which it\u2019s shocking that it took this long because the selections were initially announced in April.\n\nSo, USCIS has confirmed they\u2019ve filled all of their H-1B slots, meaning there will not be a third round of selections for fiscal year 2025, meaning that if you have employees that were not selected in the 2025 lottery, you should definitely consider putting them in for this next lottery starting in March 2025. So, before we get into the timing of the lottery, why companies should consider the lottery, and which employees they should consider putting in the H-1B lottery. Let\u2019s just quickly run over the basics of the H-1B. So, what is the H-1B, and Kara, why is it such a popular visa for employers?\n\nKara Lancaster: Yeah, so to start really basic, the H-1B visa is known as the specialty occupation visa. So, what that means is that it\u2019s a position that requires at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a specific specialty. When we talk about the lottery, we\u2019re talking about brand new H-1Bs, so not individuals who already have had an H-1B in the past. This is somebody that\u2019s going into the lottery for the first time to get their first H-1B, and, essentially, this is a visa that\u2019s really beneficial for a couple of reasons. One reason is that it provides for immigrant intent. So that means the ability to have an intention to stay in the United States permanently. And sometimes you\u2019ll hear that referred to as dual intent. So, you could plan on using the H-1B temporarily, or you could plan on using the H-1B to ultimately pursue a green card. And so, there are some visas including F-I students, and some other work visas that do not allow that intent to remain permanently.\n\nAnd so, switching over to the H-1B is a good step towards reaching permanent residency if that\u2019s the end goal. The other reason the H-1B is really beneficial is because although it has sort of a baseline six-year limit, it\u2019s the only visa that can be extended beyond its sort of quote-unquote \u201climit\u201d if an individual has reached certain milestones in the green card process. And so, unlike the L-1 visa that has a very hard five- and seven-year limit, and unlike some of the work authorization options for students that also have very hard limits, the H-1B can be something that is extremely flexible from a long-term planning perspective if you are lucky enough to be selected in the lottery. And so, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re seeing has become more and more important in light of a lot of the backlogs for green cards that we are seeing where some of these other visa types are just not providing enough time. They\u2019re not providing enough time for somebody to stay in the U.S. and get their green card. And so, the H-1B visa really provides that flexibility and the ability to continue to extend your stay in the U.S. while pursuing that permanent residence.\n\nMeagan Dziura: So, why do we even have this annual lottery? So, to back up several years, Congress allocated only a specific number of H-1B visas, and that number has not gone up despite more and more foreign nationals wanting to come to the U.S. and also companies needing foreign nationals skilled workers, skilled professional workers, to come to the U.S., Congress has not increased the number of H-1B visas that can be used each year. New visas, as Kara said. So, there are only 65,000 visas allocated to people who have a bachelor\u2019s degree and who are applying for the H-1B visa. Then, there are 20,000 additional H-1Bs that are allocated for people who got a U.S. master\u2019s degree, so not the equivalent of a U.S. master\u2019s degree, but went to a U.S. institution to get a master\u2019s degree. We call that the master\u2019s cap.\n\nSo, in total, there are only 85,000 H-1Bs each year, and we\u2019ll kind of go over the numbers later, but in the hundreds of thousands are how many people register for the H-1B each year. So, they\u2019re just frankly not enough, which is why they started the H-1B lottery.\n\nSo, when does the H-1B lottery start? The registration period dates, they\u2019re not announced yet, but last year, registration was March 6, 2024 until March 22, 2024. And there\u2019s no difference if you register on that first date they announce it or the last date. USCIS does not start their selections until the lottery registration actually closes. So, companies have about a two-week period to register all of their CAP candidates. Then, usually, USCIS will announce that they\u2019ve finished their automated computerized lottery selection. Typically, it\u2019s done before April 1st, and then the filing period will open. And that\u2019s also usually between April and the end of June. So, next year, it\u2019ll be June 2025. Again, they haven\u2019t announced these dates yet. Typically, they\u2019re announced in the beginning of the CAP year. So, in the beginning of 2025, we should know that, and that\u2019s when we will start helping companies actually register in the USCIS system.\n\nSo, what are some updates in the past few years to the H-1B lottery? So, they started doing the online registration a few years ago, and originally, it was only $10 per registration, so per candidate that a company is registering. They have now increased the fee to $215 per registrant, which it still doesn\u2019t sound that much, but it is a huge increase. So, this can definitely add up for some of these companies that are registering thousands of CAP candidates each year. And there are companies that register that many.\n\nKara, do you think this increase in fees will have a cooling effect on the number of candidates we see in total for this upcoming lottery?\n\nKara Lancaster: It may have a slight impact. I don\u2019t know that it will be a major impact. Some of the larger companies that tend to put the most individuals into the lottery, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to change their strategy in terms of the volume of employees they are registering. I think they will just kind of absorb that additional cost for the most part. I think we may see smaller companies, small to midsize companies, maybe consider putting a smaller group of individuals into the lottery, perhaps just the people that are critical, right?\n\nMeagan Dziura: Right.\n\nKara Lancaster: That really, really need the H-1B. And so, we might see a decrease in the number of registrants from those companies, but they don\u2019t make up the large majority of the registrants, right?\n\nMeagan Dziura: Right.\n\nKara Lancaster: So, I think overall, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a huge impact from this fee increase.\n\nMeagan Dziura: Yeah, I tend to agree, and this is on top of\u2026 This fee increase is on top of USCIS actually raised their fees for overall. So, I think companies have already been sort of trying to absorb the new cost. The like H-1B fee has gone up, premium processing fee went up, each H-1B now has an asylum fee that they have to pay. So, I think the $215 is pretty small compared to the actual H-1B fees that will be much higher, but those aren\u2019t paid unless someone\u2019s selected. This is just to register with USCIS. It doesn\u2019t tie into the actual selection or the actual filing of the H-1B for selected people.\n\nThe other update, this was new last year, but it\u2019s worth going over because it did make a huge impact. So, there was a lot of suspected misuse of the registration process because there\u2019s no limit to the number of times a candidate can be inputted into the registration.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a number of times the candidate can be put in the registration by one employer. So, one employer cannot put a candidate in multiple times. However, that candidate can have multiple employers put them into the lottery, and that\u2019s not considered fraudulent or a misuse of the system as long as there are real employers who really intend to hire this candidate or sponsor this candidate for an H-1B if they\u2019re already employed there. However, there were a lot of suspicions raised that companies were potentially misusing this by creating subsidiaries, or there could have been fraudulent companies misusing this that weren\u2019t true companies, and employees were being put into the lottery when there was no actual intention to hire them, they would just file an H-1B for them, and then the employee would go and find real employment.\n\nSo, there was a lot of talk about this with USCIS, and they decided to change the way they were selecting CAP candidates. So, instead of using the individual selections where a candidate could be selected, if they had, we heard stories of 40 companies putting in one candidate, then that candidate could potentially be selected by multiple times using different registrants from the company. A beneficiary could take several spots that other candidates could have used. So now, each beneficiary, you\u2019re required to put in their passport number; you can\u2019t skip it. And so, each beneficiary can only be selected once. So even if a beneficiary put in say three, was put in three times, they can only get selected one time for one employer. So, hopefully, this cut down on the suspicions of fraud. Again, a beneficiary can still be put in multiple times from different companies, so that doesn\u2019t go away. It\u2019s just that the beneficiary themselves can only be selected once. And now that USCIS has announced that the CAP is officially closed for 2025 or the for fiscal year 2025, it does look like this worked.\n\nIn 2024, USCIS received around 408,000 registrations for beneficiaries that had multiple eligible registrations and then that were deemed real registrations. And in 2025, fiscal year 2025, USCIS only received 47,000 registrations for beneficiaries for multiple eligible registrations. So that\u2019s a huge drop, which is good news for basically all companies because it means their candidates have a more fair way of being selected. So, hopefully, that will continue. USCIS hasn\u2019t confirmed that they\u2019re using that same selection process, but I think we can assume that they would be using it again just because it seems it was so successful on combating these suspicions of fraud.\n\nSo, like I said in the beginning of the episode, this does feel early to start talking about CAP prep, especially when USCIS has just announced that the fiscal year 2025 CAP is over. However, planning has already started for the majority of our clients at Ogletree. Kara, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about what have your clients already been doing for CAP planning?\n\nKara Lancaster: Yeah, so on our side, we\u2019ve already started, especially for large clients, we\u2019ve already started getting them kind of these big lists of their employee populations in terms of who\u2019s eligible. And a lot of times these lists are just anybody who doesn\u2019t already have an H-1B, so that\u2019s individuals on L-1 visas, TN visas, E-3, visas, and certainly the F-1 students. And so, right now, clients are kind of taking that information, taking those lists, and kind of going back to the different business units within their organization to get that buy-in to explain to managers and HR, here\u2019s who we recommend putting into the lottery. And just having those internal discussions to then ultimately be able to come back to us and let us know sort of here\u2019s the final list, here\u2019s everybody that we\u2019re going to register. And so again, for those large clients, it\u2019s a big undertaking when you have hundreds and hundreds of employees that are eligible to go into this lottery. So, we\u2019re kind of in that phase of clients doing that internal piece first. And so, usually, once we get into the new year is when we\u2019ll be able to start really ramping up contacting those employees and sort of preparing for the actual registration period.\n\nMeagan Dziura: And that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing too with the bigger clients, even some small one-off clients that I have that may only register one or two potentially student people on student visas, even they have been reaching out just to say, \u201cHey, can we make sure that this job that we want to sponsor someone in, make sure it\u2019s actually eligible for the H-1B?\u201d So, it\u2019s a bit of combination of both getting that list together and confirming, of course, costs with businesses if it\u2019s a large company and confirming just who companies need to sponsor. And I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the timeline. Again, the exact dates haven\u2019t been announced yet. Those are usually announced in the beginning of the year. So right now, as Kara said, we\u2019re kind of reviewing information, confirming eligibility for people, working with companies to make sure they have their lists together. Just a pro-tip for all people who may be going into the CAP, you should have renewed passports because we do need the passport numbers.\n\nSo, if you have employees who you want to put into the CAP, a great idea to tell everyone to renew their passports in early March 2025, that\u2019s generally when we would be registering the H-1B candidates. Usually that\u2019s around March, I would say between 6th and 9th is when the registration opens, usually no later than April 1st or USCIS confirms the selected registrations, and that\u2019s when it\u2019s our office\u2019s job to go and notify the company who is selected in the H-1B lottery. And then the filing period opens, and again, that\u2019s usually around April 1st or early April through June 30th. It\u2019s a 90-day filing window. And then, USCIS may during that time say, \u201cHey, we have more visas available.\u201d They may announce a second round, or they may wait until we see how many actual filings they get out of the number of people that are registered. Because like I said, beneficiaries can be registered multiple times, even if they can only be selected once. And an employer may decide not to file an H-1B for someone, even if they\u2019re selected, there\u2019s no requirement that they file that H-1B and use that slot. So, USCIS may have more open slots after they see how many people actually filed for H-1Bs.\n\nKara Lancaster: Thank you for being with us today.

The EB-2 and EB-3 Final Action Dates for India will move forward by six weeks. Meanwhile, EB-1 and EB-5 categories will remain unchanged.For EB-2 applicants from India, the Final Action Date will progress to December 1, 2012. EB-3 Professionals and Skilled Workers from India will see their Final Action Date move to February 1, 2013. The EB-3 Other Workers category will also advance by six weeks, reaching the same date.USCIS has confirmed that in March, it will accept employment-based adjustment of status applications from individuals with a priority date earlier than the listed Final Action Dates.Additionally, the EB-4 category will retrogress by nearly a year and a half, setting the new Final Action Date at August 1, 2019. The State Department has cautioned that this category may become \u201cUnavailable\u201d in the coming months.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)The Certain Religious Workers (SR) Program is set to expire on March 14, 2025. If not extended, the category will become unavailable, and no visas will be issued beyond March 13, 2025. If extended, the Final Action Date for the category will remain August 1, 2019, through the end of March.USCIS has announced that in March, it will accept employment-based adjustment of status applications based on the Visa Bulletin Final Action Dates chart. Foreign nationals applying for an adjustment of status must have a priority date earlier than the listed Final Action Date for their respective preference category and country.Understanding the Visa Bulletin is crucial for individuals seeking Green Cards, as it provides vital information about the timeline for adjusting immigration status and eligibility based on application submission. The bulletin acts as a guide for the Green Card journey, featuring two essential sections.Dates for Filing: This section specifies the earliest date applicants can submit their adjustment of status or immigrant visa applications. It helps applicants determine when they can proceed with their filing based on their visa category and country of origin.Final Action Dates: These dates estimate the wait time for application approval, leading to permanent residency. They function as a queue based on visa category and nationality, indicating when applicants can expect their applications to be processed.However, there's a crucial caveat for employment-based green card (EB) adjustments. To file in August 2024, applicants must have an application date preceding a specific date listed for their category and country in the bulletin, ensuring their eligibility for filing.The significance of final action dates lies in their role in application processing. These dates vary depending on the visa type and nationality, directly impacting the duration of the green card application process and potential wait times. Understanding and monitoring these dates is essential for individuals navigating the Green Card application process.The Visa Bulletin outlines preference categories for family-sponsored immigrants, providing critical information for navigating the Green Card process. The categories are as follows:The bulletin provides detailed insights into the allocation of immigrant visas, primarily based on priority dates and demand received by April 1st of each fiscal year. When demand surpasses the available visas in a particular category or country, that category is classified as oversubscribed. In such cases, the final action date for oversubscribed categories is determined by the priority date of the first applicant who couldn't be accommodated within the numerical limits.For the fiscal year 2024, the limit for family-sponsored preference immigrants is set at 226,000, with specific allocations for each preference category. Additionally, there are per-country limits set at 7% of the total annual family-sponsored and employment-based preference limits. Immigrant visas are issued in order of priority based on the filing date of the petition.Spouses and children of preference immigrants are entitled to the same status and consideration as the principal applicant. In instances where visa issuances surpass the per-country limit, visa prorating provisions come into effect for oversubscribed chargeability areas, including China (mainland born), India, Mexico, and the Philippines. These provisions ensure fair allocation of visas among applicants from different countries.Understanding these intricacies is crucial for individuals navigating the immigrant visa process. The Visa Bulletin serves as a vital tool, providing essential information about visa availability and processing times, helping applicants plan their immigration journey effectively.The allocation of immigrant visas in the employment-based preference categories is structured to ensure a balanced distribution among various types of skilled and unskilled workers, professionals, and investors. Understanding these categories and their allocation percentages is crucial for individuals seeking employment-based immigrant visas.1. Priority Workers: This category receives 28.6% of the global employment-based preference level. It includes:Additionally, any surplus numbers not used for the fourth and fifth preferences may also be allocated here.2. Members of the Professions Holding Advanced Degrees or Individuals of Exceptional Ability: This category is also allotted 28.6% of the global employment-based preference level, plus any numbers not required by the first preference. It covers:3. Skilled Workers, Professionals, and Other Workers: This category receives 28.6% of the worldwide level, along with any numbers not required by the first and second preferences. It includes:4. Certain Special Immigrants: This category is allocated 7.1% of the global level and includes:5. Employment Creation: This category also receives 7.1% of the global level. It is further divided to ensure targeted investment and job creation:These employment-based preference categories are designed to attract a diverse pool of talented individuals to the United States, fostering economic growth and innovation. By understanding these allocation percentages and categories, applicants can better navigate the U.S. immigration system and plan their visa applications accordingly.",

John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, said the bill, House File 115, came about in response to protests against Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, and Israel's military response in Gaza.\n\n\"I\u2019d say that that's the main purpose of this bill is if you're not a citizen of the United States, you're here at the grace of the United States, but yet supporting against the interests of the United States, then why should you be here?\" he said. \"Why should you stay?\"\n\nRep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, declined to support the bill, calling it \"not ready for prime time.\"\n\n\"If someone is inciting a riot, if someone is inciting threats to our country or citizens or any visitors that we have in our country, they contact law enforcement,\" he said. \"They can contact the FBI currently.\"\n\nA three-member House subcommittee voted 2-1 on Tuesday to advance the bill to the full Higher Education Committee for consideration. Wills and Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Birmingham, were in support and Wilburn was opposed.\n\nWhat does the bill do?\n\nThe bill, which lawmakers named the \"Combatting Terrorist Sympathizers Act,\" would apply to \"nonimmigrant visas,\" which include, among others, F-1 and M-1 student visas and the J-1 visa, which allows the holder to work in various jobs in the United States, including as a teacher.\n\nThe legislation directs Iowa's public and private colleges and universities to adopt a policies that prohibit students, faculty and staff who hold a visa \"from publicly espousing terrorist activity related to an ongoing conflict or, at any time or place, persuading others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity related to an ongoing conflict or to support a terrorist organization unless it is the policy or practice of the United States to support such activity or organization.\"\n\nThe bill uses the definitions of \"terrorist activity\" and \"terrorist organization\" found in federal law.\n\nA first offense would result in a minimum one-year suspension for a student or termination of a faculty or staff member's employment for at least a year.\n\nA second offense would require the student or employee to be expelled or fired permanently.\n\nThe bill would also prevent a student or faculty or staff member to transfer to or get a job at a school if they have already been suspended by another school under the bill.\n\nThe Iowa attorney general's office would have the power to enforce the law, including by issuing subpoenas and bringing an action in court to compel the college or university to follow the law.\n\nA college or university that violates the law would be ineligible to receive funds issued by the Iowa Tuition Grant.\n\nThe bill would take effect Dec. 31.\n\nWhat are people saying about the bill?\n\nWilburn said he has concerns about the bill, including the definition of \"espousing\" terrorism.\n\n\"If I happen to be listening to someone speak and I'm nodding my head and someone has a concern, you know, am I now a terrorist?\" he said.\n\nShipley said he has questions about the bill, but is comfortable moving it forward for further discussion.\n\n\"I think when you have people who are advocating violence or sympathizing with violence, I think that is deplorable and puts a lot of stress on our free society,\" he said. \"Especially if you include political figures, CEOs and anything else that we've been seeing.\"\n\nOnly one member of the public spoke at Tuesday's subcommittee, which was held at 7:30 a.m.\n\nJillian Carlson, a lobbyist for the Iowa Board of Regents, said they're undecided on the bill but suggested to lawmakers that they remove the \"any time and place\" language from the bill to more narrowly tailor it.\n\n\"We would suggest narrowing that down to things that occur on campus, or using campus resources,\" she said. \"Saying 'any time or place' is very broad and all-encompassing. And in order to enforce this bill, narrowing the focus would significantly help us.\"\n\nWills said he would be interested in taking a look at the proposed amendment, but did not commit to adopting it.\n\n(This story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.)\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

These actions were far-reaching, with potential impacts for employers and sponsored employees across the United States. This article discusses several of the actions that may have the most impact on employers, including updates on visa screening, potential travel restrictions, the sunset of temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezuela, and increased enforcement in sensitive locations, which include hospitals and universities.\n\nQuick Hits\n\nVisa Issuance Review: Several orders have the potential to impact trade visa issuance, visa screening procedures, and the potential for limitations on admission to the United States.\n\nSeveral orders have the potential to impact trade visa issuance, visa screening procedures, and the potential for limitations on admission to the United States. Sunset of TPS for Venezuela: Executive agencies are charged with reviewing humanitarian status programs, resulting in the first termination of temporary protected status programs.\n\nExecutive agencies are charged with reviewing humanitarian status programs, resulting in the first termination of temporary protected status programs. Increased Enforcement: DHS rescinded a long-standing policy on conducting enforcement actions in sensitive locations, and President Trump issued an executive order that may impact universities with foreign students.\n\nReview of Trade Agreements, Visa Issuance Procedures, and Potential for Travel Bans\n\nThe \u201cAmerica First Trade Policy\u201d revisits and reviews the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), as well as other existing U.S. trade agreements in consultation with other executive departments and agencies.\n\nThe outcome of this review has the potential to impact trade visa categories, including TN, E-1, E-2, E-3, and H-1B1 visas.\n\nThe \u201cProtecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats\u201d executive order charges executive agencies, including the U.S. Department of State, with reviewing visa application vetting procedures. Agencies need to make a recommendation within the next sixty days if certain countries and their citizens require enhanced vetting or a full suspension of admission to the United States.\n\nThis order has the potential to increase visa processing times and may result in a partial or full suspension of entry for citizens from certain countries.\n\nHumanitarian Programs Under Review\n\nLast week, the 2023 TPS designation for Venezuela was officially terminated, sunsetting that program as of April 7, 2025. This was the most recent humanitarian program to come under review. The administration also suspended U.S. participation in the refugee admissions program for the next ninety days under the \u201cRealigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program\u201d executive order. All humanitarian parole and temporary protected status designations have been ordered to be reviewed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pursuant to the \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion\u201d executive order.\n\nTPS and other humanitarian parole programs account for over a million individuals in the United States, and a sunset of work authorizations in these categories may have impacts across the U.S. labor market.\n\nImmigration Enforcement Expanded\n\nImmigration enforcement was a central element of the incoming administration\u2019s policy platform, and the first three weeks saw numerous executive orders relating enforcement actions.\n\nDHS revoked a long-standing policy limiting enforcement actions at sensitive locations, which included schools, medical facilities, places of worship, social services establishments, children\u2019s gathering places (playgrounds and childcare centers), places for disaster or emergency response and relief, wedding and/or funeral sites, and public demonstrations (parades, marches, demonstrations, and rallies).\n\nWith the rescission of the prior sensitive areas policy, enforcement actions may now be conducted in locations that had previously not experienced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity. ICE officers can conduct enforcement actions\u2014which include arrests, interviews, searches, and surveillance\u2014in sensitive areas without requiring authorization from senior DHS officials.\n\nICE officers are encouraged to use discretion, \u201calong with a healthy dose of common sense\u201d when conducting arrests, searches, and interviews in these locations.\n\nOn January 29, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order that affirms the administration will \u201cus[e] all available and appropriate legal tools\u201d to combat antisemitism, especially at higher education institutions. The order requests federal agencies to submit reports \u201c[w]ithin 60 days of the date of [the] order\u201d that include, among other data, inventory of all pending administrative complaints, complaints under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and court cases against universities alleging civil rights violations relating to antisemitic activities on campus.\n\nThe order also directs agencies to recommend ways to educate higher education institutions on the grounds for inadmissibility, enabling such institutions to monitor, report, and investigate relevant activities by foreign national students, faculty, and staff, potentially leading to their removal.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nExecutive orders impacting foreign national workers in the United States have created uncertainty for employers and employees. Given the stated policy platform of the administration, employers can expect additional policy changes in the coming weeks.\n\nKristen M. Tully also contributed to this article.",

There is a real risk that backlash over perceived unfairness or mistreatment of Indian citizens will undermine popular support for the United States and pressure Prime Minister Modi to reduce cooperation on trade and other areas of U.S. and bilateral interest.\n\nThe upcoming meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump provides an important opportunity to help turn potential conflicts over immigration into a proactive agenda that benefits both sides.\n\nH-1B Guest Worker Visas\n\nThe success of the 5-million-strong Indian American community (\u201cNon-Resident Indians,\u201d or NRIs in Indian parlance), the nation\u2019s best-educated and wealthiest minority group, is a point of pride for Indians back home. While not formally an immigrant visa, H-1B holders working in specialty occupations are allowed to convert to immigrant status over time. Given that Indians have received as many as 75 percent of H-1Bs annually since the program\u2019s 1990 start, these visas are part of the origin story behind the success of many if not most NRI families. As do the companies that sponsor H-1B applicants, most Indians argue that H-1B visas fill a critical gap in STEM talent otherwise missing from the U.S. labor pool. They are not convinced by detractors who view the visas as a back door for employers to replace qualified high-skilled U.S. workers with lower-cost foreign counterparts, despite evidence that this has happened in at least some cases. Not surprisingly, reports that President Trump might eliminate or limit the program have garnered a lot of attention in Indian media and have already ruffled feathers. However, the Trump administration is not of one mind on H-1Bs and any changes to the program will take time to evolve.\n\nAn Even Greater Controversy Ahead: Undocumented Indians\n\nAlthough until recently H-1Bs have grabbed most of the media attention, Indians will likely also be disproportionately impacted by the Trump administration\u2019s pledge to deport all undocumented aliens. Deportations have already been on the agenda of the recent phone call between the prime minister and president as well as Secretary of State Rubio and Foreign Minister Jaishankar, who noted India\u2019s commitment to legal immigration only and to repatriating some 20,000 undocumented Indians identified by the Trump administration. The removal has already begun on a relatively small scale, and India\u2019s opposition has already criticized the treatment of the deportees. Not surprisingly, Indian media reports that Modi will raise this issue during his meeting with the president.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that the opposition has stressed that any Indians to immigrate to the United States should do so legally; they have so far protested the fact that deportees were shackled, not the removals themselves. However, total estimates of undocumented Indians currently in the United States range as high as 725,000, which is 40 times the number already discussed by Washington and Delhi and 1,000 times the total number deported in the last 15 years. The significantly higher pace and numbers of deportations that will likely take place in the coming months are likely to create increasing controversy in India as well as among NRIs, particularly as some deportees may claim unfair treatment or personal hardship. Adding possible fuel to the fire, a large share of undocumented Indians hail from Gujarat\u2014Prime Minister Modi\u2019s home state\u2014and Punjab, the state that finds itself in the middle of the Khalistan controversy, further increasing the public political pressure that the deportations may place on Modi\u2019s government.\n\nOpportunities to Find Commonality\n\nIf not handled correctly, debates over visas and illegal immigration may also pit Prime Minister Modi\u2019s base against President Trump\u2019s, reducing the flexibility of either leader to respond to the other\u2019s concerns. Both leaders should act now to avoid the potential for dispute and gridlock.\n\nDespite the high media attention, there is time to accommodate both side\u2019s interests in the H-1B program. Unlike the case with trade, India will have little voice in how U.S. policy changes will be made and implemented, even if U.S.-based Indian companies are among the largest users of the program. The program is not likely to go away any time soon, and many of the options on the table\u2014such as lifting minimum salary requirements for H-1B workers, should be welcomed by those Indians who get the visas. Reiterated support by Modi and other senior Indian officials for enforcement of existing rules, including by Indian companies in the United States, could also ease potential tensions.\n\nIn months ahead, the Trump administration\u2019s desire to prioritize AI development, a possible topic of discussion at this week\u2019s meeting, may also result in a larger pie for IT and other skilled tech workers, reducing the U.S. impetus to limit the H-1B program. Continued efforts to connect both countries\u2019 talents in critical and emerging technologies, which are likely to remain a priority for both leaders, will offer the possibility for other accommodations. These might include prioritizing H-1B and O visas in strategic sectors such as AI and critical minerals, and the development of joint degree programs in these areas by U.S. and Indian educational institutions, perhaps tied to Fulbright-Nehru scholarships. The result could be an increased pool of talent familiar with both countries\u2019 innovation ecosystems.\n\nAddress the Most Urgent Problem First\n\nAs the removal of undocumented Indians has already begun, this is likely (and appropriately) to be the focus of the prime minister\u2019s and president\u2019s discussions next week. Among other steps they should consider is a joint effort to combat the trafficking networks that prey on Indian citizens wishing to travel illegally to the United States, the consequences of which can be deadly. Minister Jaishankar has already raised the need to address trafficking, and this could be a very productive joint effort. Both countries should also work together (including through the U.S. embassy and consulates in India) on public service campaigns that highlight the risks to Indians of illegal immigration and the increasing likelihood that those who do enter the United States illegally will be deported.\n\nBoth leaders should also announce their intention to prioritize the opening of new visa-issuing operations at the recently opened U.S. consulate in Bangalore and the previously announced consulate in Ahmedabad. This may go against both sides\u2019 instincts\u2014President Trump is pledging to slash the budget and government workforce. And the Indian government tends to be wary of agreeing to an increased footprint of the already large U.S. diplomatic presence. Reasons for illegal migration vary, but the current increase in Indians illegally entering the United States is directly correlated to the increase in visa wait times at U.S. consular offices in India. Consulates also play a key role in identifying and shutting down the criminal rings that traffic undocumented immigrants and false documentation for visa applicants.\n\nDon\u2019t Be Lulled\n\nThe growth of U.S.-India ties has been so successful that it is hard to recall that just several years ago, relatively siloed issues could spill over and disrupt our broader cooperation. Working proactively to address immigration and visa issues will help both sides stay on track in working through trade and other potential areas of difference in the months ahead.\n\nKatherine B.

            "content": "Here's a look at the two payment processing companies and which stock is better for dividend investors.\n\nMastercard (MA 1.50%) and Visa (V 0.99%) are incredibly similar payment processing companies with comparable product offerings and overlapping customers. As investments, both stocks have reliable track records and grow their dividends consistently, making them solid choices for investors seeking steady income with minimal risk.\n\nBut which one is the better buy right now? While they may seem almost identical, differences in financials, capital allocation strategies, and stock valuations could tip the scales. Let's take a closer look to see which one stands out today.\n\nHere are the recent financial results for Mastercard and Visa\n\nBefore digging into the financials of these two payment giants, it's important to note that Visa has a higher market capitalization at $674 billion compared to Mastercard's $519 billion, meaning it is the larger of the two companies and will have higher overall. Mastercard and Visa recently reported their December 2024 quarterly results, so let's look at their top and bottom lines to get a sense of each company's recent growth.\n\nDuring fourth-quarter 2024, Mastercard generated $7.5 billion in net revenue, translating to net income of $3.3 billion. These figures represent year-over-year growth of 14% and 20%, respectively. In comparison, Visa generated $9.5 billion in net revenue and $5.1 billion in net income for the fiscal first quarter, equating to year-over-year growth of 5%.\n\nWhile Mastercard is currently outpacing Visa in growth, Visa maintains a critical advantage -- its operating margin remains an industry-leading 66%, compared to Mastercard's 56.3%. Operating margin is a key metric because it demonstrates a company's ability to generate operating profit after accounting for operating expenses and the cost of goods sold.\n\nCompany Net Revenue (YoY Growth) Operating Margin Net Income (YoY Growth) Market Capitalization Mastercard $7.5 billion (14%) 56.3% $3.3 billion (20%) $519 billion Visa $9.5 billion (10%) 66% $5.1 billion (5%) $674 billion\n\nOverall, let's give Mastercard the slight edge for growing its top and bottom lines at a better clip than Visa. Still, it is important to note Visa's best-in-class operating margin as an honorable mention.\n\nMastercard and Visa prioritize shareholders\n\nMastercard and Visa management teams have similar capital allocation strategies in that they both regularly increase their dividends and repurchase shares of their companies. Both strategies benefit shareholders, with income in the case of dividends and increased ownership in the case of stock buybacks.\n\nFirst, Mastercard has paid and raised its dividend for 14 consecutive years. Its most recent raise was 15%, bringing its quarterly dividend to $0.76 per share or 0.54% annual yield. Mastercard's payout ratio -- the percentage of a company's earnings paid out as dividends -- is notably low at 19%. For reference, a prolonged payout ratio of 75% or higher usually signals that a stock's dividend is in danger of being cut or dropped altogether.\n\nVisa has paid and raised its quarterly dividend for 16 consecutive years, with its last raise coming in at 13%. Today, Visa pays a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share, which equates to an annual yield of 0.68% and a payout ratio of about 22%.\n\nBoth companies regularly participate in share repurchases in an effort to consistently lower their share count. Over the past three years, Mastercard lowered its shares outstanding from 980 million to 914 million, a decrease of 6.7%. Meanwhile, during the same period, Visa reduced its shares outstanding from 2.13 billion to 1.93 billion, a decrease of 9.4%.\n\nNeither management appears to be slowing down soon. At the end of the most recently reported quarters, Mastercard had $15.1 billion remaining on its share repurchase programs, and Visa had $9.1 billion remaining.\n\nOverall, both companies represent some of the most shareholder-friendly stocks available on the public market. Still, Visa has a slight edge in this category, given its higher annual yield and share count reduction over the past few years.\n\nAn overview of Mastercard's and Visa's valuations\n\nConsidering these competitors' similarities, one last comparison we can make is each stock's valuation. For well-established companies such as Mastercard and Visa, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- measuring a company's current market price to its trailing 12 months of earnings per share -- fits the bill. As of this writing, Mastercard and Visa traded at P/E ratios of 41 and 35, respectively. Since Mastercard has a higher growth rate, it historically has a higher P/E ratio, with its five-year median being 38 compared to Visa's 32.\n\nWith that said, both management teams expect their respective revenue to grow in the low double digits for their respective fiscal 2025 years. There's an argument that Mastercard may not deserve the same premium as it has enjoyed in recent years. Additionally, Visa has a slightly better balance sheet, with $6.3 billion in net debt compared to Mastercard's $9.5 billion.\n\nGiven those factors, Visa is the better value stock and wins the final category.\n\nIs Mastercard or Visa the better stock for dividend investors?\n\nTo reiterate, both Mastercard and Visa have proven to be fantastic long-term investments, and there's no reason to doubt their futures or continued dividend growth potential. However, if you were to pick between the two right now, Visa would be the better stock because of its higher dividend yield, comparable growth projections, and more attractive valuation.",

The changes include getting rid of an English-language test, shifting the amount of time people have to stay in New Zealand, and expanding the options for acceptable investments.\n\nStarting April 1, the Active Investor Plus visa will be split into two categories\u2014growth and balanced, Bloomberg noted. The former will require a minimum investment of 5 million New Zealand dollars ($2.8 million) over three years into businesses or managed funds, and the visa holder has to spend just 21 days in the country. The latter requires a minimum investment of 10 million New Zealand dollars ($5.7 million) over five years into bonds, stocks, new property development, or existing commercial and industrial property. Those with this visa have to spend at least 105 days in New Zealand, but that term can be reduced by investing more money than the minimum.\n\nThe changes are being made to lure more wealthy foreigners to New Zealand, as the current golden-visa program has withered in recent years, Bloomberg wrote. After rule revisions in late 2022, just 43 applications have been approved in full, resulting in 545 million New Zealand dollars ($307.9 million) of nominated investment funds, according to Immigration New Zealand data cited by the outlet. Prior to those changes, the program brought in about 1 billion New Zealand dollars ($570 million) every year.\n\n\u201cCapital is highly mobile and in an increasing complex world, people are looking for a safe and stable country to do business,\u201d said Erica Stanford, the country\u2019s immigration minister. \u201cWe are now making our investor visa simpler and more flexible to incentivize investors to choose New Zealand as a destination.\u201d\n\nWhile New Zealand works to attract more big spenders, other countries have been trying to limit or end their golden-visa programs, Bloomberg noted. Spain\u2019s will shut down on April 3, and countries such as the United Kingdom, Greece, and Malta have also ended or tightened the rules surrounding their schemes. Even nearby Australia has shuttered one of its programs: the Significant Investor visa class, for those who invest more than 5 million Australian dollars ($3 million).\n\nIt might be time for people interested in those destinations to check out New Zealand, then.",

With steady cash flow, the company continues to invest in infrastructure, marketing and promotions, ensuring long-term sustainability. As economies accelerate digital payments adoption, global cashless transactions are set to grow. With a $646.5 billion market cap, dominant market share and an extensive global network, Visa is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Even if short-term spending slows, the company\u2019s expanding partnerships, value-added services and strong margins will help maintain resilience.\n\nVisa Remains Unfazed: While concerns like inflation, depleting savingsand a tighter macroeconomic environment persist, Visa remains resilient. Since its revenues are tied to payments volume and transactions, shifts in consumer spending habits \u2014 such as reduced spending on big-ticket items \u2014 have had minimal impact. Visa makes money as long as transactions happen.\n\nMajor Metrics Continue to Rise: Visa\u2019s processed transactions grew 11% year over year to 63.8 billion and beat our model estimate. On a constant-dollar basis, the cross-border volume climbed 16% year over year in the quarter under review. These double-digit growth rates show no turbulence in its business. Also, its payment volumes grew 9% year over year on a constant-dollar basis.\n\nEarnings & Sales Beat: Visa\u2019s EPS of $2.75 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4% and grew 14% year over year. Also, the top line of $9.5 billion beat the consensus mark by 1.8% and improved 10% from a year ago.\n\nSince the earnings release, Visa shares have climbed 1.4%, bringing the stock close to its 52-week high of $351.25. This raises the question: Is now the time to take profits, or does Visa still have room to run? Let\u2019s break down the key takeaways from the earnings report.\n\nVisa Inc. V, the payments technology powerhouse, delivered impressive first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, driven by higher payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volumes. The company\u2019s expanding global footprint and strong demand for digital payments continue to fuel growth. Additionally, Visa\u2019s ongoing AI investments are strengthening its long-term prospects.\n\nStory Continues\n\nVisa\u2019s Diversification & Innovation Drive Growth\n\nVisa\u2019s revenue diversification strategy strengthens its ability to generate consistent earnings across economic cycles while reducing risk. Unlike traditional lenders, Visa does not carry credit risk, meaning rising delinquencies have little impact on its financial performance. The company is also expanding its reach through cryptocurrency innovations and digital wallet solutions, bringing more consumers and businesses into its network. Additionally, Visa continues to enhance cybersecurity and fraud prevention, making it a safer choice for both merchants and consumers.\n\nWith fraud cases on the rise and AI adoption increasing, Visa\u2019s services are in high demand. The company has embedded AI and generative AI into over 100 products, primarily for fraud prevention and cybersecurity. Visa has invested $3.5 billion in rebuilding its data platform, and the results speak for themselves\u2014its technology helps prevent $40 billion in fraud attempts annually.\n\nThrough strategic diversification, innovation, and AI-driven security, Visa is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\nVisa Continues to Reward Shareholders\n\nVisa remains highly profitable and consistently returns value to shareholders. In the last quarter alone, the company returned $5.1 billion through $3.9 billion in share buybacks and $1.2 billion in dividends. As of Dec. 31, 2025, Visa still had $9.1 billion authorized for future share repurchases. The company regularly increases dividends, with a current yield of 0.68%, almost in line with the industry of 0.67%.\n\nVisa Navigating Regulatory Hurdles\n\nVisa faces regulatory hurdles that could impact its short-term growth. Ongoing and potential legal battles may lead to financial liabilities and increased competition. In September 2024, the U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company. However, many investors saw the resultant dip in the stock as a buying opportunity.\n\nAnother challenge is the Credit Card Competition Act of 2023, which aims to increase competition and lower merchant costs. This legislation targets both Visa and Mastercard Incorporated MA, aiming to curb their duopoly outside the Eastern Hemisphere, where UnionPay dominates. The full impact of regulatory changes and shifting political dynamics will unfold in the coming months, shaping Visa\u2019s competitive landscape.\n\nFavorable Estimates for Visa\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa\u2019s fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 EPS implies a 12.1% and 12.7% uptick, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Similarly, the consensus mark for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 revenues suggests a 10% and 10.3% increase, respectively. It witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions in the past week.\n\nThe company beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average of more than 3%.

(NYSE:V) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses that are leading the Dow higher in 2025.\n\nOn Thursday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, drew attention to ten stocks that have been driving the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025. He described some of these stocks as \u201cquiet winners,\u201d noting that many of them, particularly those outside the tech sector, are often overlooked by Wall Street despite their strong contributions to the market\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cI gotta tell you, we got some real strange leadership this year. When you look at the quiet winners of 2025, the ones that don\u2019t belong to the Magnificent Seven, the ones that are unsung, even as they got us where we are so far this year, it\u2019s a real low-key hodgepodge.\u201d He elaborated on this, emphasizing that the stocks leading the charge in 2025 form an eclectic mix that may seem unconventional. Some of these companies were prominent in the past but have been largely forgotten, while others are relatively invisible, making steady gains that often go unnoticed.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Highlighted Buying Opportunities in 13 Stocks\n\nHe elaborated on this, emphasizing that the stocks leading the charge in 2025 form an eclectic mix that may seem unconventional. Some of these companies were prominent in the past but have been largely forgotten, while others are relatively invisible, making steady gains that often go unnoticed.\n\nAccording to Cramer, these stocks represent a sharp contrast to the giant, high-profile names that dominate everyday conversations about the market. He remarked that on a day when the Dow dropped by 126 points, the S&P rose by 0.36%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.51%, it was worth taking a closer look at the stocks driving the Dow higher, as this index is composed of some of the most established companies that, despite their storied histories, do not typically get the media attention they deserve. Cramer concluded by stating that the performance of these quieter, non-tech stocks so far this year has been significant.\n\n\u201cBottom line: So far this year, we\u2019ve had many very big winners outside of tech, and I bet most of them can keep quietly working their way higher.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 6. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

These programs let students work temporarily in the US after their studies, offering a crucial pathway to gaining practical experience.\n\nBut proposed policy changes under the Trump administration could reshape this landscape entirely. The H-1B visa rules have already faced significant changes under US President Donald Trump. Trump has also signed an executive order cancelling Birthright Citizenship, which is going to affect millions.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nOPT allows international students on F-1 visas to work in fields related to their studies for up to 12 months after graduation. STEM graduates can extend this period by an additional 24 months. However, critics argue that the program lacks oversight and is vulnerable to misuse.\n\nAccording to policy experts, some institutions have exploited OPT and CPT by creating fake schools, allowing students to work illegally in the US.\n\nA report submitted to the Congress urged stricter rules on schools that issue student visas (I-20 forms) and suggested that institutions with high visa overstay rates lose their ability to enrol international students.\n\nThe US has struggled with student visa overstays, particularly among F-1 and M-1 visa holders. In 2023 alone, 7,000 students from India overstayed their visas \u2014 the highest number among all countries. Brazil, China, and Colombia also reported significant overstays, contributing to a broader concern about visa abuse.\n\nCritics of OPT have labelled it a \u201cguest worker program killing jobs for new American college grads.\u201d The potential elimination or reduction of OPT sparked fears during Trump\u2019s first presidency, with estimates suggesting it could result in 443,000 job losses over a decade, including 255,000 jobs held by U.S.-born workers.\n\nIf Vaughan\u2019s recommendations gain traction, foreign students may face stricter visa requirements and a more challenging process for obtaining an I-20 form.

            "content": "Poll Does Stricter U.S. Immigration Policy Violate Human Rights? No, It\u2019s Necessary Yes, It\u2019s Unfair\n\nSeveral steps being considered by the administration of US President Donald Trump are cause for worry for thousands of Indians in the US, who are on H-1B work permits and face long green card backlog.First, the potential revocation of birthright citizenship, for which President Trump has signed an executive order, is a deeply concerning issue for Indian families on H-1B visas who are expecting children in the United States. While this policy is currently being challenged in court and remains on hold, its implementation\u2014however unlikely\u2014would have profound implications.One of the most significant challenges would be the increase in the number of \u201caging-out\u201d children, who are not covered under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and would lose the automatic legal status that US birthright citizenship provides. There are over 200,000 young immigrants, a large number of them Indians, who went to America with their parents as dependent children and then aged-out when they turned 21, according to estimates. They have to either self-deport, despite having lived in the US for several years and grown up and attended school and college there, or become undocumented immigrants.The issue of children aging out of dependent visa status is already one of the most challenging problems for Indian professionals on H-1B visas, and any policy change revoking birthright citizenship would only exacerbate it.\u201cThis would add further complexity to an already overburdened green card backlog, disproportionately affecting H-1B holders from India. Given the existing decades-long wait times for employment-based green cards, the inability to secure US citizenship at birth could leave these children in a precarious immigration status as they reach adulthood,\u201d Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting skilled Indians stuck in long green card queues, told the Times of India.The issue of birthright citizenship is currently being challenged in the US courts, and the executive order attempting to revoke it is on hold. Given the strong constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment, any attempt to alter this long-standing principle is likely to face significant legal hurdles.Earlier this week, a federal judge in Seattle has indefinitely blocked President Trump\u2019s executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship. Historically, US courts have consistently upheld birthright citizenship, making it highly probable that this issue will remain tied up in litigation for an extended period. Any definitive change would require not just executive action but a constitutional amendment or a landmark Supreme Court ruling.\u201cFor now, the legal and constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship remains strong. However, any change to this principle would necessitate significant legislative and judicial battles, given its far-reaching consequences on immigrant communities and the broader US economy,\u201d Mahajan said.Currently, children born in the United States to immigrant parents\u2014whether on work visas or otherwise\u2014are granted automatic US citizenship, providing a crucial safeguard against the severe green card backlog that disproportionately affects Indian H-1B holders. \u201cThis backlog, with decades-long wait times, leaves many high-skilled professionals in an uncertain immigration status for most of their careers. Birthright citizenship has been one of the few stabilising factors for their families,\u201d Mahajan said. She added that the United States\u2019 policy of birthright citizenship has historically set it apart from other developed nations, making it a more attractive destination for global talent.Another issue that could pose challenges for Indian professionals in the US, on H-1B visas, is the move to revoke employment authorisation documents for spouses of H-1B visa holders who are on dependent H-4 visas. \u201cThe H-4 EAD was introduced through an executive order by the Barack Obama administration after years of advocacy, providing much-needed relief and economic independence to many spouses of H-1B visa holders. However, under the administration of Trump\u2019s first term, there was a concerted effort to revoke H-4 EADs, creating uncertainty and hardship for thousands of skilled immigrant women. Thanks to relentless advocacy\u2014by organisations like SIIA and many women who chose to raise their voices\u2014the effort to eliminate H-4 EADs was ultimately unsuccessful,\u201d Mahajan said.She added that the broader immigration system has become increasingly difficult to navigate for Indians in the US who are waiting on green card queues. \u201cEven routine H-4 EAD renewals have faced delays, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to employment disruptions and financial instability for many families from India, who already face disproportionately long wait times for permanent residency.\u201dThere are also fears now among Indian professionals, on temporary work visas in the US, on reversal of the Joe Biden administration\u2019s order on automatic extension in certain categories of work permits. \u201cThese extensions were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to streamline the renewal process and prevent unnecessary employment disruptions. Any move to revoke automatic work permit extensions would have a significant impact on Indian professionals, particularly those on H-4 EADs,\u201d Mahajan said. The automatic extensions allowed individuals to continue working while their renewal applications were pending, eliminating the need for additional biometrics appointments\u2014a requirement that had been introduced under the earlier Trump administration.\u201cTraditionally, H-1B and H-4 petitions were processed together, ensuring timely approvals. However, if the Trump administration issues new guidance to separate these filings, it could lead to increased delays in work authorisation extensions. This would disproportionately impact H-4 visa holders, many of whom are highly skilled professionals contributing to the US workforce,\u201d Mahajan said.For Indian professionals already navigating decades-long green card wait time, these likely policy changes, being considered by the Trump administration create additional uncertainty and financial instability.",

The trend is expected to persist in 2025, but long wait times for tourist visas remain a significant hurdle.Currently, wait times for B1 (business) and B2 (tourism) visas at major US consulates in India are lengthy. Mumbai applicants face a waiting period of 444 days, while New Delhi is slightly better at 442 days. Chennai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad are not far behind with waiting periods of 436, 415, and 429 days, respectively. With these long delays, Indian travelers are exploring alternative ways to secure a US visa appointment sooner.If you\u2019re planning an international trip, applying for a US visa at a destination with shorter wait times could be a viable solution. Here's a look at wait times at various global destinations:While some countries have shorter wait periods, others likeandhave longer waits, similar to India. Kathmandu in Nepal has a waiting period of 221 days, while Abu Dhabi tops the list with a lengthy 433-day wait.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)If you're planning to apply from a foreign country, here are a few key points to keep in mind:Non-residents can apply for US visas in third countries, but consular officials might question why you're applying outside India.Applicants should be ready to explain that the extended wait time in India forced them to seek appointments elsewhere.Ensure you carry all required documents, including the DS-160 confirmation page, appointment letter, financial proof, and any supporting travel records.Allocate additional days for visa processing in case follow-up appointments are required.Traveling to these destinations is relatively simple for Indian travelers:Direct flights are available from New Delhi, Mumbai, and other metro cities.

Those who previously held H-1B registrant accounts for the FY 2021\u2013FY 2024 registration periods but did not participate in FY 2025 will have their accounts converted to organisational accounts upon their next login.\n\nFirst-time registrants can create accounts at any time. Additional resources and step-by-step video guides are available on the Organizational Accounts FAQ page, which will be updated with FY 2026 information before the registration period opens.\n\nProcess for representatives and registrants While representatives can add clients to their accounts at any time, the submission of beneficiary information and payment of the $215 fee can only be completed starting March 7. Selection will take place after the registration period ends, meaning there is no advantage to registering early.\n\nBeneficiary-centric selection process The FY 2026 H-1B visa cap will continue to use the beneficiary-centric selection process introduced in FY 2025. Under this system, registrations are selected based on unique beneficiaries rather than individual registrations. If USCIS receives sufficient unique beneficiary registrations by March 24, a random selection will be conducted. Notifications will be sent via USCIS online accounts by March 31.\n\nTemporary increase in credit card limit To accommodate the high volume of registrations, the US Department of Treasury has temporarily increased the daily credit card transaction limit from $24,999.99 to $99,999.99 for the FY 2026 H-1B cap season. Transactions exceeding this limit can be processed via Automated Clearing House (ACH). Employers using ACH should check with their banks to ensure there are no ACH blocks on their accounts.\n\nFiling eligibility for selected petitions Only petitioners whose registrations were selected in the H-1B process may file cap-subject petitions, including those eligible for the advanced degree exemption. More details on the electronic registration process are available on the H-1B Electronic Registration Process page.\n\nOrganisational account enhancements For FY 2026, USCIS has introduced several enhancements to organizational and representative accounts, including:\n\nParalegals can now collaborate with multiple legal representatives, allowing them to prepare H-1B registrations, Form I-129 petitions, and Form I-907 requests for premium processing across different attorney accounts.\n\nA streamlined process for legal representatives to add paralegals to company accounts.\n\nPre-population of select Form I-129 fields from chosen H-1B registrations.\n\nA new feature allowing bulk uploads of H-1B beneficiary data via spreadsheet, simplifying data entry for registrations.\n\nThese enhancements aim to improve efficiency and will be active before the registration period begins.\n\nAlso Read | American colleges prove the worth of H-1B visas",

            "content": "Here Are 10 World\u2019s Most Difficult Countries to Get a Visa and It Becomes A Nightmare for Tourists!\n\nThe world of travel is filled with enticing destinations, but not every country welcomes tourists with open arms. While many nations have relaxed their visa policies to boost tourism, others maintain some of the most grueling and bureaucratic visa processes. For travelers, these countries present an uphill battle of paperwork, fees, and endless waiting periods. Whether due to political reasons, security concerns, or strict immigration policies, these destinations are some of the hardest places to visit.\n\n1. North Korea \u2013 The Ultimate Secrecy Fortress\n\nNorth Korea remains one of the most impenetrable nations in the world. The government only grants visas to select individuals, mainly organized tour groups from China. Independent travel is virtually impossible. Journalists, foreign government officials, and individuals deemed suspicious are frequently denied entry. Travelers must surrender their passports upon arrival and are strictly monitored throughout their stay.\n\n2. Turkmenistan \u2013 The Hermit Kingdom of Central Asia\n\nTurkmenistan issues visas at an astonishingly low approval rate. The country requires a detailed itinerary, sponsorship from a local entity, and often demands an in-person interview at its embassy. Transit visas, although theoretically easier to obtain, still involve an unpredictable approval process. Many applicants wait months only to face rejection with no clear explanation.\n\n3. Saudi Arabia \u2013 Once Inaccessible, Still Complicated\n\nSaudi Arabia has eased its visa policies in recent years, launching an e-visa program for tourists. However, it remains challenging for certain nationalities to secure approval. Prior to its tourism overhaul, the country only granted visas for religious pilgrimages, business purposes, or family visits. Women under 25 still face additional restrictions and may require a male guardian for approval.\n\n4. Iran \u2013 Bureaucratic and Politically Challenging\n\nIran\u2019s visa process varies based on nationality. U.S., U.K., and Canadian citizens must apply through an approved tour operator and are often required to be accompanied by a guide throughout their visit. Processing times can be long, and visa denials are common, particularly for those with prior travel history to Israel. Even for those who obtain a visa, scrutiny at border controls remains high.\n\n5. Bhutan \u2013 High Costs and Limited Entry\n\nBhutan strictly controls tourism by imposing a hefty daily fee of around $250 per person. This Sustainable Development Fee (SDF) covers accommodation, food, transportation, and a mandatory guide. Travelers must book through an approved tour operator, and visas are only issued upon full payment of the travel package. While not impossible, the high cost serves as a deterrent for budget travelers.\n\n6. Eritrea \u2013 The African Fortress\n\nEritrea is one of Africa\u2019s most isolated nations, and its visa approval process is notoriously slow and complex. Applicants often face prolonged waiting times with no clear communication. Even once granted a visa, movement within the country is highly restricted, requiring additional permits for travel outside the capital, Asmara.\n\n7. Syria \u2013 Political Turmoil and Extreme Vetting\n\nDue to ongoing conflict, Syria remains one of the hardest places to visit. The visa application process is extensive, requiring sponsorship from a local or business entity. Security checks are rigorous, and approvals are rare, especially for citizens from Western nations. Travelers with Israeli stamps in their passports are outright denied entry.\n\n8. Russia \u2013 Bureaucracy at Its Peak\n\nRussia\u2019s visa process involves a mountain of paperwork, including an official invitation letter, proof of accommodation, and financial stability verification. The application requires fingerprinting, and processing times vary widely. The country\u2019s strict visa regime makes spontaneous travel nearly impossible, and any error in documentation can result in denial.\n\n9. China \u2013 Stringent Scrutiny and Limited Approvals\n\nDespite welcoming millions of tourists annually, China imposes a strict visa application process. Applicants must provide extensive documentation, including past travel history, employer details, and proof of financial solvency. Those with previous visits to politically sensitive areas, such as Tibet, may face additional questioning or denial.\n\n10. Nigeria \u2013 Endless Paperwork and High Fees\n\nNigeria\u2019s visa process is notorious for its excessive documentation requirements and high fees. Applicants must submit multiple references, invitation letters, and proof of financial means. The process is often prolonged, and visa approvals can be unpredictable. Corruption in the system also makes acquiring a visa a frustrating experience for many travelers.\n\nFor travelers eager to explore the world, visa restrictions remain a significant barrier. While some countries use stringent visa policies as a means of security, others leverage them to control tourism or restrict access altogether. Regardless of the reason, navigating these difficult visa applications requires patience, meticulous preparation, and sometimes, sheer luck!\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nRead Travel Industry News in 104 different regional platforms\n\nGet our daily dose of news, by subscribing to our newsletters.

Stanford acknowledges that \u201cbuying a home is important\u201d while noting that \u201cmany people are lining up for this new visa who know that they can\u2019t buy a home but are still prepared to invest.\u201d\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Winston Peters signals openness to change. He told The Post the country is \u201cnot selling ourselves out if you are investing in New Zealand, and you are going to have a massive part in building our economy if home-ownership, while you do that, is part of it,\u201d Peters explains.\n\nThe government banks on New Zealand\u2019s geographic isolation and political tranquility to attract ultra-wealthy investors in an increasingly turbulent world. Stanford says interest has been \u201cphenomenal now that we have signaled that we\u2019re open to the world.\u201d",

            "content": "The H-1B Lottery in Times of Change\n\nTopics: Immigration\n\nIn their few weeks in power, the incoming administration made many changes to immigration policy. One thing that has not changed is the H-1B lottery. On Wednesday, USCIS announced the dates for submission and processing for the Fiscal Year 2026 H-1B lottery entries. Employers use H-1B visas to employ foreign nationals in \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d or positions that require a bachelor\u2019s degree in a particular field. A typical user of the H-1 visa is an employer who wishes to retain the services of a foreign student employed using an F-1 Optional Practical Training Employment Authorization Document. However, given the new administration\u2019s rapid changes to immigration policy, employers should consider this visa for a wider set of foreign national employees.\n\nH-1B visas are very popular. Federal law limits the number of new H-1B visas to 85,000 per year. Every year, USCIS received hundreds of thousands of requests for H-1B visas. Because demand for H-1 visas far outstrips supply, USCIS distributes the opportunity to apply for these visas using a lottery via its online filing portal. Employers wishing to participate in the lottery must have an organizational account, and supply USCIS with a modicum of information regarding the proposed employee. This information includes name, date and place of birth, gender, passport information, and educational attainment. Additionally, employers must pay a $215.00 filing fee for every employee they wish to submit. If selected, employers may then submit an H-1B petition on behalf of their employee.\n\nUSCIS begins accepting entries into the FY 2026 lottery on Friday, March 7, 2025 and stops accepting entries on Monday, March 24, 2025. A few days after the submission period closes, USCIS will select and inform the selected employers via the USCIS filing portal. Employers will then have until June 30, 2025 to submit an I-129 Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker requesting H-1B visa status for the selected employee. If approved, the employee will then receive H-1B status or an H-1B visa on October 1, 2025.\n\nThe big change to the lottery this year is the filing fee. In years past, the lottery entry fee was $10.00. This year, it\u2019s $215.00. It\u2019s unclear how this filing fee change will affect demand. In years past, since the barrier to entry to the H-1B lottery was so low, individuals would use multiple shill employers to enter the lottery. The fee increase will likely curtail this behavior. Also, given the steep increase in the filing fees, employers would be well served to consult with an immigration attorney. Since selection in the lottery only grants an employer the right to file a petition for an H-1 visa and not the visa, employers should seek counsel on the approvability of their employee and job before entering the lottery.\n\nFinally, the H-1 lottery may be an opportunity to retain employees who are affected by the new administration\u2019s policy changes. Employers may want to consider the H-1B visa for employees that they presently employ using TPS, one of the prior administration\u2019s parole programs, or DACA. On February 1st the new administration stripped Venezuelans of Temporary Protected Status and the legal right to work. Additional restrictions on the legal right to work are expected including recission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals regulations. Employers employing such individuals may be able to use the H-1B visa as a means to retain these employees. Moving an employee from one of these status to H-1B is not appropriate for all people, and even among the qualified, is not without risk. Consult with immigration counsel before choosing this course of action, and may the odds be ever in your favor.",

Photo: Pexels.\n\nIndia and China, the countries with the most international students in the US, recorded the highest number of student overstays\n\nBy percentage, the top five overstay rates were recorded by African countries, the highest being 70%\n\nSector leaders have urged caution around using overstay data, calling it \u201cunreliable\u201d\n\nOver 7,000 of these student and exchange visitors that overstayed their visas came from India, house representatives heard in a committee hearing on immigration enforcement in the US on January 22.\n\n\u201cThirty-two countries have student/exchange visitor overstay rates of higher than 20%,\u201d Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the anti-immigration think-tank, the Center for Immigration Studies, told the committee.\n\nHowever, sector leaders have argued that Vaughan\u2019s testimony contained \u201csome serious and inaccurate generalisations\u201d and relied on \u201cfaulty statistics for her claim about the student visa overstay rate,\u201d according to NAFSA\u2018s director of immigration policy, Heather Stewart.\n\n\u201cInternational students are the most tracked non-immigrants in the US and a clear and comprehensive understanding of student visa misuse is needed if the field is to arrive at effective and appropriate solutions,\u201d said Stewart.\n\nAfter India, Vaughan highlighted China, Colombia and Brazil as each having more than 2,000 of their citizens overstay student/exchange visas in 2023, urging Congress to eliminate OPT and impose penalties for institutional sponsors, among a host of regulations.\n\n\u201cThe F and M visa categories have [the] highest overstay rates of any of the broad categories of temporary admission,\u201d Vaughan told committee members, with F visas used for academic study and M visas for vocational study.\n\nAccording to recent DHS figures, the total overstay rate for student and exchange visitors in 2023 was 3.67% with a suspected in-country overstay rate of 2.86%, dropping slightly to 2.69% solely for F-1 students, with all metrics excluding Mexico and Canada.\n\nCountries with highest student/exchange overstay rates by numbers (2023):\n\nCountry Suspected in-country overstays Total overstays Total overstay rate India 5,818 7,081 4.67% China 3,012 5,255 2.1% Colombia 2,792 3,223 8.29% Brazil 1,692 2,198 4.6% Source: US Homeland Security Entry/Exit Overstay Report FY 2023\n\nWhile India, China, Colombia and Brazil recorded the largest numbers of student overstays in 2023, their overstay rate as a percentage of overall student populations in the US were relatively low.\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that India and China, whose combined student populations made up 54% of total international enrolments at US institutions in 2023/24, also saw the highest levels of visa overstays.\n\nCountry Total overstay rate Equatorial Guinea 70.18% Chad 55.64% Eritrea 55.43% Congo (Kinshasa) 50.06% Djibouti 43.75% Burma 42.17% Yemen 40.92% Sierra Leone 35.83% Congo (Brazzaville) 35.14% Togo 35.05% Global (excl. Mexico + Canada) 3.67% Source: US Homeland Security Entry/Exit Overstay Report FY 2023\n\nNotably, the \u2018in-country overstay rate\u2019 refers to the percentage of individuals suspected to still be physically present in the US after their visa expired, while the \u2018total overstay rate\u2019 includes both those still in the country and those who may have eventually left after overstaying their visa, but were not recorded as departing.\n\nSector members have raised concerns about the \u201ctroubling\u201d scale of the problem uncovered by the report, ranging from benign violations of legitimate students to \u201ccases of wilful fraud\u201d, said Eddie West and Anna Esaki-Smith, two leading US educators.\n\nNAFSA, however, has disputed the figures as \u201cunreliable\u201d, claiming that the report \u201coverstates\u201d the issue and urged stakeholders to take caution when taking the figures out of context.\n\nIndeed, DHS concedes that \u201cinfrastructural, operational and logistical challenges\u201d in the exit environment make it difficult to identify students who do not depart via air or who transition from F-1 status to H-1B, legal permanent residency and other statuses.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, DHS data revealed a 42% decline in the suspected overstay rate for student and exchange visitors across a 15-month period ending in January 2024, indicating a lag time for the system to register students\u2019 changing situations.\n\n\u201cNot only do visa issuance policies need to be adjusted and interior enforcement boosted, in addition Congress should amend the law in several important ways,\u201d Vaughan told the hearing.\n\nIn a statement raising some concern about Vaughan\u2019s testimony, she recommended that \u201cthe concept of dual intent should not apply to student visa applicants\u201d.\n\nUnder current law, it does not.\n\nWhile the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program has been widely proven to benefit American workers as well as international graduates, Vaughan blamed the initiative for spawning \u201can industry of diploma mills and fake schools\u201d, calling for it to be eliminated or \u201cmuch, much more closely regulated\u201d.\n\nVaughan also recommended stricter regulations on H1-B specialty occupation visas, a move which Stewart warned would \u201cimmediately\u201d make the US look less attractive to international students who \u201cstrongly consider\u201d post-study employment opportunities when deciding where to study abroad.\n\nDuring Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, he surprised some of the sector.\n\nThe second-time US president spoke out in support of the H1-B visa during his presidential campaign amid a row about the work pathway among prominent Republicans.\n\nThe US is the only one out of the \u2018Big Four\u2019 study destinations \u2013 US, UK, Australia and Canada \u2013 to publish data on international student overstay rates.",

(NYSE:V) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence in finance has led many investors to question whether AI-powered tools like ChatGPT can effectively pick stocks. While ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of financial data, market news, and historical trends, their ability to consistently outperform human experts or quantitative models remains debatable. Instead, investors should look towards AI-driven hedge funds, such as Renaissance Technologies and Two Sigma, that have historically outperformed the market using machine learning models. For example, the Medallion Fund of the former achieved an annualized return of 66% before fees from 1988 to 2018. These funds rely on proprietary algorithms, high-frequency trading, and massive datasets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOne indicator of hedge funds being ahead of the curve when it comes to stocks and the broader market in general is a recent Goldman Sachs note to investors which details that top hedge funds navigated the recent tech selloff without significant losses, even managing to post nominal gains since the turn of the year despite a big dropoff in the market amid concerns over trade tariffs and an AI bubble. Per a report by news agency Reuters, US President Trump has delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico by one month, fueling wild swings in currency, bond and share markets. Despite the turmoil, stock-picking hedge funds that take bets based on company fundamentals recorded an average 2.6% return, their best month since February 2024, given a broader market rally, the report claimed.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nThe stocks listed below were mentioned in articles by prominent finance publications as some of the best ChatGPT stock picks over the past six months.

On January 17, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a final rule to inhibit fraud and abuse of the H-1B cap lottery and give petitioners and legal representatives some clarity regarding the H-1B cap process.\n\nFor the first time, F-1 students will benefit from an extended cap-gap period where their work authorization will be automatically extended until April 1 of the following calendar year.

Feel. Different.\"\n\nApplication forms for US visas specifically ask about current and past drug use and admitting this can lead to applications being rejected.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation argued that the law \"generally renders such a person inadmissible for entry\" to the US - though immigration officers make final decisions based on a number of factors.\n\nIn light of Harry\u2019s admission to drug use, the think tank called for the DHS to make his papers public to see whether he had lied on his forms. They also questioned whether Harry was given special treatment by the Biden administration.\n\nopen image in gallery Kevin Roberts, president of The Heritage Foundation.

In light of H-1B cap registration volume and higher fees, the U.S. Department of the Treasury increased its daily credit card transaction limit from $24,999.99 to $99,999.99 per day.\n\nUSCIS will again use the beneficiary-centric selection process originally launched in FY 2025. Through this process, registrations will be randomly selected by unique beneficiary rather than by registration. USCIS intends to start releasing lottery results by March 31, 2025.\n\nUSCIS reminded stakeholders that petitioning employers must create an organizational account through their online system if they did not create an account during the FY 2025 H-1B cap registration process. Additionally, while legal representatives may add company clients to their accounts at any time, it will not be possible to create H-1B cap registrations until the registration period opens on March 7, 2025.\n\nUSCIS also announced enhancements to the organizational account system it launched last year, including the following:\n\nThe ability for a paralegal to work with more than one legal representative. This will allow a paralegal account to prepare H-1B registrations, H-1B petitions, and requests for premium processing for multiple attorneys (representatives) within the legal team organizational account.\n\nAn easier process for legal representatives to add paralegals to different company clients.\n\nThe ability to upload a spreadsheet of H-1B beneficiary data into the system, allowing for that data to prepopulate into H-1B registrations.\n\nPrepopulation of some data from an H-1B registration into fields within Form I-129 (if prepared online).\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nLaunched in 2024, USCIS\u2019s successful organizational account system and beneficiary-centric selection process are here to stay in the FY 2026 H-1B cap registration lottery, and USCIS has already announced online system improvements based on feedback last year from petitioners and legal representatives. Employers may want to mark their calendars with this year\u2019s dates and check their USCIS online account access as they prepare for this year\u2019s H-1B cap season.\n\nOgletree Deakins\u2019 Immigration Practice Group will continue to monitor developments and will publish updates on the Immigration blog as additional information becomes available.\n\nFollow and Subscribe\n\nLinkedIn | Instagram | Webinars | Podcasts",

The company is benefiting from its diverse business model that spans multiple segments, channels and formats. The company's strong omnichannel strategy has boosted traffic across physical stores and digital platforms.\n\nWalmart\u2019s emphasis on improving delivery services has been successful, contributing to steady grocery market share gains. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year, and e-commerce sales surged.\n\nHowever, Walmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company\u2019s implied fourth-quarter view for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\n\nShares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+26.1% vs. +20.4%). The company\u2019s fiscal first-quarter earnings beat estimates by 3.4%. Its strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving revenues. It expects net revenues to grow in low double-digits in fiscal 2025.\n\nV is fueled by persistent increases in payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing significant profit growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and U.S. regions. Moreover, rising client incentives will affect its adjusted revenues.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\n\nAbbVie shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+13.3% vs. -0.6%). The company beats Q4 estimates for both earnings and sales. AbbVie has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications and should support top-line growth in the next few years.\n\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage candidates that have the potential to drive long-term growth. It expects to return to robust revenue growth in 2025 following the Humira LOE.\n\nHowever, the company faces several near-term headwinds like Humira\u2019s biosimilar erosion, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and slow market growth trend for Juvederm fillers in the United States and China.\n\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\n\nShares of AstroNova have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (-33.9% vs. +80.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $85.38 million is facing challenges which includes margin compression, liquidity pressures and delayed revenue realization from postponed shipments. Competitive pressures in digital printing, along with geopolitical risks, further weigh on performance.\n\nNevertheless, AstroNova's aerospace segment continues strong growth, with T&M revenues up 22.3% YoY, driven by robust demand for flight deck printers. Proprietary ToughWriter adoption is set to reach 89% of unit volume by FY27, reducing manufacturing complexity and royalties and enhancing long-term margins.\n\nIn the PI segment, the MTEX acquisition strengthens inkjet capabilities, supporting innovation and retrofitting initiatives. Recurring revenues, comprising 70% of total sales, ensure stability and cash flow consistency. Macro tailwinds in digital printing, coupled with operational excellence programs, position AstroNova for sustained expansion.\n\n(You can read the full research report on AstroNova here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

            "content": "In recent months, Spain has approved measures to streamline the visa process and better protect LBGTQ employees. It also has proposed raising the minimum wage and shortening the workweek.\n\nQuick Hits\n\nSpanish authorities are preparing to increase the minimum wage and shorten the workweek to 37.5 hours.\n\nSpain\u2019s government approved a measure to simplify the visa process.\n\nEmployers must take steps to protect LGBTQ workers from discrimination, harassment, and violence at the workplace.\n\nShorter Workweek and Higher Minimum Wage\n\nOn December 20, 2024, the Ministry of Labour and Social Economy published a draft law to reduce the workweek from 40 hours to 37.5 hours at the same pay rate. Anything above that amount would be considered overtime.\n\nIf the law passes Parliament, businesses and trade unions will be expected to comply with it by December 31, 2025. Companies will be required to maintain digital, real-time records of workers\u2019 hours. Spanish law grants employees the right to disconnect, meaning the right to not respond to work-related emails and texts outside of work hours.\n\nThe Spanish government also has proposed raising the minimum wage to \u20ac1,184 per month in fourteen payments. If approved, this will take effect retroactively from January 1, 2025.\n\nChanges to Visa Process\n\nThe Council of Ministers recently approved the new Regulation on Foreigners, which streamlines the process for immigrants to obtain work and residence permits. Initial visas will be valid for one year. Most renewals will last four years. The jobseeker visa, which previously lasted two years, has been reduced to one year.\n\nThe regulation will take effect May 20, 2025.\n\nProtections for LGBTQ Workers\n\nUnder Royal Decree 1026/2024, employers in Spain with more than fifty employees must take steps to prevent discrimination, harassment, and violence against LGBTQ individuals in the workplace. Employers must provide adequate training on the rights of LGBTQ individuals, and written policies must prohibit discrimination in the workplace with specific references to sexual orientation and gender expression.

Efficient and scalable solutions to disburse cash assistance are urgently needed.\n\nMany communities are underserved by traditional financial services and have limited access to fintech infrastructure. This can make it difficult to provide those communities with humanitarian aid assistance in the event of a crisis, such as a climate-related event or conflict.\n\nAs part of their new collaboration, ESTHER International and Visa aim to co-develop solutions that enable NGOs to accomplish more on the ground, at speed, with data capture and management tools that allow efficiencies at the operational level. ESTHER International and Visa plan to then test these solutions in pilot programs over the next 2 years.\n\nIn 2025, ESTHER International and Visa aim to launch the first pilot in collaboration with Maui Rapid Response, an emergency response NGO based in Hawaii, using the ESTHER platform to deliver financial aid via Visa cards to individuals and families whose lives have been devastated by wildfires.\n\nCarol Rossborough, CEO at ESTHER International, said: \u201cHumanitarian aid agencies and NGOs continue to face extreme pressure due to increasing global conflicts and climate change. An aggregated global payments solution that provides the efficiencies NGOs need can be part of the answer, and Visa\u2019s global network, as well as its money movement and innovation capabilities, make them the ideal collaborator for us.\u201d\n\nRajiv Garodia, Head of Visa Government Solutions, said: \"As the world faces unprecedented challenges in delivering humanitarian aid, our collaboration with ESTHER International is a crucial step towards ensuring that financial assistance reaches the most vulnerable communities quickly and efficiently.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the launch of this joint initiative contact info@estherinternational.com, telephone (+44)7446832070.\n\nAbout ESTHER International\n\nESTHER International is a leading FinTech organization dedicated to advancing humanitarian aid through innovative technology and partnerships.

In a letter to home secretary Yvette Cooper, chancellor Rachel Reeves and science minister Patrick Vallance, the committee\u2019s chair Julia King described the barriers faced by postgraduate students and early-career researchers who wish to move to the UK as \u2018an act of national self-harm\u2019.\n\nThe committee is calling for the government to review the \u2018high up-front burden\u2019 of current visa fees, pointing out that these are higher than any comparable country. Since 2022, the cost of a five-year skilled worker visa has increased by 22% to almost \u00a312,000, while the cost of a five-year global talent visa has risen by 58% to almost \u00a36000. On top of this, people moving to the UK also have to pay the immigration health surcharge, which has risen by 66% to \u00a31035 per year, with payment required for all years upfront.\n\nMeanwhile, new measures announced by the government last month mean that the cost of a certificate of sponsorship required by companies hiring foreign workers will increase by 120% to \u00a3525.\n\nIn the letter, King \u2013 an engineer who is chancellor at Cranfield University \u2013 also noted that her university had seen a 47% decline in the number of postgraduate taught students over two years, putting at risk \u2018a whole ecosystem\u2019 of research and teaching that relies on the subsidy from international student fees.\n\nKing points out that research, science and technology are key growth-driving sectors, but that the UK is \u2018at risk of falling behind in the race for talent in these critical areas\u2019 and that the country\u2019s immigration policy must adapt to recognise the global competition for talent.",

This issue was particularly acute in South Asia, where 28% of students cited visa delays as a primary obstacle.\n\nThe challenges didn\u2019t end at confirmation. Visa processing delays also disrupted orientation attendance, with 45% of students who missed orientation citing delayed visa approvals. These disruptions highlight a critical need for more streamlined and predictable visa processes to support international student mobility.\n\nJohn Sykes, CEO of INTO , said: \u201cThese findings serve as a powerful message for governments, educational authorities, and universities to work together in addressing visa delays, ensuring students are supported in their aspirations to study abroad. At INTO, we are dedicated to overcoming these challenges, driving positive change in international education, and continuing to create transformative opportunities for students to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world.\u201d\n\nThe survey also uncovered several other critical trends shaping the international education landscape.\n\nPre-arrival support makes a difference\n\nThe results underscore the need for visa support and pre-arrival services in creating a seamless experience for students as they begin their study abroad journey. To address the growing demand for such support, INTO has introduced a range of pre-arrival programs and support services.\n\nGet Ready to Study: INTO developed the online learning course \u2018 Get Ready to Study \u2019 to help UK-bound international students access key academic and personal tools to have a smooth transition into higher education and prepare for UK life and study. Students who participated in the program reported higher levels of satisfaction on arrival (89%) and preparedness for their studies (92%) compared to non-participants. These findings underscore the value of robust pre-arrival support in enhancing the student experience.\n\nThe high satisfaction rate from the program was reflected in the feedback, with one student commenting: \u201cIt prepares international students to know what they will face at INTO University Partnerships, and to acquire new skills.\u201d Another student shared: \u201cI was fully ready to start my program before my start date.\u201d\n\nPASS Program: INTO\u2019s PASS Program was developed to provide an enhanced level of visa support and guidance for US-bound international students. The program is free of charge, with a central goal of ensuring higher education in the US is more accessible to international students. Our recent survey shows that 94% of students who participate in PASS have high arrival satisfaction.\n\nIt has helped more than 2000 students so far from India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Turkey, Kenya, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Kazakhstan - among many others - successfully obtain their F-1 visas.\n\nPablo, an undergraduate student at Oregon State University, said: \u201cI think all students should speak with the PASS team before their first interview appointment, it is incredibly helpful.\"\n\nAutomated Credibility Interview: INTO has developed an automated system that identifies UK-bound international students most likely to be viewed as \u2018high-risk\u2019 by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI), offering a credibility interview as part of their visa application process.\n\nThese applicants are notified and urged to complete the Automated Credibility Interview when they receive their offer letter. This allows them to schedule an appropriate time to complete a self-recorded interview which can be completed at a time that best suits them. This self-recorded interview system ensures that applicants are able to receive an offer swiftly and prevents further delays to the application process. Over 100 students have submitted their visa application following successful completion of the automated credibility interview task so far.\n\nIncreasing competition among study destinations\n\nOver half of students considered alternative destinations before choosing the UK or US, with over 40% of those considering alternatives beyond the traditional \u201cBig 4\u201d\u2014 the UK, US, Canada, and Australia. Europe, in particular, remained a strong contender across all regions, reinforcing findings from INTO\u2019s 2024 Global Agent Survey . This trend highlights a rise in students exploring options closer to home to benefit from lower study costs and cultural proximity, reflecting the increasing competitiveness of global education markets.\n\nBeyond Europe, student preferences also followed similar regional patterns identified in INTO\u2019s 2024 Global Agent Survey. Students from East Asia were most likely to consider Singapore and Malaysia, while students from the Middle East and North Africa mainly looked to the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, and students from the China, Hong Kong, and Macau region gravitated towards Hong Kong.\n\nEmployability and career aspirations\n\nStudents indicated that the ability to secure internships, gain professional experience, and connect with employers while studying were among their top priorities. Around 50% say they plan to participate in work placements during their studies, while one-third intend to pursue post-study work opportunities through programs like the Graduate Route in the UK and OPT in the US.\n\nThis data reflects the growing emphasis on preparing students for the workforce in an increasingly competitive global job market and the critical role of employability-focused initiatives in attracting and retaining students. It also highlights the importance of ongoing support throughout their studies, ensuring access to work opportunities and career development while living in their chosen study destination.\n\nLast year, INTO launched its Return & Connect initiative, a platform designed to support international students returning to their home countries after completing their studies overseas, connecting them with employer and alumni networks, for in-market work experience and post-study work placements both during and after their study overseas.\n\nShifting decision drivers\n\nBeyond university rankings, factors like personal safety and employability have grown in importance over the past three years. Work experience opportunities are now the second-highest priority for South Asian students, while personal safety is a key consideration in the Middle East. Perceptions of safety and security, coupled with career prospects, are increasingly influencing students' final choices.\n\n\u201cThe insights from this survey not only help us understand the challenges faced by our students but also guide our efforts in creating impactful solutions,\u201d added Sykes. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of the work we do to support students, from pre-arrival programs to career readiness initiatives, ensuring their success both during and after their studies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a global leader in international student recruitment and support, INTO remains committed to addressing these challenges and creating seamless opportunities for students to achieve their academic and career goals.\u201d\n\nINTO connects ambitious international students with leading universities in the US, UK, and Australia. Since its inception in 2005, INTO has helped over 150,000 students from more than 180 countries achieve their dream of obtaining a degree from a world-class institution.\n\nRead the full survey findings here .\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3a82aff0-4c74-46c8-a244-25de5b2344b3",

Ukrainian families are still being displaced by relentless shelling as fighting advances toward their homes.\n\nThose who have found a safe haven in the UK share that the lack of a clear roadmap for their stay in the country, compounded by worrying headlines from home, leaves them feeling anxious about their future.\n\nMargarita Bondarenko, IRC Community Advisory Board member, said:\n\n\u201cThe urgent need for a permanent solution for Ukrainian refugees is more pressing than ever.\n\nTemporary status, while offering some form of security, has kept highly qualified Ukrainians from securing meaningful employment. Employers often overlook us in favor of candidates they see as more stable, despite our skills and potential. Meanwhile, many students have just begun their higher education, and now the question looms: Will they ever be able to complete it? The same uncertainty hangs over children in schools, as their futures are threatened by instability.\n\nAfter nearly 3 years in a new country, many of us have begun to build lives\u2014new friendships, new routines, new commitments. But the thought of losing it all again for some of us is unbearable. For young people especially, many of whom now speak English better than Ukrainian, a sudden upheaval can have profound effects on mental health and well-being, as they lose any sense of belonging they\u2019ve worked so hard to create. For example, my daughter, together with her two local friends, has created a band and might have a future.\n\nWe are not just refugees. We are families, students, workers, and human beings with hopes, dreams, and aspirations. We deserve more than uncertainty. We deserve the stability of a permanent solution, one that will allow us to rebuild, thrive, and contribute to the societies that have taken us in.\u201d\n\nDenisa Delic, IRC UK Advocacy Director, said:\n\n\u201cThe 18-month extension period is a window of opportunity to develop lasting solutions and ensure people can escape the limbo they currently face.\n\nWith no permanent scenarios in sight, Ukrainians are already at far greater risk of becoming homeless in the UK due to factors such as breakdowns in relationships with hosts, difficulties finding guarantors or funds for tenancy deposits, language barriers, compounded by challenges in navigating housing, education, or healthcare systems.\n\nThe UK government should explore options to help Ukrainian\u2019s who are currently living in the UK on temporary schemes to transition into more stable statuses, ensuring they maintain access to rights, essential services, integration support, and safeguards against forced returns.\u201d",

Thus, a singular state\u2019s attorney general could potentially sue for injunctive relief to stop visa issuance to nationals of entire countries.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIt will be important to closely monitor which countries are willing to cooperate with the Trump administration by repatriating and accepting their nationals who are ordered removed from the United States. Countries that deny or unreasonably delay repatriation could cause immense unintended issues for their nationals who are lawfully present in the United States or intend to lawfully enter the United States.

Together, these services will enable community and regional financial institutions to offer innovative digital payments solutions, attract and deepen relationships, and grow deposits.\u201d\n\nOffered only through financial institutions, Jack Henry Rapid Transfers is a cloud-native service providing real-time account-to-account money movement using the Visa Direct network. Once implemented, the service will allow for real-time account transfers, as well as quick access to funds for unexpected expenses, travel or urgent payments, the release added.\n\nVisa announced late last year that Visa Direct would make funds available within one minute and therefore in real time.\n\n\u201cThe announcement, where that functionality will be available starting in April of next year, underscores the fact that the payment networks \u2014 Visa and Mastercard \u2014 have been making strides to move their networks beyond cards, and facilitating payments, toward payouts (in use cases including government disbursements and earned wage access, among others) underpinned by globally trusted infrastructure,\u201d PYMNTS wrote soon after.\n\nThat infrastructure, that report added, also serves as the clearing and settlement services for the transactions themselves, ensuring funds are available, and so they can be disbursed faster.\n\nResearch last year by PYMNTS Intelligence found that more than half of consumers were not aware of pay-by-bank options, or showed some hesitancy about using them.\n\n\u201cIn an age where relationships with banks are nearly ubiquitous,\u201d that report said, \u201cthe move toward direct account-to-account (A2A) flows should be an intuitive one. But it hasn\u2019t been, at least not yet, though the rise of open banking promises to change that.\u201d\n\nSome of this issue is down to the speed of the transactions. Separate PYMNTS Intelligence research found 50% of consumers deal with up to a weeklong wait for payouts, in stark contrast to the 43% of consumers who prioritize real-time payments.",

It did not indicate if it would apply to people who commit criminal acts or people who engage in antisemitic acts, he said.\n\nHowever, Yohnka said the vagueness of the order and the First Amendment issues makes it difficult to enforce the order in any \u201cmeaningful way.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy first piece of advice for students on any campus is not to let this administration bully them into or coerce them into not participating in First Amendment activities and to continue to make their voices heard about public policy,\u201d Yohnka said. \u201cIt\u2019s an important, historic and traditional role that students play. It\u2019s needed now more than ever before.\u201d\n\nA student who participated in the pro-Palestinian encampment last April, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said they thought the order was \u201chorrible\u201d and a clear violation of free speech because it prevents criticism.\n\nInternational students are an integral part of the Northwestern community, but this order has terrified many of these students \u2014 especially if they have been vocal in the past about Palestine, the student said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen such a large movement of protesters on college campuses and in communities speaking out about Palestine, and President Trump is trying to use the weaker status of foreign students in this country and foreigners to silence them,\u201d the student said.\n\nThe student said they would love for the University to try to protect international students to the extent it can.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily, NU\u2019s Jewish Voice for Peace condemned the order for suppressing \u201cPalestinian solidarity\u201d on college campuses.\n\nJVP stated that the order \u201cdemonizes\u201d students at universities in a \u201cfascist\u201d attempt to deport university students, including members of the Jewish community.\n\n\u201cAs Jewish students, we are deeply concerned for the rising antisemitism happening blatantly in the US, and we understand actually ensuring Jewish safety will never involve displacement, deportation and detainment of people whether in the United States or Palestine,\u201d JVP wrote in a statement.\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n\u2014 Schill email provides updates and clarity following questions of federal funding freeze\n\n\u2014 University President Michael Schill addresses budget, immigration concerns during annual fireside chat\n\n\u2014 House report claims Schill \u2018misled Congress\u2019 in testimony, no NU student \u2018faced disciplinary sanctions\u2019 for encampment",

            "content": "Indian professionals have been flocking to Hindu temples believed to grant prayers for a US visa after Donald Trump signed several executive orders aimed at making immigration to the US more difficult.\n\nThe rush for divine help has been in evidence at Chamatkari Hanuman temple \u2013 popularly called \u201cVisa Hanuman\u201d \u2013 in Ahmedabad in the western state of Gujarat.\n\nThe temple priest Vijay Bhatt told the Times of India that visa applicants were asked to place their passports before Lord Hanuman, one of the most beloved Hindu deities and known for his monkey-like appearance, and then recite a devotional hymn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about faith,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cIf you believe, it will happen. If doubts creep in, disappointments follow.\u201d He claimed to have witnessed instances where devotees received approvals within hours of performing rituals, even after multiple rejections.\n\nSome travelled far from other states, convinced of the temple\u2019s reputation for securing visa approvals, Bhatt said.\n\nEmigrating to the US has long been a status symbol for many Indians. But Trump has put such ambitions in doubt, demanding tougher visa vetting procedures.\n\nHowever, there is a split among some of Trump\u2019s biggest backers over the flagship H-1B visa programme, which allows software engineers and other skilled workers to work in the US. At least two-thirds of H-1B recipients come from India.\n\nThe row has pitted technology industry supporters such as Elon Musk against immigration hardliners who want the scheme scrapped. Musk says the programme needs \u201cmajor reform\u201d but also that there is not enough homegrown talent to fill skilled jobs.\n\nAt Hyderabad\u2019s Chilkur Balaji temple \u2013 dubbed the \u201cVisa God\u201d shrine \u2013 aspiring emigrants have been chanting prayers, performing rituals and completing 108 circumambulations barefoot, hoping for divine intervention.\n\nAmong them was a software engineer from Hyderabad who was due to start a new job in New Jersey in April. He had received his H-1B visa approval and was back to offer thanks. \u201cEleven of us applied last year, but I was the only one who got it,\u201d the engineer told the Times of India, asking to remain anonymous.\n\nAnother software engineer, Chandana, 26, who did not want her last name used, said she was dismayed when Trump won. She had been visiting the temple every month since applying for a visa two years ago. \u201cI know things aren\u2019t looking bright right now, but I have faith I will get it, just like my relatives did,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Delhi\u2019s Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir, applicants are taking their devotion even further. \u201cMany people give up meat, alcohol, onion and garlic for 41 days hoping their visa will be granted,\u201d said Narayan Mishra, the temple priest.\n\nDevotees write their wishes on slips of paper, which are placed before the deity and chanted over before being stored in a sacred box. \u201cPeople come in a very disturbed state of mind. This is their last resort, and we usually find that their wishes do come true,\u201d Mishra said.",

Pro-Palestine protests took place on the UCLA campus last spring, leading to the arrests of over 200 people, including international students.\n\n[Related: Hundreds of protesters detained after police breach pro-Palestine encampment at UCLA]\n\n\u201cWe put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,\u201d Trump said in a fact sheet detailing the order. \u201cI will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.\u201d\n\nThe order references an immigration law that allows for the deportation of a noncitizen who \u201cendorses or espouses\u201d a terrorist organization, including Hamas, which the United States classified as a terrorist group in 1997.\n\nUndergraduate Students Association Council President Adam Tfayli said he believes around 10-20% of those arrested in pro-Palestine protests last spring were international students. The Daily Bruin was unable to verify this claim.\n\nTfayli, who participated in the first Palestine solidarity encampment at UCLA, added that he believes the order infringes upon freedom of speech.\n\n[Related: Counter-protester activity continues through 3rd night of pro-Palestine encampment]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very worrying,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it violates, to a certain extent, freedom of speech in many ways, just because only one side is being targeted.\u201d\n\nTfayli added that he would meet with members of the UCLA administration to explore protections for students.\n\nThe fact sheet also promises to use the U.S. Department of Justice to punish antisemitism in \u201cleftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\u201d\n\nStett Holbrook, a UC Office of the President spokesperson, said the University is currently reviewing the president\u2019s order.\n\nUCLA has faced allegations of antisemitism before, during and following the first encampment in April.\n\n[Related: Jewish students express concern over antisemitism on UCLA campus]\n\nThree Jewish students sued the university in May, claiming they faced antisemitic harassment from pro-Palestine protesters who allegedly created a \u201cJew Exclusion Zone\u201d in areas within and surrounding the encampment. A federal judge sided with the plaintiffs in August, ordering a preliminary injunction requiring UCLA to keep campus activities accessible to Jewish students \u2013 or prohibit them from happening at all.\n\n[Related: Court rules pro-Palestine protests cannot obstruct Jewish students\u2019 accessibility]\n\nHowever, Thomas Harvey, an attorney for Faculty for Justice in Palestine at UCLA, rejected the claim that the encampment was antisemitic, citing the fact that it took part in Jewish traditions such as a Seder and Shabbat.\n\n\u201cThe encampment in no way discriminated against anyone on the basis of religion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous to believe that anyone within that encampment was intending to, trying to, prevent people from coming in because they are Jewish.\u201d",

(NYSE:V) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now.\n\nA notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China\u2019s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market\u2019s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nFor example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company\u2019s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

            "content": "Ashok Sundar had just struck out '108' on the little chequered sheet standing inside the Chilkur Balaji temple - 20km from Hyderabad's skyscraper-studded Financial District. His beaming face, glossy polyester shirt and bright red vermilion tilak running right up to the hairline meant that the \"visa god\" had smiled upon him. Ashok got his passport stamped with H-1B a day earlier and was at the temple to show his gratitude. He leaves for his new tech job in New Jersey in April.There were many Ashoks in the sea of people chanting 'Govinda, Govinda' as they walked around the deity at the temple, less than a fortnight after Donald Trump took over as the 47th President of the US. Since taking office, Trump has threatened to send back \"millions and millions of criminal aliens\", send troops to the southern border, and has even ordered the revoking of citizenship status for children of temporary visa holders. The announcements have sent a chill down the spine of the immigrant community, both within the US and among those anxious to go there.Indians dreaming of a new life in the US are now clinging to faith in the hope of a miracle - whether it is the Chilkur Balaji temple near Hyderabad, the Chamatkari Hanuman temple at Ahmedabad or the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir in Delhi. \"Eleven of us had applied last year,\" says Ashok, after completing his 108th pradakshina (circumambulation) of the temple dedicated to an avatar of Vishnu. \"I am the only one who got the visa. It is only because of Lord Balaji,\" adds the IT executive. He had prayed at the temple after submitting his visa papers in June 2024.Ahmedabad's Chamatkari Hanuman temple, also called 'Visa Hanuman', has swelling crowds during the weekend, with just two prayers on their lips. Either it's \"Lord, please grant me a visa\" or it's \"Lord, thank you for the visa.\" The 300-year-old temple has earned a \"visa friendly\" reputation, drawing devotees from as far as J&K and Meghalaya.Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa after the pujari. The applicant is also asked to visit any Hanuman temple once a week and repeat the Hanuman Chalisa. \"It's all about one's 'shraddha'. If there is faith, all things are possible. If doubts creep into one's mind, then one is bound to face disappointment,\" says the priest, adding that he has been witness to instances where a visa has been secured within an hour of conducting the ritual, even after three or four visa denials. One such Ahmedabad resident whose US visa has been rejected once, got to know from friends that praying at the Chamatkari Hanuman temple will work wonders. \"I have complete faith that I will be granted a US visa in my next interview,\" he says, before going through the temple rituals.Down a dusty lane filled with hardware shops stands the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir at Delhi's Neb Sarai. Pandit Narayan Mishra, who has been officiating at the mandir for the last five years, says people give up meat, alcohol, onion and garlic for 41 days in their quest for the elusive visa stamp. \"They write their manokamna (wish) on a piece of paper. We take the slip of paper and make the idol 'read it' and chant the mantras. It is then placed in a box next to the deity,\" Mishra says.But what makes people come from across the country to the temple? \"Perhaps because Hanuman is considered the first god to have travelled outside the country to Lanka without any paperwork,\" he adds with a smile. Folklore or an attempt at humour, people in the area attest to the \"magical powers\" of the shrine. \"People come in a very disturbed state of mind. This is their last resort, and we usually find that their wishes do come true. Just last week, an applicant who got his US visa in only two weeks came to the temple for a puja to thank God,\" shares Mishra.Though Andhra software engineer Chandana C confesses to being crestfallen after Trump's success in the elections, she is now hopeful that her 25 visits to the Hyderabad temple in the last 25 months will not go in vain. \"I have been coming here every month since I applied for the visa through a local consultancy. I know things aren't looking bright right now, but I have faith I will eventually get it,\" says the 26-year-old desperate to realise her American dream, just like all her other relatives did.Not just for themselves, some even go through the ritual motions for their beloved kin. Kaushik R, on his 56th pradakshina, says that he is there to pray for his older brother living in North Carolina. \"I am praying that his name is selected in the lottery process, and he gets his H-1B. If all goes well, I will also join the University of Cincinnati for a MS programme later this year,\" says the freshly-minted engineering graduate - pinning his hopes on his talent and Lord Balaji in equal measure. \"But I will pray for myself later. This is for my brother,\" Kaushik adds, before quickly returning to his place in the queue. Right behind him is Ravindra R, who has landed himself his dream job in Texas. There's just one step for him to clear now: the visa interview. \"When I go for it, I know I will have Lord Balaji's blessings with me. Nothing can stop me,\" the IT professional says.With additional reporting from Meghdoot Sharon in Ahmedabad(Applicants' names changed on request)",

            "content": "Liu Lijun, a Chinese graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), has reportedly had her student visa revoked after organizing pro-Palestine rallies on campus.\n\nLiu was arrested in May 2024 during protests related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which began on October 7, 2023.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph India, the revocation of Liu\u2019s visa follows an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which aims to address antisemitism in response to the conflict. The order focuses on what the Trump administration has described as a rise in antisemitism across U.S. campuses and communities. One key provision of the order threatens to cancel visas for international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, particularly those with ties to Hamas.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiu\u2019s case is one of the first instances of visa revocation under the new policy. The executive order directs federal agencies, including Education, State, and Homeland Security, to develop recommendations on how to monitor and report the activities of foreign students and staff involved in such protests. Additionally, these agencies are required to provide the White House with recommendations within 60 days on the legal tools available to combat antisemitism.\n\nLiu was among hundreds of UCLA students participating in protests against Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza. The protests escalated in early May 2024 when law enforcement raided a solidarity encampment where nearly 400 demonstrators had gathered. According to protest organizers, over 100 people were injured in the raid, with some requiring hospital treatment. Police used flash-bangs and batons to disperse the crowd.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision to revoke Liu\u2019s visa aligns with his broader efforts to limit pro-Palestinian activism, particularly among international students. He referred to those involved in such protests as \u201cresident aliens\u201d and warned that they could face deportation by 2025. This has raised concerns that the broad language of the order could be used to target students who engage in peaceful protests without breaking the law.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has condemned the executive order, arguing that it infringes upon First Amendment rights. CAIR emphasized the importance of protecting free speech, stating that such rights should not be undermined through executive action.",

            "content": "Turkish diplomatic passport holders will be required to obtain a visa to enter the UK starting March 11, 2025, Turkey\u2019s presidential communications directorate said on Friday, claiming that it is part of a broader policy change affecting many diplomatic passport holders worldwide.\n\nThere have been no public announcements from the UK on the matter.\n\nConflicting reports emerged on Friday regarding new UK visa requirements for Turkish diplomatic passport holders, with the S\u00f6zc\u00fc newspaper initially claiming a measure singling out Turkey, while Turkish Foreign Ministry sources, speaking to the T24 news site, clarified that it\u2019s part of a broader UK policy change affecting all countries.\n\nThe discussion arose after the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued an official notice on January 24 to relevant state institutions about the change to UK visa policy related to diplomatic passport holders and exemption criteria.\n\nThe ministry said a technical meeting was held at the British Home Office on January 13 where the UK\u2019s Diplomatic Visa Arrangement (DVA) was discussed, after which it was confirmed that the new diplomatic rule would be effective from March 11, 2025, with the acceptance of visa applications starting on February 18.\n\nAccording to Turkish media reports, until March 11 Turkish diplomatic passport holders can continue to visit the UK without a visa. After that date, only ministers will be exempt for the purpose of an official visit.\n\nWhile S\u00f6zc\u00fc accurately reported the change in visa requirements, it incorrectly characterized the measure as being directed against Turkey. Sources from the Turkish Foreign Ministry and several reports say the requirement for visas by Turkish holders of diplomatic passports is part of a broader UK policy toward all diplomatic passport holders worldwide.\n\nFrom March 11, 2025 the UK government is introducing a simplified visa application without a personal appearance, fingerprinting or fees for holders of diplomatic passports, which will be separate from the general Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) system.\n\nStarting April 2, 2025, passport holders coming from visa-exempt countries like the European Union and the United States will need an ETA to travel to the UK.\n\nThis is part of an update to UK regulations that will force visa-free travelers to seek electronic pre-travel consent before their trips. The regime, scheduled for full operation in April 2025, allows security screenings to be carried out on tourists.\n\nThe ETA is not a visa as such, but another layer of pre-travel security to guarantee that non-visa nationals will be in conformity with the new UK immigration rules.\n\nThis will not affect the exempt status of accredited diplomats and embassy staff under international conventions.\n\n\u201cThe claim in some media outlets that \u2018The UK has announced that it will require visas from Turkish citizens holding diplomatic passports as of March 11\u2032 is manipulative. The application in question is not a step taken against our country but a part of the new UK worldwide border policy,\u201d Turkey\u2019s Directorate of Communications\u2019 Center for Countering Disinformation said in a statement posted on X.\n\n\u201cThe UK has introduced the program named Transforming Borders and Modernization and introduced the Universal Travel Authorization application. Under the mentioned application, it has introduced a pre-travel authorization requirement for all foreigners traveling to the UK,\u201d the center said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, as of March 11, 2025, an easy visa application has been introduced for all countries whose diplomatic passports are exempt from visas. In this context, diplomatic passport holders will be able to carry out visa procedures with a facilitated method, free of charge and without applying in person,\u201d it added.",

Of the initial applications in the pipeline, over 12,000 main applicants and 28,000 family members await processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data show that while authorities have now processed practically all applications from 2022, roughly half of applications filed in 2023, and 82% of those filed in 2024, still await processing.\n\nThese data suggest an average processing time of 18 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final quarter of 2024 saw an unprecedented surge in applications, which directly impacted processing capabilities.\n\nWhile the first three quarters of 2024 saw an average of 683 applications a month, the figure rose to 1,048 in the final quarter.\n\nDecember 2024 stood out particularly, recording the highest monthly application volume in two years. The program maintains a low rejection rate of approximately 2%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe processing data illustrate an expanding gap between applications and approvals throughout 2024. Authorities processed 4,536 applications during the year, marginally higher than the 4,441 processed in 2023, while receiving 10% more applications.\n\nOn average, authorities processed 378 applications monthly while receiving 774 new ones. Monthly processing volumes fluctuated between 246 and 537 applications, never matching the pace of incoming applications, which ranged from 550 to 1,137 per month.\n\nThe predominant share of applications processed in 2024 originated from submissions made in previous years due to the program's extensive backlog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreek authorities extended the deadline for property purchases under the old rule framework to February 28, 2025, aiming to safeguard approximately 750 million in investments already in the pipeline.\n\nCurrently, 16,307 valid golden visas circulate among main applicants, comprising 12,729 initial visas and 3,578 renewals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese investors continue to dominate the program, holding 56% of both initial visas and renewals. Turkish investors rank second, accounting for 8% of initial visas and 5% of renewals, followed by Lebanese investors at 5% for both categories.\n\nRussian investors maintain their position with 4% of all valid golden visas, but are limited to renewals since Greece suspended Russian applications in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority (82%) of the 15,420 main applicants awaiting initial golden visas or renewals applied in Attica, followed by 5% in Central and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, and 5% across Peloponnese, Western Greece, and the Ionian Islands.\n\nAccording to Katerina Saranti of MIBS Group, Greece is trying to reduce its golden visa processing time to three months by decentralizing applications from Athens to regional authorities, though investors must renew permits at their original application location.\n\nThe data support Saranti's claims, as only six months ago, 90% of applications were in Attica. The drop in percentage suggest that the government is offloading case volume to other regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If warranted, such reports could lead to the removal of \u201calien students and staff\u201d.\n\nWhile US institutions are required to report to immigration services any information deemed relevant to student visa determinations, federal efforts to impose an obligation to investigate and report on students are unprecedented and would raise serious legal questions, according to O\u2019Melveny law practice.\n\nThe measures have alarmed many students and faculty on colleges campuses, but experts have said that the directive would likely draw legal challenges for violating free speech rights protected by the Constitution.\n\nThe American Jewish Committee (AJC) issued a statement welcoming the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to \u201ccombatting antisemitism vigorously\u201d.\n\nStudent visa holders \u201cwho have been found to provide material support or resources to designated terror organisations \u2013 as defined by the Supreme Court and distinguished from the exercise of free speech \u2013 are clearly in violation of the law and are therefore unworthy of the privilege of being in this country,\u201d said AJC.\n\nHowever, many pro-Palestinian protesters denied supporting Hamas, saying that they were demonstrating against Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 47,000, according to health authorities.\n\nIn a letter representing students from the University of California\u2019s 10 campuses, students argued that the order inaccurately conflated \u201cpro-Palestine advocacy with antisemitism\u201d and set a \u201cscary precedent of censorship for the student community\u201d.\n\nThe threat of visas being revoked and students being removed was heightened after legislation was passed earlier this month allowing immigration officers to carry out raids in \u201csensitive locations\u201d including churches, schools and college campuses that were formerly protected.",

            "content": "Q : Can you elaborate on the improved outlook and whether the growth rates are expected to sustain? A : Christopher Suh, Visa Inc's CFO, mentioned that they feel great about the Q1 results. However, they are only one quarter into the year and will provide more updates on the second half as they get closer to it.\n\nThe regulatory environment in the US remains uncertain, which could impact Visa Inc ( NYSE:V )'s operations and growth strategies.\n\nVisa Inc ( NYSE:V ) faces potential challenges from a strong US dollar, which could affect cross-border travel and spending patterns.\n\nThe restructuring charge of $213 million related to workforce changes indicates ongoing adjustments and potential disruptions.\n\nOperating expenses grew 11%, driven by increases in personnel and general and administrative expenses, which could impact profitability.\n\nVisa Inc ( NYSE:V ) successfully renewed and expanded several key partnerships globally, including with ICBC in China and ICICI Bank in India, strengthening its international presence.\n\nVisa Inc ( NYSE:V ) reported a strong start to the fiscal year with $9.5 billion in net revenue, up 10% year over year, and EPS up 14%.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript .\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: What factors contributed to the stronger spending results, particularly during the holiday season? A: Christopher Suh explained that the US saw a strong holiday season, benefiting discretionary categories like retail, travel, and entertainment. The lapping of previous impacts also contributed to the step-up in spending. Cross-border e-commerce and travel volumes also showed strong growth.\n\nQ: How do you view the potential impact of tariffs on commercial and consumer spending? A: Ryan McInerney, Visa Inc's CEO, stated that they haven't seen any direct impact related to tariffs. It's difficult to predict what will be implemented, and they will assess the impact on their business as more information becomes available.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the strategy and potential monetization of tokenization? A: Ryan McInerney highlighted that Visa's tokenization strategy is a significant investment priority. Tokens improve transaction performance and enable innovation. Visa offers services like token credential enrichment and issuer heat maps, which generate revenue and will continue to grow in importance.\n\nQ: What is the outlook for Asia Pacific, given its lagging growth compared to other regions? A: Christopher Suh noted that Asia Pacific's growth is moderately up from Q4 but still reflects a somewhat muted environment. The region is growing at 1% in total, indicating a need for further improvement.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

The employment-based limit is calculated as 140,000 plus the number of family-based green cards that went unused the prior year, if any. The family-based category4 is slightly different. The limit is calculated as 480,000 minus the number of immediate relatives5 who were admitted the prior year, plus the number of employment-based green cards that went unused the prior year. If the immediate relative reduction is significantly high, the statute provides a 226,000 minimum/floor, ensuring that the numerical limit will not be below that amount.\n\nWhen the process works, Congress\u2019 intent to eventually use all allocated green cards is accomplished, as remaining unused visa numbers roll back and forth year after year until there are no unused green cards left.",

            "content": "Canada\u2019s Temporary Foreign Worker Programme (TFWP) is designed in a way that facilitates shocking abuse and discrimination of migrant workers, Amnesty International said in a new report today.\n\nThe report, \u2018Canada has destroyed me\u2019: Labour exploitation of migrant workers in Canada, exposes the impact of the TFWP, which allows employers to hire migrant workers, primarily for low-paid jobs, across various sectors, including agriculture, food processing, the care system, construction and hospitality. TFWP visas tie workers to a single employer who controls both their migration status and labour conditions.\n\nPeople who currently employed or have worked under the programme told Amnesty International that, after arriving in Canada, they were forced to work long hours without rest and received lower pay than agreed. they were often assigned tasks not included in their contract and suffered physical, sexual and psychological abuse. Many of them worked in unsafe conditions, lacked access to adequate housing and healthcare, and faced discrimination in the workplace. Most of them were unable to access effective remedies for the abuses they endured.\n\n\u201cThe abuse experienced by migrant workers in Canada is deeply troubling, especially for a country that claims to be a leader when it comes to protecting human rights,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Senior Director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns at Amnesty International. \u201cMany migrant workers have told us they came to Canada hoping to secure a better future, yet instead, they felt they were treated like slaves. These workers are vital for putting food on the country\u2019s tables and caring for the elderly. They deserve much better.\u201d\n\nMany migrant workers have told us they came to Canada hoping to secure a better future, yet instead, they felt they were treated like slaves. These workers are vital for putting food on the country\u2019s tables and caring for the elderly. They deserve much better. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Senior Director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns at Amnesty International.\n\nMany migrant workers under the TFWP work and live in remote locations and therefore depend on their employer for accommodation and access to health insurance or transportation to get medical care. They face termination of their contracts and a swift repatriation if they fall sick, suffer injuries or are no longer considered fit for the job.\n\nExploited and abused\n\nBenedicte, a woman from Cameroon, suffered racist psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of her employer as soon as she arrived in Canada in 2016 with a two-year tied visa to work on a farm. She was made to work 70\u201380-hour weeks performing tasks including domestic work, was substantially underpaid, and was constantly controlled. Her employer deceived her, promising to bring her children to Canada, to continue exploiting her. She eventually fell sick and was diagnosed with severe anaemia. When she finally left the farm in July 2018, her employer cancelled her visa, leaving her with an irregular migration status. \u201cI did not expect to be a slave here,\u201d she told Amnesty International.\n\nMost of the 44 workers interviewed by Amnesty International reported unpaid wages and excessive working hours. Some contracts seen by Amnesty International stipulated zero rest days. Some workers reported being subjected to racist language by their employers and supervisors, including being called \u201cdonkey\u201d, \u201cIndian\u201d, or \u201cshitty Mexican.\u201d A Jamaican woman said her supervisor told her to \u201cgo back to the tree you came from\u201d and a few reported being physically assaulted by their employers. Many lived in inadequate housing, and a few said they did not even have drinkable water in their accommodation. Some workers suffered severe injuries or developed medical conditions as a result of unsafe working conditions. Workers reported being threatened with repatriation by their employers, and in a few cases, were taken to the airport against their will.\n\nMany workers reported suffering discrimination at work, including by being tasked with the hardest physical jobs, which they could not refuse. Women reported gender-based violence and discrimination. For instance, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Sylvie* (not their real names), two Ivorian nationals working in a nursing home, told Amnesty International they had to commit to pay the recruitment fees incurred by their agency in Ivory Coast and the employer in Canada in case they failed to comply with their \u201ccommitments.\u201d These included not being pregnant at the time of departure, not getting pregnant and not abandoning the employment before their two-year contract ended.\n\nNo adequate remedy for abuses\n\nMany workers fail to report the abuses they suffer out of fear of reprisals including unfair dismissal, non-renewal of their contract, and repatriation. Those who do complain are faced with Canada\u2019s complex enforcement system, which is not designed to protect individuals with precarious status, who often don\u2019t have time to engage in proceedings or who may not be able to navigate bureaucratic systems in either of Canada\u2019s official languages.\n\nFor example, Walter arrived in Canada to work in agriculture on a two-year tied visa, but was subjected to long working hours and was not provided with the necessary protective equipment. He was also banned from eating, drinking or taking a break except during transportation. Eventually, the owner of an unauthorized placement agency deceived Walter and several of his co-workers into believing he could help them change jobs lawfully. For a year, he lived in the basement of the owner of the placement agency and was not allowed to leave except to work on jobs that the agent arranged for him.\n\n\u201cMy work permit and work almost killed me \u2026 If we did not obey, we would be deported,\u201d he told Amnesty International.\n\nWalter has not yet received adequate redress for the severe abuses he suffered.\n\nSystemic discrimination\n\nUnlike other temporary labour schemes in Canada, TFWP visas don\u2019t allow migrants to change employers. TFWP visas are mostly granted to \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers from low- and middle-income countries in the Global South, with a majority of Black, Latin American and other racialized populations. In 2023, the top countries of origin of TFWP workers were Mexico, India, Philippines, Guatemala and Jamaica, together representing almost 70% of the work permits granted.\n\n\u201cLabour exploitation of migrant workers under Canada\u2019s temporary visa programme is not the result of just a few unscrupulous employers. Instead, the programme has been designed in a way that enables abuses against the migrant workers,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas.\n\nLabour exploitation of migrant workers under Canada\u2019s temporary visa programme is not the result of just a few unscrupulous employers.

Erika Guevara-Rosas, Senior Director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns at Amnesty International.\n\nMoreover, \u201clow-skilled\u201d and racialized workers are subjected to a high risk of labour exploitation for long periods of time, as many continue travelling to Canada year after year, with little prospect of obtaining a more secure status, due to Canada\u2019s immigration system which privileges \u201chigh-skilled\u201d workers for permanent residence.\n\n\u201cCanadian authorities are well aware of the abuses that take place under the TFWP, yet they have implemented very limited measures to address some of the abuses, such as increasing inspections,\u201d said Guevara-Rosas.\n\nCanadian authorities are well aware of the abuses that take place under the TFWP, yet they have implemented very limited measures to address some of the abuses, such as increasing inspections. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Senior Director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns at Amnesty International.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that labour exploitation is a foreseeable and systemic result of tied visas. Any reform that fails to abolish tied visas and replace them with open work permits fails to address the root causes of the abuses and will fall short of complying with Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations. Migrant workers should have the freedom to change jobs and employers, just as Canadians are.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nCanada\u2019s TFWP was launched in 1973 to allow employers to bring foreign workers to Canada on a temporary basis, although the first migrant workers began arriving from the Caribbean in the 1960s. The program has gone through several reforms but tied visas have remained a fundamental component over the years. In 2024, the Canadian government adopted additional reforms to reduce the number of migrants in the country and the length of TFWP visas.\n\nFor more information or to arrange an interview, please contact: [email protected]",

Visa reposted the announcement, confirming that X Money users will be able to fund and transfer money using their debit card with Visa Direct.\n\nWhen Musk acquired X (then known as Twitter) in 2022, he said he planned to turn it into an \"everything app\" to offer multiple services.\n\nHere's what the news could mean for you.\n\nWill you need an X account to use X Money?\n\nChances are you'll need an X account to use X Money, similar to needing an Apple account to access Apple Pay or Apple Cash.\n\nThe push for X account membership to access X Money could also be part of the effort to attract more users to the platform.\n\nThe platform has lost millions of users since the tech billionaire bought the social media platform, and more recently, since Musk aligned with President Donald Trump.

X Money could make it more convenient for creators on the platform to receive payments directly from the app.\n\nHowever, other details are still unclear, including how secure your banking data is or any fees for transferring money to your bank account. Some peer-to-peer apps also charge other fees, such as instant transfer and withdrawal fees.\n\nWill you be able to transfer crypto using X Money?\n\nMusk has been a proponent of Dogecoin, but there's been no mention of crypto being available on X Money at this time.\n\nCrypto transactions could be separate from X Money and Visa transactions, but there's still a chance, depending on X's plans.\n\nWhen will X Money be available?\n\nEven though Yaccarino announced that Visa is X Money's first digital wallet partner, we shouldn't expect an official launch for a while.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge last night's tragic air collision in Washington, D.C. Our hearts go out to all those affected by this terrible event, particularly the families and friends of the victims.\n\nTurning now to our results. We had a strong start to our fiscal year with $9.5 billion in net revenue, up 10% year over year, and EPS up 14%. Our key business drivers improved from the fourth quarter. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 9% year over year.\n\nU.S. payments volume grew 7% and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 16% in constant dollars, and processed transactions grew 11% year over year. Our strategy across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services continues to resonate with our clients and is reflected in our business results.\n\nBack in February 2020, when we articulated our strategy, our total first-quarter volume on our network had just crossed $3 trillion. Just five years later, our total quarterly volume was above $4 trillion. At the same time, CEMEA and Latin America had more volume from people using their cards to get cash than to make payments. Five years later, as a result of double-digit constant dollar payments volume growth in both regions, the situation has flipped, and we now have more than 60% of our volume from digital payments.\n\nI'm looking forward to our Investor Day next month to discuss our strategy and our plans for future growth. For now, let's look at some of the quarterly highlights that have helped to deliver this impressive progress. In consumer payments, we now have 4.7 billion credentials, up 7% year over year, and 12.6 billion tokens, up 44% year over year. We continue to grow our credentials in an increasingly digital world.\n\nInterest in our Visa flexible credential continues to grow. We have now launched with the Affirm card in the U.S., expanded the funding options with SMCC in Japan by adding small business cards, and announced a multicurrency solution with fintech Liv in the U.A.E. Tap to add card is now live in the U.S. for nearly 60% of all Visa consumer credit and debit cards.\n\nSince the launch, millions have added their cards to their wallets by tapping, eliminating the overwhelming majority of provisioning fraud as compared to manual entry into a phone. And 74% of all face-to-face transactions are now tap to pay. A few countries I would like to call out, Japan, where tap-to-pay penetration grew 20 percentage points since last year to 44%; Argentina, where tap-to-pay penetration was up 22 percentage points to 78%; and the U.S., where it was up 13 percentage points to 57%. Several key initiatives contributed to the growth in these countries, including targeted marketing campaigns, the launch of transit acceptance in certain cities, and increased issuance of tap-to-pay-enabled credentials.\n\nFinally, tap to phone is now live in 118 markets. And in the last year, the number of phones enabled has more than doubled and the number of transactions has more than tripled. Now, let me turn to a few deal highlights from across the globe. First, in Mainland China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in Mainland China in terms of number of cards.\n\nIn India, we renewed our long-standing credit agreements with ICICI Bank, SBI Card, and Kotak Mahindra Bank, three of our largest issuers in the country with a focus on growing affluent and cross-border volume. We also renewed our debit agreement with Kotak Mahindra Bank. Also, in our Asia Pacific region, we signed a long-term renewal with Bank of New Zealand, one of the largest banks in the country across consumer debit, consumer credit, and business credit. In Argentina and Uruguay, we renewed our portfolios with Santander for a long-term agreement with a focus on growing affluent.\n\nAlso in Latin America, we have deepened our partnership with BAC to grow acceptance with a goal to enable 300,000 nano and small merchants and to grow in new verticals. We also won the issuance of their largely cross-border credit portfolio, Millas Plus, offering our expertise and value-added services. Similarly, in Brazil, we extended our partnership with digital bank Neon, which includes the launch of a new credit portfolio. We are also pleased to have renewed a pan-European agreement with BNP Paribas, which also includes the winning of additional portfolios in France and Belgium.\n\nWhen we talk about the total addressable opportunity in consumer payments, we often talk about the opportunity to win share from domestic networks, and we are continuing to have success converting credentials from domestic networks to Visa. In Bangladesh, we secured nearly 6 million credentials with Dutch Bangla Bank from their closed-loop system. And Banco Popular Puerto Rico, the largest issuer and acquirer in Puerto Rico, renewed a multiyear credit and debit partnership with Visa that aims to expand digital penetration in the country through the launch of new products, including a co-badge card with the local network. And we've renewed our business with RBC Royal Bank in 10 countries across the Caribbean, and we also expanded our relationship to include the transfer of debit credentials in the Dutch Caribbean to Visa and are supporting the development of new credit and commercial products.\n\nAnd co-brand cards remain a key area of strength for us, and this quarter was no exception. In India, we launched two very important cards. First, the Times Black ICICI Bank credit card, catering to high-net-worth individuals with travel and lifestyle benefits. Second, the HSBC Taj credit card, India's first premium co-branded hospitality credit card.\n\nIn our CEMEA region, we signed with real estate developer, investor, and manager, Aldar for a co-brand card for its Darna Rewards by Aldar loyalty program in the U.A.E. with issuing bank Emirates NBD. We also launched a new co-brand card in Saudi Arabia with Alrajhi Bank and Marriott Bonvoy, the global travel program by Marriott International. In the airline category, we won the portfolio for EGYPTAIR, Africa's second-largest airline.\n\nWe also expanded our business in the SWISS card Miles & More program. And in the retail segment, we signed with Casas Bahia, one of the top retailers in Brazil for co-brand cards; and with Volt, a leading ride-hailing and food delivery operator in Ukraine. So, through traditional issuance, winning share from domestic networks, and leveraging our brand products and innovation to secure important co-brands, our consumer payments business is strong. Now, to new flows, where revenue grew 19% year over year in constant dollars.\n\nVisa Direct has now crossed the $10 billion transaction mark over the last 12 months with nearly 3 billion transactions this quarter. We continue to expand Visa Direct in several ways, one of which is building and deepening partnerships directly with issuers and fintechs. We are excited to partner with X Money for their much-anticipated launch of the X Money account, including P2P payment functionality set for later this year. Through the partnership, X Money will utilize Visa Direct to enable secure and instant funding of their X wallet with a user's debit card.\n\nUsers will also have the option to instantly transfer funds back into their bank account via the same debit card. This quarter, we signed an agreement with OnePay, a fintech company with more than 3 million monthly active users for Visa Direct as the engine for wallet loads. In Ecuador, Banco Pichincha, one of the country's largest issuers, will begin using Visa Direct for cross-border remittance payments. Our broad and deep cross-border capabilities continue to be important differentiators.\n\nAnd this quarter, Libra Internet Bank in Romania launched a real-time multicurrency FX service for their business customers utilizing our Currencycloud solution. In Asia Pacific, OCBC has launched a cross-border P2P solution on the OCBC app, allowing their customers in Singapore to send money to Chinese wallets using Visa Direct. All they need is the recipient's China national ID name and mobile number. Now, moving to Commercial, where volumes were up 6% year over year this quarter in constant dollars.\n\nWe had some notable progress in specific verticals. First, in the food and grocery delivery vertical, we had two recent wins. In the U.S., we are pleased that DoorDash's shopper card program will soon be using Visa virtual commercial credit cards to enable Dashers to pay for customer orders at physical merchant outlets. This is in addition to our Visa Direct relationship with DoorDash in the U.S., Australia, and Canada to enable Dasher payouts.\n\nIn Brazil, we signed a commercial business card deal for commercial customers of iFood Pago, the fintech for the largest food delivery platform in the country. In the healthcare vertical, we reached a virtual card agreement with an insurtech company in France, mySofie, offering medical policyholders an easy way to pay for their healthcare. In the T&E vertical, we recently renewed and deepened our partnership with Airwallex, a global financial platform enabling more than 150,000 businesses to manage payments and money movement across borders. Today, Visa and Airwallex have live card programs in Australia, Hong Kong, the U.K., United States, Canada, Netherlands, and Singapore to enable businesses to easily make digital card payments around the world.\n\nAnd soon, we will be expanding to new geographies across our use cases in expense cards and B2B travel. In both Visa Direct and Commercial, we continued to develop innovative new solutions and use cases that helped us retain and secure business. Now, to value-added services, where in the first quarter, revenue grew 18% in constant dollars. Across our solutions, we continue to grow revenue as we enhance Visa payments, enable services for all types of payments, and go beyond payments.\n\nWe often partner with acquirers who utilize Visa's Acceptance Platform to offer their merchant clients compelling solutions. When this happens, we generate revenue on both Visa and non-Visa transactions. Three examples this quarter are European acquirer emerchantpay, Guatemalan acquirer NeoNet, and Paraguayan acquirer Bancard, who will all offer CyberSource to their merchants. We are also partnering with Fiserv to include our CyberSource gateway as a solution for their acquirers and merchants in Europe and Asia Pacific.\n\nThis is in addition to Fiserv expanding their use of cardholder authentication from CardinalCommerce to further extend our global partnership into additional Fiserv platforms. In our risk solutions, in 2024, we launched Visa Protect for A2A payments with plans to expand to 10 new RTP networks in 2025. Powered by AI-based fraud detection models, this new service provides a real-time risk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments. We are now piloting the solution with five significant players in Brazil, who represent more than 20% of Pix transactions.\n\nWe are also very pleased to have closed our acquisition of Featurespace, enabling us to provide an expanded set of fraud prevention tools to our clients and protect consumers in real time across various payment methods. In advisory services, we continue to see strong demand. One example of a recent project is with Alrajhi Bank, where we are expanding our advisory relationship into risk, digital enablement, and data analysis across their portfolios. So, across our value-added services portfolio, we are innovating with new solutions and deepening our partnerships with clients to drive growth.\n\nTo wrap it up, we began our fiscal year with strong performance, an ever-growing obsession for our clients, and a focus on continued innovation as we build the future of payments. I look forward to seeing you in February at our Investor Day. And now, over to Chris.\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflected improving underlying drivers and effective execution of our business. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year over year; and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 16% year over year.\n\nProcessed transactions grew 11% year over year. Fiscal first-quarter net revenue was up 10%, higher than our expectations, primarily due to strong international transaction revenue and value-added services revenue. Net revenue was up 11% in constant dollars. EPS was up 14% year over year and 15% in constant dollars, higher than expected, primarily due to revenue outperformance and a lower-than-expected tax rate.\n\nNow, let's go into the details. In the U.S., total payments volume grew 7% year over year, up two points from Q4. Credit grew 7% and debit grew 8%. The U.S.\n\nbenefited from a strong holiday shopping season, which is the period from November 1 to December 31, and the lapping of the impact of Reg II implementations, which had a modest drag in Q1 of last year. In the U.S., consumer holiday spending growth was in the upper mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. The consumer categories with the strongest growth were discretionary categories such as retail, travel, and entertainment. Focusing on retail, holiday spending growth was a couple of points higher than last year and retail spending growth on key shopping days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was several points higher.\n\nE-commerce was a higher share of retail holiday spending versus last year. In key countries around the globe, we saw similar trends, with consumer retail holiday spending growth improving from last year. Moving to international markets. Total payments volume was up 11% in constant dollars, up from Q4.\n\nIn most of our regions, payments volume year-over-year growth rates in constant dollars were strong for the quarter, with Latin America up 22%, CEMEA up 18%, and Europe up 13%. Asia Pacific payments volume growth saw a slight improvement from Q4 in constant dollars to just above 1% year over year for the quarter, reflecting a still somewhat muted macroeconomic environment. Now, to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year over year in Q1, three points above Q4.\n\nE-commerce measured as card-not-present volume ex travel and cross-border travel volume were both up 16% year over year for Q1. E-commerce volumes continued to benefit from the strength in retail, in part due to the strong holiday shopping season. Travel volumes performed well across our regional corridors due to broader strength in both consumer and commercial spending. Outbound Europe and Asia Pacific travel volume growth also benefited from solid performance of client portfolios.\n\nFor the U.S., both outbound e-commerce and travel volume growth were also helped by the strong dollar. Now, let's review our first quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year over year versus the 8% growth in Q4 constant dollars payments volume.\n\nData processing revenue grew 9% versus 11% processed transaction growth due largely to the back half-loaded 2025 pricing impact that was included in our initial guidance. Had pricing been more evenly spread across the year as in the prior year, these two growth metrics would have been more in line for the first quarter. International transaction revenue was better than expected, benefiting from higher cross-border volumes and higher currency volatility than we expected. Year-over-year growth was up 14%, below the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, due primarily to foreign exchange and lapping higher currency volatility from last year.\n\nOther revenue grew 32%, primarily driven by better-than-expected consulting and marketing services growth and select pricing modifications. Client incentives grew 13%, reflecting a strong renewal quarter. Now, to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue growth was driven by improving payments volume, cross-border volume, and process transaction growth.\n\nNew flows revenue grew 19% year over year in constant dollars driven by better-than-expected commercial cross-border performance across all regions and Visa Direct transaction growth. Commercial payments volume rose 6% year over year in constant dollars, mainly driven by favorable days mix impact as well as strong cross-border volumes. Visa Direct transactions grew 34% year over year, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Value-added services revenue grew to $2.4 billion, a growth rate of 18% in constant dollars, led by strong growth in consulting and marketing services, Issuing Solutions, and Risk and Identity Solutions.\n\nOperating expenses grew 11%, in line with our expectations, driven by increases in personnel and general and administrative expenses. In our GAAP results, we had $213 million in severance costs related to changes to our workforce, reflecting our efforts to focus investment on the highest growth opportunities for our business as well as accelerating our innovation to better serve our clients. Our tax rate was 17.7%, better than expected due to various items, including a change in our geographic mix of earnings. EPS was $2.75, up 14% over last year, with an approximately one-point drag from exchange rates and an approximately half-point drag from acquisitions.\n\nIn Q1, we bought back approximately $3.9 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of December, we had $9.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in Q2. Through January 28, driver trends have remained strong.\n\nU.S. payments volume was up 8%, with debit up 9% and credit up 7% year over year. Processed transactions grew 11% year over year. For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, we saw total volume grew 17% year over year, travel-related cross-border volume grew 17% year over year, and cross-border card-not-present ex-travel volume grew 16%.\n\nNow, on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted net revenue growth to be in the high single digits to low double digits.\n\nI would note that the primary difference between Q1 and Q2 adjusted net revenue growth is the lapping of leap year. We expect second-quarter adjusted operating expense growth to be in the high single to low double digits. Nonoperating income in the second quarter is expected to be negligible. And our tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be around 17.5%.\n\nAs a result, we expect second-quarter adjusted EPS growth to be in the high single digits. We have now closed the acquisition of Featurespace and lapped the impact of Pismo in January. For acquisition impacts, we expect a minimal impact to net revenue growth, and approximately 1.5-point contribution to operating expense growth, and an approximately half-point headwind to EPS growth in the second quarter. Now, let's cover our full-year expectations.\n\nWe now expect full-year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low double digits. There are no material changes to our adjusted operating expense growth and nonoperating income expectations for the full year. Based on our lower-than-expected tax rate in Q1 and an updated view for the rest of the year, we're lowering our expected tax rate to be between 17.5% and 18%. Taking all of this together, we now expect adjusted EPS growth to be in the low teens.\n\nFeaturespace and Pismo are expected to have a minimal impact on full-year net revenue growth and approximately one-point contribution to operating expense growth and an approximately half-point headwind to EPS growth. In summary, we're off to a strong start to the year. We remain focused on the execution of our growth strategy for the rest of 2025 and look forward to Investor Day in a few weeks. And now, Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani -- Analyst\n\nThank you. I had a question on the improved outlook. Obviously, the volumes did better and they accelerated. Does the improved outlook assume the growth rates sort of sustain themselves? Or maybe you could just go through sort of what the drivers are.\n\nThanks.\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Hi, Sanjay. Thanks for the question. Yes, we feel great about the Q1 results.\n\nAs I indicated -- one quarter in the year, and we'll have more of an update on Half 2 as we get closer to it.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Nance -- Analyst\n\nHey, guys, I appreciate you taking the question. I also wanted to follow up on some of the stronger spending results that you've seen. You called out the strong results. That's been pretty evident in some of the prints so far this quarter.\n\nI just wanted to know if there's anything kind of when you peel back the onion in some of the data that you guys have, if there's anything obvious that you would attribute this acceleration over the past couple of months toward? I know you called out some things around holiday spending. And obviously, there's been a lot of days mix things going on. But we spent, I think, a year talking about ticket size being a headwind. So, I'm wondering how much of this is sort of a new run rate and lapping kind of tougher comps over the last couple of years versus kind of an outright acceleration and kind of spending above trend.\n\nCurious if you have any thoughts on that. Thanks.\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Will. Well, let's try to break down, unpack a little bit a few things in there. We talked about strength in the U.S.\n\nand international markets. The strength in the U.S., we did have a strong holiday. I gave some of those numbers in the prepared comments that you heard about. It also helped discretionary categories, retail, travel, and entertainment, and then the lapping of Reg II.\n\nThat was really the step-up that we saw in the U.S. We feel really good about that and then like we talked about as well across the regions. And so, from a payment volume standpoint, I feel really good about that. Cross-border, maybe the added commentary on cross-border was, if you look at e-commerce, e-commerce was up one point from Q4, cross-border e-commerce benefiting from the stronger retail and holiday.\n\nAnd then travel, though, did step up by four points from Q4, and not just Q4 but maybe the last two quarters, which had been around that same level. We're seeing strong travel results across all the regions. And so, again, we feel really good about that. But all that said, it's a quarter into the year, and we're going to obviously wait to see how Q2 plays out, but we feel pretty good about the outlook into the second quarter.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller -- Analyst\n\nGuys, thanks. Just a couple, two parts to a question. But first one is really to do with the underlying trends we're going to see through the year with regard to the moving parts on some of your easier lapping given that there were some business, as you talked about, that had come off last year that lapse. How does that impact your volume trajectory in the U.S.? As the year progresses, we can think about that.\n\nObviously, Reg II started to help already. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on rebates incentives. I know you talked about this being the higher quarter that we were going to start the year off at. Maybe just if you could help us, was this in line with your expectations in terms of the results that we saw? Or is anything changing around timing on it? Or did it really come in as expected? Thanks again, guys.\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nOK. Let me try to tackle all three of those things, Darrin. In terms of the full-year guide, you are recalling correctly. When we started the year, we talked about sort of the dynamics in Half 1 and Half 2 and why we anticipated growth to be accelerating throughout the course of the year.\n\nIncentives was part of that story. As we said before, as expected, this is going to be a big year for renewals, with more than 20% of our payment volume impacted and starting really meaningfully with that renewal cycle in the first half of the year. That has occurred. You saw incentives grow 13% in Q1 versus the 6% we saw in Q4.\n\nThat will continue. We anticipate Q2 incentives growth will continue to reflect that renewal cycle. You mentioned Reg II. I think we've covered that.\n\nWe are lapping what was modest impact from a year ago. And then there are some lapping benefits from portfolio as well that are more centered toward the second half of the year as well. That all said, again, I have said it before, to the last question when Will asked, it's a quarter into the year. We reflected the Q1 upside and adjusted our Q2 outlook to reflect that, and we'll certainly talk about Half 2 as we get closer to it.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Andrew Jeffrey with William Blair. You may go ahead.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nAndrew, are you there? Operator, maybe we can go to the next caller and come back to Andrew in a bit.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment, please. Andrew, you may go ahead, sir.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you. Can you hear me now?\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nYes. Now, we can.\n\nAndrew Jeffrey -- Analyst\n\nI apologize for that. I'm sorry. I wanted to ask on value-added services given the recent closure of Featurespace and I think some emphasis in Pismo. Can you talk, Ryan, has there been a philosophical change, or a change in emphasis perhaps, in Visa's value-added services initiatives? And going forward, as we think about greater opportunities in that area, should we think about Visa maybe emphasizing some more security offerings versus processing and gateway? Just trying to frame that up.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. We continue to be very excited about the progress that we're making in value-added services across the board. There's no change in emphasis as it relates to the priority or the prioritization of kind of the areas where we've been building products and serving clients. So, we continue to be very focused on delivering solutions to merchants and acquirers, very focused on delivering solutions to issuers, very focused on delivering fraud and risk solutions broadly across the ecosystem as well as our advisory business.\n\nI talked about some examples in my prepared remarks. We have had some great acquisitions. The way that we think about acquisitions is we're constantly kind of looking for companies around the world that we can bring into our ecosystem, accelerate their growth, accelerate our kind of products that we're bringing to our clients. And Pismo and Featurespace are two great examples of those.\n\nIn terms of Pismo, we're having real good success kind of with our sales pipeline all around the world. We're having conversations with clients that I don't think Pismo ever would have had, certainly not this early in their evolution. And the reason we're able to do that is we're bringing kind of the amazing capabilities that Pismo offers together with the deep relationships and partnerships that we have as well as kind of our long track record of delivering resilient solutions to our clients and partners. Featurespace is early, but we're already having a ton of success.\n\nI got a ton of great client and partner feedback once we closed that acquisition. We've known Featurespace for many, many years. We partnered with them. We also competed against them.\n\nWe know their capabilities really, really well. One of the things that you're seeing from us is that we're continuing to take the amazing capabilities that we have at Visa, whether that's our fraud capabilities, our network capabilities, our processing capabilities, we're unbundling those from the Visa stack, we're enhancing them, and then we're delivering them to a broader array of clients and partners many times unrelated to Visa transactions or the VisaNet platform itself. So, we continue to focus on all those areas in value-added service. We continue to have good success, and you'll continue to see us kind of move down this kind of program of unbundling our capabilities, enhancing them, and delivering them to a much broader set of clients.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. You may go ahead.\n\nHarshita Rawat -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon. So, Ryan, I want to follow up on your comments on kind of this unbundling of the capabilities and ask about Visa A2A. You talked about 10 new RTP network partnerships. What are you hearing from your issuer and merchant customers? Bill Pay is probably an obvious use case.\n\nHow should we think about the road map of use cases, monetization models, and also the dynamics vis-a-vis debit in terms of cannibalization? Thank you.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. You're right. Kind of this notion of unbundling our capabilities is very relevant in the value-added services space for some of the reasons that I mentioned. It's also very relevant in the consumer payment space.\n\nAnd Visa account-to-account is a great example, a great example where we've unbundled kind of our brand and acceptance, our rules in terms of charge-backs, disputes, and returns and how things work, as well as kind of our risk management capabilities. We've unbundled that from the Visa stack, and now we're delivering that to our partners initially in the U.K. with Visa A2A and then more broadly across Europe and other places over time. We still are on track to launch Visa A2A in early 2025.\n\nAfter we announced it, we've done what we always do, which is have a bunch of great conversations with clients and partners and regulators in the U.K. As you mentioned, the initial use case is targeted at Bill Pay. And what we found through those conversations is there's a real need. There's a real need to add the types of processes and rules and the trusted brand that we have to account-to-account payments, starting in Bill Pay, to give consumers more confidence to use it, merchants more reason and confidence to offer it.\n\nAnd we're excited about it. I mean, obviously, Bill Pay in U.K. is just the start. But we think that the power of kind of taking some of these Visa capabilities into the account-to-account space is going to be a great benefit for our clients and our partners in the ecosystem.\n\nYou mentioned Visa account-to-account. It's a similar story kind of on what we've been doing in account-to-account protect, where we've taken our kind of decades of risk experience, our data, our scoring algorithms and unbundled that from kind of the Visa stack, and we're delivering that to, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're targeting up to 10 RTP networks during the course of this year. I mentioned the banks we're now working with in Brazil to reduce fraud on Pix transactions. We've had great success with Pay.UK in the U.K., reducing fraud on account-to-account transactions.\n\nAnd you're going to hear a lot more from other partners and other networks around the world. These two examples are both driven by client needs. I mean, that is what drives our innovation agenda. That's what drives our product delivery agenda.\n\nWe've been hearing from clients all around the world that they're looking for Visa to help them with these types of challenges, both driving safe and secure account-to-account payments around the world. So, very excited about it, and you'll continue to hear more from us on it.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next caller is Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTimothy Chiodo -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you. I want to dig a little bit into the mix components of the cross-border business. So, you said in the past that roughly about 60% of it is travel and the other roughly 40% is e-commerce.\n\nAnd I know that evolved a little bit throughout COVID and now into the recovery period. But when we think about the e-commerce component, I believe that some of the Visa Direct-related pieces are sitting there, so whether it be the remittances that are cross-border or the marketplace payouts. I was hoping you could dig into those two or that broader bucket, if there's any rough growth rates or growth contribution or sizing. And if not, just any general comments around that aspect of the cross-border business.\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks for the question, Tim. Yes, let's unpack that as well. We've been doing some unpacking here. In terms of e-commerce, the mix that you've shared is the mix that we've shared in terms of travel and e-commerce, with e-commerce having sustained slightly better over the last few quarters.\n\nObviously, this quarter, the two growth rates converged. That was good to see. And within that, Visa Direct does have a cross-border component. We talked about Visa Direct transactions growing 34%.\n\nThe cross-border portion of that is growing much faster. It's obviously a small portion of the total transactions. It's growing much faster than that. And so, we continue to appreciate that.\n\nVisa Direct in total, the momentum is great and continues to be a really good opportunity. But yes, when you add it all together, we're seeing great growth across e-commerce and cross-border. And as you know, the yields are accretive as well.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. The only thing I'd add is that in the very big scheme of things, with all the success we're having in cross-border Visa Direct, which is great, and we are having great success, it's still a very small portion of our cross-border transactions and payment volume around the world in the big scheme of things.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks. I wanted to just follow up a little bit on the cross-border question. In the past, we've seen different periods when cryptocurrencies have done well, but that's also helped the cross-border kind of e-commerce component.\n\nI'm wondering how much of an uplift you saw from that. And I guess, tied in with that, as we've seen kind of growth rates decelerate a little bit here in January, what's your current visibility on particularly travel? And what are you seeing around bookings there? Any color you could provide on those two things would be great. Thanks.\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSure. Hi, James. Crypto, so how and where does crypto impact our business? Well, there are a few ways that crypto can show up in our underlying drivers. But typically, when we see an impact, we do see it in our cross-border e-commerce volumes.\n\nI talked about some of the drivers of that this quarter relative to Q4. But obviously, given the recent demand and sort of activity around crypto, it is a modest benefit, I would say, to our cross-border e-commerce, but it's one of the smaller benefits, I talked about sort of the other things that impact that. And so, that's where we do see it typically.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg -- Analyst\n\nThank you, guys. I wanted to touch on tokenization for a minute. I think you said number of tokens were up 44% in the quarter. Obviously, a pretty robust number.\n\nSo, if you can just give us a general update on tokenization strategy and any potential timing or magnitude of actual monetization opportunity from tokenization, obviously, understanding the benefits of it from a fraud and security perspective. But just wondering if there's any direct monetization we should be thinking about.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nHappy to talk about tokens. You did get the number right, and we agree that it's significant. Let me just step back and maybe put the whole token kind of road map in perspective. Visa network tokens have been and will be one of our most important investment priorities across the company.\n\nIn many ways, we led the wave of token innovation and adoption. I think it's been about a decade since we issued the first Visa token. I remember, I think in 2020, we got to 1 billion tokens. And that was a big milestone.\n\nBut in hindsight, like we were really just approaching the beginning of the steep part of the S curve. You go back to what you said about 44% growth, so we've now got more than 12.5 billion tokens across the ecosystem. We got 8,400 issuers around the world that are issuing them in 200-plus markets around the world. And we've got a third of all Visa transactions that are now tokenized.\n\nWe did 21 billion, 22 billion token transactions in the last quarter. And as you alluded to, the adoption is proliferating because the performance improvement is meaningful. If you just look at e-commerce, on tokenized transactions, we have six percentage point higher approval rates, that is significantly higher sales for our merchant partners; and 30% reduction in fraud rates, which is good for everybody in the ecosystem. Tokens have become one of our most important platforms for enabling innovation.\n\nFor example, I think it was last quarter, I talked about in Europe, we're using tokens to simplify the e-commerce checkout experience. We've embedded FIDO passkeys via Visa tokens into click-to-pay, and we're making e-commerce checkout as easy as it is that you and I unlock our phone with our face or fingerprint. So, that's an example of tokens being a platform to drive innovation around the world. They're also a critical enabler of our value-added services.\n\nAnd those, we deepen relationships with our partners, and we also grow revenue. To your question around monetization, what would be a couple of examples? We've got merchants that are using our token credential enrichment service. So, we embed this in Visa tokens so that we continually update Visa credentials for merchants that subscribe to this service. And then they don't have to worry about consumers updating their credentials when their cards expire, so they don't miss a subscription renewal or a sale, and we have revenue for that service.\n\nWe also offer a service, if you think about on the issuer side, that allows our issuers to create a heat map of all their consumers' tokens across the entire ecosystem. And they pay for this service from us so that they can enable their customers to add, view, and manage their Visa cards across merchants that they use in their daily lives. So, we have a vast array of services that we both ship and that we're building and plan to ship built on our tokens. And the revenue that we generate from these token-enabled services is meaningful, and it will be even more meaningful going forward.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, I just want to ask about X Money. How long does a project like that take for you guys to implement with X? Any kind of idea on how fast and how much volume that might ramp? And any thoughts on economics? I assume it's just kind of Visa Direct type transactions.\n\nThanks.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I think the X partnership is a great example in what's been a kind of long list of fintech and big tech, crypto, digital wallets, social messaging apps, and the like that have looked around at their options and concluded that the Visa platform, the Visa network and the Visa network of networks is kind of the best, most reliable, biggest money movement platform that's really engineered to enable their developers to quickly implement the types of solutions that they're looking to implement. And it's another great step in that journey that we've been taking. As you said, the partnership is built on the Visa Direct platform.\n\nIt's going to allow the 600 million or so active monthly users of X to fund their X Money accounts, so they move money into it. They're going to be able to transfer funds back to their bank account instantly from their X Money account. There's going to be creators on the X platform that can now get paid much faster when they use Visa Direct to move money back into their bank accounts. So, it's a great credit to the partnership between our team and the X Money team and I think building out those use cases, and we're just excited to continue to expand the number of use cases on our platform.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Dominick Gabriele from Compass Point. You may go ahead, please.\n\nDominick Gabriele -- Analyst\n\nHey, thanks so much for taking my question. I was actually just curious if you've heard through your partners on either the consumer or commercial side if the threat of tariffs pushed up any commercial spending or consumer spending, and if you've tracked that in the past. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. We haven't seen anything directly related to that. And I think just like, I guess, broadening the question a bit. I think on tariffs broadly, we're going to have to wait and see what happens.\n\nI think it's going to be very difficult to predict what's going to get implemented, where it's going to get implemented. And as we see these things potentially get implemented, we'll have a better sense on what impact it has for our business, and we can let you know then.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on commercial.\n\nSo, I think I got 6% growth, so a one-point improvement there quarter on quarter. Can you talk more about the trends in commercial spend in 1Q and further improvement expected or, I guess, sustainable here in the '25 outlook relative to what you saw in '24?\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks for the question. You got the numbers right. Commercial volumes were up from Q4, a little over one point. And that Q1 growth was aided by a couple of things: favorable days mix in the U.S.\n\nand internationally, which was the inverse of what I talked about in Q4 where days mix was a little bit of a headwind. I also referenced stronger commercial cross-border volumes as well. And maybe the third one, it's small, but there was less of a drag from ATS as it continues to evolve. I also referenced strong results from client portfolios that helped cross-border volumes in Europe and AP.\n\nThat also benefited commercial. This all contributed nicely to our strong new flows revenue performance. That is a trend, in terms of commercial volumes, that is embedded into our expectations, are embedded into our Q2 guidance. We anticipate they remain steady, stable, and strong through the remainder of the year.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Perlin -- Analyst\n\nThanks. I was wondering if you could just speak to the point around the strength of the dollar and really like the purchasing power parity associated with that. So, I guess, it plays into cross-border, obviously, for outbound U.S., but it's higher for people to come into the United States. But also, just in terms of just spending patterns, I mean, obviously, this is going to be a strong period for a little while and I'm just wondering to what extent there's a proportional benefit to your business.\n\nThanks.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, clearly, the dollar has strengthened meaningfully and quickly. You got it right, which is, all else equal, with a stronger dollar, you have stronger purchasing power for Americans outside of America. In kind of historical periods where we've had a stronger dollar, we have ultimately seen that lead to some travel patterns outbound from the U.S.\n\nThe opposite of that is, obviously, it's more expensive for people to travel to the U.S. In kind of, again, historical periods of relatively stronger dollars, we've seen some shift in travel patterns of people who might otherwise have traveled to the U.S. going to other places around the world. Having said that, it's still early.\n\nThis particular situation, we're going to have to monitor. And even though in past times, you have seen some changes in travel corridors as a result of a strengthening dollar, we typically have seen the travel spending overall remain consistent. People just plan their holidays in different places around the world, but that takes time. We're a pretty short period into this stronger dollar period so far.\n\nSo, assuming we stay at this point, we'll be able to give you more insight next quarter and future quarters.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Andrew Schmidt with Citi Global Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Schmidt -- Analyst\n\nHey, Ryan, hey, Chris, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the regulatory environment in the U.S. Obviously, a new regulatory regime here. Wondering just your view on that and just conversations maybe you've had with issuers or other parties.\n\nJust trying to get a better sense, I know there's a few things going on in the U.S., obviously. Curious how you're feeling. Thanks so much.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. We're optimistic. Our clients are optimistic. I think what we've heard so far is that the administration wants to move quickly to reduce and simplify regulations, and they're doing it kind of with a goal of spurring economic growth, efficiency, innovation, all very good things.\n\nSo, we're optimistic that these changes are going to reduce the regulatory burden for businesses in general in America, which is good for America and ultimately should be good for Visa. We're optimistic as our clients are that they're going to reduce the regulatory burden, specifically in the financial sector, which will in turn help our FI clients accelerate digital payments and in general, run their businesses more efficiently and more effectively, which is very good for them, which is, in turn, good for us. So, we're optimistic. But again, it's early, and we just have to see what gets implemented, where it gets implemented, and how quickly it does.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Maurer -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to some of the big deal renewals you discussed early in the call and ask about the interplay of the different revenue lines in these renewals.\n\nWhat I'm trying to understand is you're obviously making pricing concessions when you enter into these large renewals or deal expansions. To what degree are you able to make up for that with other revenue or VAS being sold into these issuers? And I know this is complicated, but how much is that accounting for the expansion we're seeing in some of the other revenue? Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. First, just reflecting on this quarter, the last quarter, as you've seen, we've just been having great tremendous success with clients all over the world. And they continue to choose Visa because of our brand, because of our products, because of our innovation, because of our people, but increasingly because of our value-added services and because of our CMS or new flows capabilities. And I guess I would answer your question this way.\n\nWhen we engage and our teams engage with partners on these types of renewal, extension, new business deals that you're talking about, it is vastly different than it was three or four years ago. The types of conversations that we're having with our clients are much more multifaceted. They're very rich conversations about a broad array of services that we can provide them, one of which is, of course, network services for their debit cards and credit cards. But in a much more significant way, we're having conversations about processing, about services, about fraud and risk services, about ways that as part of a multifaceted agreement, we can expand from historical relationships in consumer payments to small business cards, commercial cards, specific priorities around fleet, for example, or around agricultural verticals or different types of B2B verticals.\n\nIt's a very different sales motion. It's a very different type of negotiation. But importantly, as you alluded to, it involves a lot of different revenue levers than we historically would have had. So, it varies from client to client and market to market and what's important to them.\n\nBut our teams are increasingly having success building on deep relationships historically in consumer payments and taking the opportunity of these renewals to really expand our partnerships, especially into new flows opportunities, into VAS opportunities, deepening our relationship with those partners and creating new revenue growth opportunities.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Jeff Cantwell with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Cantwell -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you. Does the news this week on DeepSeek influence how you're thinking about your business strategy, possibly in terms of whether you're thinking about stepping up the usage of AI to help with managing internal costs or maybe in terms of whether you're thinking about using AI as a tool to support your growth and unlock new revenue opportunities. Because it does appear from an outsider's perspective, AI potentially could help improve operating efficiency.\n\nIt might even perhaps support some of your revenue areas like authorization or fraud prevention. So, I wanted to ask you for your view on what DeepSeek and the rise of AI generally means for Visa as far as strategy and where you see opportunity going forward. Thanks.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, we agree with you. Everything that's happening in the world, whether it's DeepSeek or the many, many things that have happened before and will happen after it, all are examples of opportunities for us broadly across Visa. We were very early adopters of artificial intelligence, and we continue to drive hard at the adoption of generative AI as we have for the last couple of years. So, we've been working to embed AI and AI tooling into our company's operations, I guess, broadly.\n\nWe've seen material gains in productivity, particularly in our engineering teams. We've deployed AI tooling in client services, sales, finance, marketing, really everywhere across the company. And we were a very early adopter of applied AI in the analytics and modeling space, very early by like decades, we've been using AI in that space. So, our data science and risk management teams have, at this point, decades of applied experience with AI, and they're aggressively adopting the current generations of AI technology to enhance both our internal and our market-facing predictive and detective modeling capabilities.\n\nOur product teams are also aggressively adopting gen AI to build and ship new products. I think I talked last quarter about data tokens. That's a great example. And just as the Internet itself fundamentally changed the way that we all shop and buy and the way commerce works itself, we deeply believe that AI is going to be a driving force that is going to change the way digital commerce works.\n\nAnd we have an amazing team of people that are working really hard to ensure that Visa plays a central and sustainable role in the next version of digital commerce. And I think we'll have more to say about that in future quarters.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nLast question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nHey, thanks. I'll close it out with a question and a clarification if you don't mind. Just on the question with Asia Pac, it looks like that's the only laggard again as a region. Otherwise, growth is really good.\n\nAny change in outlook for Asia Pac? And the usual macro versus structural question there, just curious if there's any change in thinking in the region. My clarification was just on the restructuring. Was that contemplated in your prior guide? I presume that the savings that you get from that will be reinvested pretty quickly. Sorry if I missed that.\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nGreat. OK. Let me quickly get to it. Maybe the latter one first, just to clear it.\n\nRestructuring, we recorded a charge this quarter. It's reflected in the guide for the full year. It's really focusing on expenses. We don't expect another charge this year.\n\nAnd sorry, remind me your first question again.\n\nRyan McInerney -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAsia Pac.\n\nChris Suh -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAsia Pacific. Yes, sorry. So, AP growth, I think you characterized it right. It is moderately up from Q4, about one point, a little bit more than one point, but it still reflects a somewhat muted environment.\n\nSo, it's growing at 1% in total, moving in the right direction but still quite muted.\n\nJennifer Como -- Senior Vice President, Head of Global Investor Relations\n\nAnd with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team.

            "content": "Visa\u2019s fiscal first-quarter results noted significant growth in payments done digitally, and in tokens and credentials issued by the payments network.\n\nPayments volume grew by 9% in the latest quarter, as the U.S. was up 7%, and cross-border volume was up by 11%. Within the U.S., debit volumes were up 8% and credit volumes were 7% higher. Cross-border volumes were 15% higher in constant dollar terms.\n\nCEO Ryan McInerney said on the conference call with analysts that the quarterly volume of about $4 trillion is being driven by the shift to digital payments, which now account for more than 60% of volume.\n\nTokens and Credentials Growth\n\nThe company has issued 4.7 billion credentials, which represented 7% growth YOY, and has also issued 12.6 billion tokens, representing a 44% surge YOY.\n\n\u201cIf you just look at eCommerce on tokenized transactions,\u201d McInerney said during the call, \u201cwe have six percentage point higher approval rates. That [translates into] significantly higher sales for our merchant partners and 30% reduction in fraud rates, which is good for everybody in the ecosystem \u2026 Tokens have become one of our most important platforms for enabling innovation.\u201d\n\nMcInerney added: \u201cInterest in our Visa flexible credential continues to grow.\u201d The \u201ctap to add\u201d card, he told analysts, is now live for about 60% of U.S. consumer credit and debit cards.\n\nWith a nod to the appeal of tap-to-pay functions, the CEO noted that 74% of all face-to-face transactions logged by Visa are contactless, with double-digit growth in markets such as Japan and Argentina. In the U.S., tap-to-pay was up 13 percentage points to 57%.\n\nTurning to new flows, McInerney said that revenues in that business line were up 19% in constant dollars. Visa Direct has crossed the 10 billion transaction level on a trailing 12 month basis, with three billion transactions in the latest quarter, and where volumes were up 34%. He noted the announcement this week of the launch of the X Money account as an example of the momentum behind Visa Direct.\n\nThe joint efforts will \u201callow the 600 million or so active monthly users of X to fund their X Money account,\u201d McInerney said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be able to transfer funds back to their bank account instantly \u2026 There will be creators on the X platform that can now get paid much faster when they use Visa Direct to move money back into their to their bank accounts.\u201d\n\nCFO Chris Suh said that, as volumes and revenues grew, \u201cin the U.S., consumer holiday spending growth was in the upper-mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. The consumer categories with the strongest growth were discretionary categories such as retail, travel and entertainment.\u201d eCommerce, as measured as card-not-present volume, was up 16% YOY. Commercial payments volume rose 6% YOY, he said.\n\nLooking ahead, Suh said net revenue growth is expected to be in the high-single digits to low-double digits in the current quarter.\n\nAs value-added services revenue accelerated in the quarter, McInerney said: \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about the progress that we\u2019re making in value-added services across the board. There\u2019s no change in emphasis as it relates to the priority or the prioritization of the areas where we\u2019ve been building and building products and serving clients. So we continue to be very focused on delivering solutions to merchants and acquirers, very focused on delivering solutions to issuers, very focused on delivering fraud and risk solutions, broadly across the ecosystem as well as the advisory business.\u201d\n\nPismo, in particular, and FeatureSpace, he said, are notable acquisitions that are helping to build sales pipelines.\n\nElsewhere, McInerney said that the company remains on track to launch its Visa A2A offering in early 2025, with the initial use cases tied to bill payments.\n\n\u201cThe power \u2026 of taking some of these Visa capabilities into the account-to-account space is going be a great benefit for our clients and our partners in the ecosystem,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nFormer Visa CFO Visa Vasant Prabhu has joined the advisory board of directors for blockchain and cryptocurrency security platform Fireblocks, the company announced Wednesday in a press release.\n\nThe credit card network\u2019s alum is taking the board seat as interest in the wider cryptocurrency space sharpens, with President Donald Trump undertaking multiple actions to create a friendlier relationship with the industry in the early days of his second term. The move also comes as Fireblocks, which offers a secure platform for digital asset transactions, looks to bridge the gap between the blockchain and traditional finance realms \u2014 a goal where Prabhu\u2019s past experience will play a key role, the company said.\n\n\u201cWith his unmatched experience in scaling global payments networks and leading public companies, Vasant brings a unique perspective that aligns perfectly with Fireblocks\u2019 vision,\u201d the company\u2019s CFO, Michael Levine, said in a statement emailed to CFO Dive. \u201cVisa is the gold standard for networks, and as we build out the Fireblocks Network, Vasant\u2019s expertise will be invaluable in shaping our next phase of growth.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPrabhu \u2014 who previously served as Visa\u2019s CFO and vice chair for eight years, departing in 2023 \u2014 currently sits on the board for companies including software and tax service provider Intuit, Delta Airlines, consumer health firm Kenvue and the Brookings Institution. His past CFO roles also include a stint as finance chief for NBCUniversal, Safeway and Starwood Hotels, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"The payments landscape is at a critical inflection point, and blockchain technology is the engine driving this transformation,\" Prabhu said in a statement included in the Wednesday release. Fireblocks is targeting continued expansion as payments volume rises. Institutional transactions spiked by 85% year-over-year in 2024, according to the release.\n\nWith Prabhu, the digital asset platform is gaining a veteran of a major credit card network player in the traditional financial markets at a time when cryptocurrency firms are looking to establish higher trust and credibility.\n\nIt also comes amid a swell of first-week actions by President Donald Trump, some focused on the cryptocurrency market. The president has pledged to take a friendlier approach to the industry, which has struggled to establish itself as a legitimate alternative to traditional finance among challenges related to its volatility and security as well as concerns related to its use for fraud or money laundering.\n\nAmong other moves, Trump tapped cryptocurrency advocates for key roles including leadership of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 nominating crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins to serve as the SEC Chair, following the departure of Gary Gensler, CFO Dive previously reported. As Atkins awaits Senate confirmation, Trump on Tuesday also appointed crypto-friendly Commissioner Mark Uyeda to serve as acting chair.\n\nIn a separate Tuesday release, the SEC announced the creation of a \u201ccrypto task force\u201d to be led by fellow Commissioner Hester Peirce \u2014 who, alongside Uyeda, often dissented on the agency\u2019s crypto-related decisions under Gensler\u2019s leadership, CFO Dive previously reported. Gensler, who was often criticized by Republicans for his aggressive enforcement actions related to crypto, officially departed from his role on Jan. 20.\n\nHowever, some of Trump\u2019s actions surrounding crypto have already created pushback among critics, who worry certain decisions by the president could harm, rather than help, the industry\u2019s much-needed credibility. In a move that has sparked both praise and critique, for example, Trump fulfilled a campaign pledge by issuing a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of dark web marketplace Silk Road, also on Tuesday.\n\nOn Silk Road, cryptocurrency was used for the illegal sale of drugs, and Ulbricht was convicted on seven charges including distributing narcotics, in federal court and has been serving a life sentence since 2015, according to a report by CNBC.\n\n\u201cI just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\u201d Trump wrote in a Tuesday post on Truth Social. \u201cThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me.\u201d",

Foreign students were also a specific target for Republican lawmakers after the campus protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza last summer.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has already asked immigration officials to tighten visa vetting procedures, which will likely slow processing times in embassies and consulates. Immigration advocates had expected this increased bureaucratic red tape, which was also a hallmark of Trump\u2019s first term. However, data from his first administration paints a less grim picture for foreign students than Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric might suggest. During those years, the flow of international students stayed elevated. This time around, experts expect a similar pattern: while cracking down on some kinds of immigration, others, like students, will proceed largely unchanged.",

Bier, the associate director for immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research organization. \u201cThere\u2019s no one paying attention to this at all.\u201d\n\nWait times for interviews for business and tourist visas, which built up under the Biden administration, top 330 days at 18 U.S. embassies and consulates, with some of the longest waits coming in India, Colombia, Peru and Honduras. And since World Cup tickets aren\u2019t expected to go on sale until late this year, most fans planning to come to the U.S. for the games will have less than six months to secure the necessary paperwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned that there does not seem to be an appetite for making sure that the State Department is funded and prepared and focused on this issue,\u201d said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Los Angeles), who last fall led a bipartisan group of 53 lawmakers in urging Antony J. Blinken, President Biden\u2019s secretary of State, to lean into sports diplomacy as the U.S. prepares to host seven major global sporting events, including the World Cup and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, during the next decade.\n\n\u201cIt is untenable that we would not surge resources to make sure that we have the right folks in the right places,\u201d Kamlager-Dove said. \u201cThey need to facilitate these interviews and get these visas to those who are trying to enter our country for legitimate reasons. It will be unacceptable that we allow our country to fail at putting our best foot forward for the World Cup.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the State Department said in a statement the agency is \u201ccommitted to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake. U.S. prestige would take a humiliating blow if red tape and bureaucratic bungling closed the borders to World Cup visitors. There would also be an economic cost. SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which borders Kamlager-Dove\u2019s district, will host eight World Cup games. That is expected to bring 180,000 visitors and an economic impact of nearly $600 million to greater Los Angeles, according to a report by Micronomics Economic Research and Consulting.\n\nThe tournament, the largest in World Cup history with an expanded field of 48 teams and 104 matches, will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico and is expected to draw nearly twice as many visitors from June 11-July 19, 2026, as the last World Cup in Qatar in 2022. And 78 of those matches will be played in 11 U.S. cities, meaning this country could enjoy more than $3.75 billion of the economic boost the entire tournament is expected to generate.\n\n\u201cThis is really an unprecedented opportunity that we have as a country over the next 10 years,\u201d said Travis Murphy, a former U.S. diplomat who is the founder and chief executive of Jetr Global Partners, a Washington-based firm that works to solve visa and immigrant issues for athletes and sports franchises. \u201cIf we want those people, then we are going to have to make changes. How we manage the next few years \u2014 and immigration is a fundamental component of that \u2014 is really going to be key to whether or not we\u2019re successful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his first term, President Trump promised FIFA that World Cup organizations and their fans would not face restrictions coming to the U.S. for the tournament. (Mark Schiefelbein / Associated Press)\n\nThe Trump administration and its supporters could have a lot to say about that. During his first term, when the U.S. and its two neighbors were bidding to host the 2026 World Cup, President Trump signed a trio of letters in which he promised FIFA that World Cup organizations and their fans would not face restrictions coming to the U.S. for the tournament.\n\nIn one letter Trump wrote that \u201call eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.\u201d\n\nFIFA officials say concerns over visa wait times \u2014 which also threatens to impact the FIFA Club World Cup, to be played in 11 U.S. cities this summer \u2014 are overblown and point to those letters and to Trump\u2019s personal relationship with Infantino as proof that the president is committed to the World Cup, an event FIFA considers too big to fail.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that the incoming administration [was] in office during the successful bid process for 2026, and signed the government guarantees as part of that process,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to work with various departments and agencies of the U.S. government to ensure the U.S. can capitalize on this once-in-a-generation opportunity to tap into billions of dollars in positive financial benefits and goodwill, and bring millions of people from different nations and communities together to celebrate in the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump referenced the World Cup during a pre-inauguration rally in Washington D.C. last week and in remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Despite that, some FIFA officials remain quietly concerned, people with knowledge about the situation not authorized to discuss it publicly told The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its statement to The Times, the organization said it will \u201ccontinue to push visa information to fans and other relevant stakeholders through various FIFA channels\u201d and is working in ensure fans can apply for visas without having to purchase a ticket first, a delay that would have made it nearly impossible for people in dozens of countries to attend the tournament.\n\nWhile Trump has spoken favorably of the World Cup, he has also made a crackdown on immigration, legal and otherwise, a centerpiece of his administration\u2019s agenda, tightening restrictions and reducing staff, which could introduce new friction for both business travelers and tourists seeking visas.\n\nOn Sunday, for example, as part of a standoff with Colombian president Gustavo Petro, Trump suspended the processing of visas and canceling appointments at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, where the wait was already 700 days. That\u2019s significant because only the U.S. and Brazil, among foreign countries, bought more tickets to the 2018 World Cup than Colombia, the last in which the country qualified to play.\n\nRep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA) is among those raising the alarm on the visa approval delay issues that could cut off many fans from attending the World Cup and Los Angeles Olympics. (Nathan Posner / Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThe State Department, now run by former Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, manages visa processing and has pledged to lower wait times but it has also said it will not treat soccer fans preferentially. That contrasts with Russia and Qatar, the last two World Cup hosts, who streamlined the process for ticket-holders to enter their countries.\n\nThe Laken Riley Act, named for a Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant who was convicted of murder, could jumble things further. Among other things the bill, approved by Congress and sent to the president\u2019s desk last week, gives individual states the power to demand the government withhold visas from citizens of countries that refuse to accept the return of deported nationals. That would allow, for example, Iowa or Mississippi, states which are hosting no World Cup activities and thus have no financial stake in the games, to sue to block the issuance of visas to people from more than a dozen countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated for sure,\u201d said Bier, who testified before Congress on immigration issues last week. \u201cThey could be pressured into blocking all visas. It could be a very huge problem if it is fully implemented.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s harsh rhetoric may pose additional hurdles. Although much of the president\u2019s ire has been aimed at immigrants without legal status, many of his supporters have conflated that into opposition for all forms of immigration, including the admission of highly skilled foreign workers and even tourists. That could make it hard for the State Department to start approving hundreds of thousands of visas for World Cup visitors, even if they qualify.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, visas for temporary nonimmigrant visas \u2014 the kind typically issued to tourists \u2014 fell 10% between 2017-19, then plunged 54% in Trump\u2019s final year, according to the Migration Policy Institute, although the COVID-19 pandemic also had an impact on that decline.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration didn\u2019t prioritize visa processing,\u201d Bier said. \u201cIt really slowed down visa processing, removing requirements to process visas quickly. So I can\u2019t imagine that there\u2019s going to be some full-court press to get these visas processed in a short amount of time.\u201d\n\nAttempting to get a U.S. visa can be a complicated, cumbersome and lengthy ordeal. Applicants must begin by filling out Form DS-160, which the State Department says typically takes 90 minutes to complete. Applicants must also submit extensive documentation about their personal lives, education, employment history and the places they intend to visit in the U.S. \u2014 all in English \u2014 and pay a $185 nonrefundable fee at the time of their in-person interview at an embassy or consulate.\n\nThose rules do not apply to people in the 42 countries covered by the Visa Waiver Program, a cooperative agreement between the U.S. and partner nations such as Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, France and Australia, which enables citizens of those countries to travel to the U.S. for up to 90 days for tourism or business without a visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, 1.8 million people, nearly a quarter of those who applied for visitor visas, were denied. In that same year, according to the Department of Homeland Security, 1.31% of foreign visitors to the U.S. overstayed their visas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that we compromise our national security,\u201d said Kamlager-Dove, a member of the House Foreign Affairs committee. But, she added \u201cthere are some real things that they can be doing and hopefully they find the courage to do it. It\u2019s not that hard. They need more people to take care of these applications and to do these interviews.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Tracy Wilkinson contributed to this story.",

This order may reinstate and expand upon directives Trump issued during his first term, restricting travel to the United States by certain foreign nationals (sometimes referred to as a \u201ctravel ban\u201d). Notably, in 2018, the US Supreme Court held, by a 5-4 majority, that the President has the authority to exclude foreign nationals when he determines that the entry would be detrimental to the United States.\n\nThe executive order seeks to identify ongoing deficiencies in the information needed to assess whether nationals of particular countries present a security threat, based upon a risk assessment \u201cbaseline.\u201d If foreign governments fail to share sufficient information, or if there are other risk factors present, the Administration may impose restrictions for those seeking to enter the United States \u2013 and pursue the removal of those already in the country.\n\nDuring the Presidential campaign and transition, President Trump stated plans to \u201crestore the travel ban.\u201d While this order does not impose a travel ban, it does signal that one might be issued within 60 days or soon thereafter from the signing of the order.\n\nHighlights from the Executive Order\n\nThe order is aimed at protecting Americans \u201cfrom aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten [US] national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\u201d To this end, the order calls for enhanced vetting of foreign nationals, and directs agencies to evaluate and adjust existing procedures to ensure the continued safety of the United States and its citizens.\n\n\n\nMore specifically:\n\nThe Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence, is directed to \u201cvet and screen to the maximum degree possible\u201d foreign nationals seeking admission into, or already present in, the United States.\n\nWithin 30 days of the order, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence, is directed to: Evaluate and adjust existing regulations, policies, procedures, and provisions of the Foreign Service Manual, or guidance of any kind, pertaining to each of the grounds of inadmissibility. Ensure that safeguards are in place to prevent refugees or stateless persons from entering the United States without stringent identification verification beyond that required of other foreign nationals seeking entry into the country. Evaluate visa programs to ensure they are not used to harm the security or other national interests of the United States. Evaluate the sufficiency of programs designed to ensure the \u201cassimilation of lawful immigrants into the United States, and recommend any additional measures to be taken that promote a unified American identity and attachment to the Constitution, laws, and founding principles of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe order also directs the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence to jointly submit a report, within 60 days, identifying countries \u201cfor which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries\u201d and identify how many nationals from those countries have entered the United States since January 20, 2021 (under President Joseph Biden\u2019s term).\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is ordered to take immediate steps to remove foreign nationals identified as a risk, unless doing so would disrupt a criminal investigation, prosecution, or national security interests.\n\nWhat This Means for Employers\n\nThe Administration is expected to issue a partial or full \u201ctravel ban,\u201d restricting entry to the United States by citizens from certain designated high-risk countries.\n\n\n\nIn his prior Administration, President Trump issued a travel ban that included restrictions on entry to the United States for citizens of Chad, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. At the time of this writing, the Administration has not published the list of countries that might be covered under a new travel ban.\n\n\n\nAny new travel ban will impact employees and new hires who are overseas, as well as US-based employees who may not be permitted to return to the United States after a departure. Employers are advised to review internal travel policies and create a plan for assessing risk associated with international business trips for impacted employees.\n\nEmployees who make visa applications at a US Embassy or Consulate abroad may face delays in visa issuance, due to enhancing screening procedures and administrative processing. New or different requirements may be imposed on visa applicants, which would be expected to extend processing times and adjudications periods.\n\nVisa appointment availability at the US Embassies and Consulates abroad may decline. This would lead to (even longer) wait times for employees required to renew visas before returning to the United States, likely disrupting travel plans and associated business and staffing plans.\n\nA new order may also impact foreign nationals in the United States who may be subject to removal, particularly those applying for an immigration benefit such as an extension of stay or change of status.\n\nHow Mayer Brown Can Help\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s first week in office provided a clear roadmap of his policy priorities, and marked the beginning of a significant overhaul of immigration policies. Mayer Brown is poised to assist employers with devising an international travel strategy for their employees and business travellers, and developing mobility solutions that mitigate risk and business disruption.",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant permit, granting highly skilled workers entry to the US on a temporary basis to live and work for three years, after which they can extend their stay for another three years if they wish to remain. To obtain an H-1B visa, applicants must be sponsored by an employer, who will submit a registration petitioning the USCIS on their behalf. Key employers that sponsor the visa include major tech companies such as Amazon and Meta , as well as innovative startups including Databricks and Stripe .\n\nThe US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) overhauled the H-1B visa application process for the 2025 fiscal year, introducing a new system designed to curb fraudulent practices and reduce overall numbers of registrations. So far, the changes have reduced numbers by 38%.\n\nChanges to the 2025 application process for the popular H-1B visa , which helps foreign business school graduates and other highly skilled workers to live and work in the United States, are already yielding results and indicating an improved process for future applicants, data shows.\n\nUnderstanding recent H1B visa changes\n\nB visa registrations following the process overhaul suggests less competition moving forward, and a more equitable process for those looking to apply for the coveted visa which is oversubscribed by hundreds of thousands of registrations each year.\n\nThe changes to the H-1B visa process, which came into effect from March 4th 2024 ahead of the 2025 fiscal year, involved a shift towards a \u2018beneficiary-centric process\u2019. The change meant moving forward H-1B visa registrations would be \u201cselected by unique beneficiary rather than registration,\u201d the USCIS announced.\n\nPrevious rules allowed employers to submit multiple H-1B visa registrations for individual beneficiaries to increase their chances of approval. Under the new system, one registration is permitted for each beneficiary, ensuring all potential H-1B visa holders have an even chance of selection.\n\nThe USCIS also introduced a number of changes to further the integrity of the H-1B visa process and prevent duplicate registrations. This included a requirement for potential H-1B visa holders to provide valid passport information or valid travel document information, with beneficiaries only allowed to be registered under one travel or passport document. Fraudulent attempts would also face disqualification and possible legal action, the USCIS announced.\n\nImpact of H1B visa changes\n\nPrior to the H-1B visa overhaul, registration numbers had been increasing dramatically year-on-year. Eligible registrations rose from 269,424 in 2021 to 474,421 in 2023, two years later. By the 2024 fiscal year, this figure had risen significantly again to 758,994.\n\nCurrently there is a congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 visa issuances applied to the H-1B visa, with a further 20,000 on top of this allocated for those with advanced degrees, including MBAs and master\u2019s qualifications.\n\nSince the changes have been implemented, eligible registrations for the fiscal year 2025 fell by around 38% to 470,342. The number of unique beneficiaries remained largely unchanged, with the USCIS estimating there were 442,000 in 2025 versus 446,000 the previous year.\n\nThe USCIS also confirmed there was an average of 1.06 registrations per beneficiary in the 2025 fiscal year, compared to 1.70 in 2024. The number of employers petitioning for H-1B visas remained largely unchanged.\n\nWith the figures suggesting the overhaul has successfully contributed toward the USCIS\u2019s goal of reducing fraud and making the H-1B visa registration process more equitable, foreign nationals hoping to use the visa to gain employment opportunities in the US can expect a more level playing field moving forward.\n\nH1B Visa Year-On-Year Eligible Registration Figures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of the H1B visa under the Trump administration\n\nThe H-1B visa process overhaul was first introduced in the US in 2024 under the previous government administration led by President Joe Biden. Since the reelection of Donald Trump in November 2024, the H-1B visa has resurfaced as a key point of debate, in part due to President Trump having temporarily suspended the visa during his previous term in office.\n\nDuring the period between his election victory and inauguration on January 20th 2025, Trump was quoted in a New York Post article appearing to back the H-1B visa program. \u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has since stated that he welcomes competent people entering the country, adding: \u201cI'm not just talking about engineers, I'm talking about people at all levels.\u201d\n\nThough Trump has offered little concrete information about future H-1B visa plans, other signs of a potential shift in stance on the program include appointing Sriram Krishnan as his senior policy adviser on AI\u2014an entrepreneur who has talked in the past about making it easier for skilled foreign workers to come to the United States. Elon Musk, the SpaceX and Tesla founder who Trump recently appointed as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has also spoken in support of the visa scheme.\n\n\u201cWhile President Trump did not support the H1B visa program during his first term, it is encouraging to see that he now appears open to it. Nevertheless, the specifics remain uncertain,\u201d said Tahmina Watson, immigration attorney and founder of Watson Immigration Law.\n\n\u201cOne concern is whether we might see new executive orders akin to the previous \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d directive, which led to increased scrutiny and a higher rate of visa denials.\n\n\u201cDespite these concerns, the national debate underscores the fact that foreign workers are vital to the United States economy. Both political sides, as well as President Trump, acknowledge that H-1B visas play a key role for American businesses,\u201d she added.",

A travel agency official in Manila said the embassy has indicated it is cutting the daily cap on visa applications by about 50 percent.\n\nThe change has overwhelmed agency branches, with long lines forming before opening hours and all slots often filled by morning. Some agencies have suspended applications or switched to an appointment-only system.\n\nThe embassy is set to transition to a \"visa center system\" later this year, outsourcing processing to a designated agency. While the change is expected to improve efficiency, industry stakeholders worry about the impact of consolidating services under one firm.\n\nAccording to the Japan National Tourism Organization, an estimated 818,700 Filipino travelers visited Japan in 2024, a 31.6 percent increase from the previous year and a record high for the second consecutive year.\n\nAmong the six core countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei -- the Philippines ranked second after Thailand in visitor numbers to Japan in 2024 but represented the highest growth rate. The weak yen, along with an increase in direct flights by budget airlines, have contributed to the rise.\n\nHowever, with Japan's tourist visa screening for Filipinos remaining stringent, including income verification and other document requirements, additional restrictions and processing delays may push travelers to seek alternative destinations.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nJapan government eyes extending stays of pregnant skilled foreign workers\n\nForeign entries to Japan hit record high 36 mil. in 2024 on weak yen\n\nJapan to ease visa requirements, agrees on top China diplomat visit",

This approach could also be deployed to pressure countries that resist other U.S. demands unrelated to immigration. While the dispute with Colombia was resolved, the fallout lingers, and normal visa operations in Bogota have not resumed as of today (Tuesday, January 28, 2025). When they are restored, delays in obtaining appointments will continue and likely worsen.\n\nPresidential authority under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to order the suspension of visa services to individuals and groups, including specific nationalities, is broad and has been upheld by the courts. Should the administration decide to shut down or severely limit visa services to other countries or groups of individuals in the future, there will likely be little notice, and the potential disruption to normal travel for citizens of those countries will be significant. Possession of valid visas will not insulate these individuals, as the President also has the authority to instruct the Department of State to cancel previously issued visas and to instruct immigration officers at the border to deny entry to them.\n\nAlthough the cancellation of a valid visa does not automatically serve to terminate the lawfully admitted status of persons already in the United States, it would mean that if those persons had to depart the U.S. for any reason they would not be able to return in valid status until such time as the administration determined to rescind the ban against issuing new visas to them.\n\nThis new era of uncertainty poses serious challenges for employers and their employees holding valid employment-authorizing nonimmigrant visas, even those from countries closely allied to the United States. With visa operations now subject to sudden interruption, personal and professional travel outside the United States could become problematic.

The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users\u2019 debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.\n\nAccording to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant\u2019s instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.\n\nWhether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.\n\nIn her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\u201d has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.\n\nAnd his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.\n\nThe landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.\n\nConsumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X\u2019s coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk\u2019s 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.\n\nX\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.\n\nAs part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.\n\n____\n\nAP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed to this report from San Francisco.",

As part of that campaign, X has been collecting money transmitter licenses, state by state, to build X\u2019s own nationwide network.\n\nIn a separate post Tuesday on X, Visa acknowledged the new alliance. \u201cVisa Direct will make it possible for US X Money Account users to fund and transfer money in real-time with their debit card,\u201d the post from Visa said in response to Yaccarino\u2019s post. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Visa referred to the company\u2019s post.\n\nMusk appointed Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal executive, to lead Twitter in May 2023. Around the same time, X began accumulating state money transfer licenses under the name Twitter Payments, beginning with Arizona, Michigan, Missouri and New Hampshire. The platform now about 40 state licenses, according to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS).\n\nMusk has experience in the payments industry as a co-founder of the online bank X.com in 1999 before it merged with another business to become PayPal.\n\nMusk efforts to create the X wallet\n\nHe was making plans for the X payments feature even before the Twitter deal closed. In 2022, he said he could create a payments business that would contribute $1.3 billion to the company within six years, according to an October 2022 report from The New York Times. The owner of SpaceX and the largest shareholder of electric car-maker Tesla also told Twitter\u2019s staff that he had plans to \u201cpopulate a balance for every verified Twitter user,\u201d according to a November 2022 report from media outlet The Verge.\n\n\u201cGive them some amount of money, like ten bucks or something, that they can send anywhere in the system,\u201d he said, according to a transcript posted by the Verge. \u201cWe need money transfer licenses for that, which we\u2019ve applied for.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s businesses stand to benefit from his connections to the White House. He became a significant donor to Trump, delivering as much as a quarter of a billion dollars to the then candidate\u2019s campaign and related political action committees last year.\n\nNow, Musk is heading up an advisory group that will make recommendations to the Trump administration for federal government cost cuts and government efficiency moves.\n\nWhy it\u2019s good for Visa\n\nMeanwhile, Visa has been aiming to offer more services, beyond its card services sweet spot, and specifically to strengthen its Visa Direct offering for moving money through bank accounts. In a press release last month, it touted its ability to use that rail to let users transfer funds in less than a minute by way of a debit card.\n\nVisa Direct has also been the means by which the card network is seeking to become a bigger player in the international remittances arena, letting people send money to family and friends in other countries.\n\nIt may be handy for Visa to have a new connection to the White House. It has been trying to fend off increased scrutiny from the federal government as well as some congressional members over the past several years.\n\nLast September, the Justice Department sued Visa in a civil antitrust lawsuit over its debit card practices in federal court. The department alleged the card network\u2019s anticompetitive activities in the debit card market stifled competition from companies pitching newer digital payment tools. Prosecutors argued that those Visa debit card moves also injured U.S. consumers and merchants because it was able to charge exorbitant fees.\n\nThe company has also faced harsh criticism on Capitol Hill where Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Roger Marshall teamed up in 2022 to sponsor the Credit Card Competition Act proposal, seeking to foster more competition for Visa and its no. 2 rival, Mastercard. During a hearing on that issue last month, even Republicans castigated a Visa executive over the company\u2019s escalating interchange fees imposed on merchants. As a senator, now Republican Vice President J.D. Vance was also a sponsor of the legislation.\n\nThe competitive digital wallet arena\n\nA lot of digital wallet companies have beat X to the field. PayPal and its Venmo peer-to-peer payments unit have been burnishing digital wallet applications for years, attracting both merchant and consumer users. PayPal now has hundreds of millions of consumer accounts and tens of millions of merchant accounts.\n\nIn addition, tech titans Google and Apple have been spooling up their payments plays, expanding to add features that make them more useful to consumers.\n\nBlock\u2019s Cash App has also become a major player, with merchants using the Square service and consumers now able to tap the company\u2019s Afterpay buy now, pay later options.\n\nStill, X is formidable. As of last year, it had about 336 million users worldwide, down from 368 million over the past three years, according to Statistica. And Visa is X\u2019s first digital wallet partner, Yaccarino said.\n\nIt\u2019s a strong one, given Visa is the largest U.S. card network and the second-biggest in the world. That makes an attention-getting difference, said Peter Tapling, a Chicago-based industry consultant who formerly worked for Early Warning Services, the company behind Zelle. The move \u201cadds some credibility\u201d to X\u2019s wallet efforts, he said by email.\n\nFor Visa, it\u2019s one more way in which the company can insert its hand into the payments flow for some sort of a payout. \u201cVisa wants to be in the middle of any payment anywhere,\u201d Tapling said.\n\nMonetizing the X payments play\n\nVisa may ultimately serve as more than just a network for X as the social media company seeks to monetize the new wallet. It remains a question as to how X will earn income, whether from merchant or consumer fees. The network could provide the functionality that merchants expect for processing transactions.\n\nMusk \u201cmight be thinking further down the road,\u201d said Jed Rice, a former PayPal executive. \u201cThe challenge for every peer-to-peer network is to figure out how to monetize\u201d the service, he said.\n\nTo make money, there has to be a framework for refunds, chargebacks, fraud monitoring and other features, Rice explained. \u201cAnytime you start moving from a peer-to-peer network to a commercial payment network where you\u2019re going to charge fees, merchants who pay those fees will expect a certain level of functionality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot here that can go wrong and that might be why he\u2019s thinking \u2018I need to ride Visa\u2019s rails,\u2019\u201d Rice said.",

And if we needed another reason to break free from the chains of our desks, New Zealand has just loosened its visa restrictions for remote workers.\n\nStarting on January 27, 2025, the New Zealand Visitor Visa will allow employees who work remotely for a foreign company to live and work in New Zealand for up to 90 days. Self-employed remote workers with clients outside New Zealand can also apply. Unlike other digital nomad visas, there appears to be no minimum income requirement.\n\n\u201cThe change will enable many visitors to extend their stays which will lead to more money being spent in the country,\u201d New Zealand\u2019s Immigration Minister Erica Stanford said in a statement accompanying Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cDelivering economic growth is critical to improving our quality of life, strengthening local businesses, lifting incomes, and creating opportunities for Kiwis.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand is the latest country to use relaxed travel restrictions as a way of courting digital nomads, whose long-term stays and spending habits can provide a sustainable and lucrative tourism stream. At least 66 countries currently offer some form of a digital nomad visa, with South Korea, Italy, Japan, and Kenya launching programs within the past year.\n\nDigital Nomads: Are They Crowding Destinations or Reviving Them?

The Visitor Visa currently permits students to study in New Zealand for up to 90 days. It also allows tourists to stay in New Zealand for up to six months (multiple entry) or nine months (single entry)\u2014out of which 90 days can be spent engaged in remote work, per the new rule.\n\nThe new digital nomad option is only available to foreign workers with remote work based outside of New Zealand. Visitors coming to work for New Zealand employers must obtain a separate Work Visa, while those conducting business in New Zealand for foreign companies should apply for a Business Visitor Visa.\n\nDigital nomads can apply for the new Visitor Visa online via New Zealand\u2019s digital immigration portal. The visa fee is NZD $341 (approximately $193) and 80% of applications are processed within 3.5 weeks. Recipients may also be required to pay the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL), a $100 fee that funds various infrastructure and conservation projects.",

Nearly one-fourth of the active U.S. physician workforce are foreign graduates and international medical graduates (IMG). Nonimmigrant or immigrant visas are needed for IMG physicians to legally practice in the U.S. when they are not U.S. citizens.\n\nIMGs succeed with AMA benefits Resources to help navigate the U.S. health care system\n\nAccess to nationwide observation opportunities Join the AMA Today\n\nBefore applying for a visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate, the following is required:\n\nDOL\u2014The U.S. employer must obtain foreign labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor, prior to filing a petition with USCIS.\n\nUSCIS\u2014U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approval of a petition or application (The required petition or application depends on the visa category you plan to apply for.)\n\nSEVIS\u2014Program approval entered in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System\n\nState department chart State department chart\n\nThe U.S. State Department, Bureau of Consular Affairs offers a chart defining different types of visas. The chart lists the various purposes of temporary travel and related nonimmigrant visa categories available.\n\nNote: This does not represent a complete list of all travel purposes for the visa category. The chart lists almost all non-immigrant visa categories, but not all. More information can be found in the Foreign Affairs Manual, 9 FAM 402.1 for all non-immigrant visa categories.\n\nTypes of visa status Types of visa status\n\nPhysicians can work in the U.S. on four major types of visa status: H-1B, J-1, O-1, and TN. In the 2020 academic year, 4,222 IMG physicians from over 100 countries were offered visas to facilitate residency training in different specialties1. All visas need to be renewed for the duration of residency and fellowship training, and each visa type has a different renewal schedule.\n\nH-1B visa for physicians H-1B visa for physicians\n\nThe H-1B visa is for temporary workers in specialty occupations who hold professional-level degrees. It has no two-year home residence requirement. The H-1B visa allows a foreign national to enter the U.S. for professional level employment for up to six years.\n\nSince the early 90s, Congress has allowed physicians to access an H-1B visa for clinical practice when academic qualification and licensure requirements are met. The academic and practice requirements include the successful completion of all three U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) steps, state medical board licensure requirements, and certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG). This visa also requires the fulfillment of the Department of Labor requirements of prevailing wage and Labor Condition Application (LCA).\n\nThe H-1B visa is available to graduates of foreign medical schools who have passed the necessary examinations, have a license or other authorization required by the state of practice, and have an unrestricted license to practice medicine or have graduated from a foreign or U.S. medical school.\n\nThe proportion of residency programs sponsoring H-1B visas for training has gradually decreased in the last few years as the immigration requirements are multistep, costly (for the employer), and often complicated with bureaucratic immigration nuances. In October 2020, the USCIS released an interim Final Rule informing the Department of Labor to review the prevailing wage for several work categories that would potentially affect the prospect of employment for many IMG physicians.\n\nCertain specialties and employment settings might struggle to successfully meet the wage and specialty occupation criteria to obtain a new H-1B status or to renew an existing H-1B status to allow the IMG physicians to continue their training or practice.\n\nFrequently asked questions about the H-1B visa Frequently asked questions about the H-1B visa\n\nCan an IMG physician transition to independent practice after their training on an H-1B visa?\n\nTo transition to practice on an H-1B visa, the IMG physician would need a not-for-profit organization or a university system to sponsor their H-1B visa, to be counted as 'cap-exempt', so that they would not have to enter the capped number of 85,000 H-1B visas' lottery every year. Every time they change their employment, they would need to have a sponsor of similar ability to get their 'cap-exempt' H-1B visa.\n\nHow to smoothly renew an H-1B visa for training and practice?\n\nDuring training, the program Graduate Medical Education and the immigration office handle the renewal of this visa. However, as the IMG physician transitions into practice, their employer would hire an immigration attorney to work with the physician in most cases. The renewal of this visa is dependent on the Department of Labor's prevailing wage determination, and LCA, the process has several moving pieces and often needs eight to twelve months.\n\nOnce the renewal application is submitted, the physician can work for up to a maximum of 240 days on pending status. After this period, the physician must leave the country and wait for the pending application to be approved. This timeline has been even longer during the pandemic, and many IMG physicians' legal status could be potentially impaired.\n\nHow long does a physician remain on an H-1B visa?\n\nAn IMG physician's H-1B status depends on their country of birth and their status of immigrant visa application. As IMG physicians fill the workforce gap in rural and underserved areas, most employers would sponsor an immigrant (or permanent) visa status for these physicians. This application can be made in several different categories of employment-based immigration. The most common employment-based immigration category for physicians is EB-2, where the employer would have to file a PERM application and an i-140 application.\n\nOnce approved, the physician would have to wait for their \"priority date\" to be current to petition for \"adjustment of status.\" The priority date's progression depends on several factors; the country of birth is the most important one. The USCIS publishes \"The Visa Bulletin\" with updates on the status of priority dates for each country and each immigrant visa category.\n\nAs long as the priority date is not current, the physician would need to renew their H-1B visas. An H-1B visa can be issued for a maximum of six years. An immigrant petition must be filed before the end of the sixth year for the physician to be allowed to renew their H-1B visa beyond that six-year mark.\n\nWhat are the barriers for IMG physicians on a visa during the pandemic?\n\nDuring the pandemic, IMG physicians are facing different barriers in their stability and immigration-related endeavors. The process of immigration was complicated and time-consuming even before the pandemic. With the advent and the protracted nature of the pandemic, given the closure of many consulate offices and delays in processing documents, many IMG physicians faced challenges in starting their residency, continuing their training or practice, and transitioning from training to practice.\n\nThe AMA has a COVID-19 resource page for IMG physicians where these challenges are outlined, and the efforts made by the AMA to resolve these problems are listed. Please refer to the COVID-19 resources for IMGs for more information.\n\nWhat is the scope of practice on an H-1B visa?\n\nIMG physicians are restricted to practice only in the location mentioned on their non-immigrant petition and the labor condition application. The employer is required to report any additional work location to the USCIS. They might need to amend the petition when the IMG physician is asked to provide clinical care in any service or program located at a different address.\n\nJ-1 visa for physicians J-1 visa for physicians\n\nMost residency programs offer physicians a J-1 visa, a type of exchange visitor visa sponsored by a centralized organization ECFMG. ECFMG is the only sponsor of a J-1 visa for physicians in clinical training programs (residency and fellowship), though universities can occasionally sponsor a J-1 visa for specific research track positions. The J-1 visa is renewed every year with a DS-2019 form from the ECFMG.\n\nA Statement of Need (SON) is needed from the physician's home country, stating the need for specialty training. When transitioning from residency to fellowship, on a J-1 visa, the physicians are responsible for gathering a new SON from their home country for the fellowship program. The programs have a designated person in the Graduate Medical Education (GME) who works with the trainee to secure all requirements and coordination with the ECFMG. Until now, J-1 visas were issued for a \"duration of status,\" enabling the physician to continue their training through each year of residency or fellowship without any disruption or the need to visit their home country. Training program rotations are not built in a way to allow weeks of absence for trainees.\n\nHowever, with a recent change of rule by the USCIS, the \"duration of status\" advantage might not be available going forward, posing a challenge for the trainees. The AMA, along with the ECFMG, NRMP, Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), and American Hospital Association (AHA), have recently urged the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to exclude medical trainees from the change of \"duration of status\" model.\n\nThe ECFMG Exchange Visitor Sponsorship Program is the one-stop source of information for physicians' J-1 visa. The criteria for obtaining a J-1 visa for physicians includes:\n\nUSMLE Step 1 and 2 must be cleared\n\nECFMG certification is needed\n\nThe candidate has an offer letter or a contract of a training program through the Graduate Medical Education (for residency or fellowship training)\n\nThe candidate obtains a statement of need from the country of last permanent residence\n\nObtaining a J-1 visa Obtaining a J-1 visa\n\nThe ECFMG is authorized by the U.S. Department of State to sponsor foreign national physicians for the J-1 visa. Information on eligibility and deadlines is available from ECFMG's Exchange Visitor Sponsorship Program.\n\nTo apply for a J-1 visa, an IMG must meet the following criteria:\n\nPassed USMLE\u00ae Step 1 and Step 2 CK (or equivalent)\n\nHave a valid ECFMG Certificate\n\nHave a contract or official letter of offer for a position in a program of Graduate Medical Education or training with a medical school\n\nProvide a statement of need from the Ministry of Health of the country of last legal permanent residence (LPR) regardless of country of citizenship\n\nTwo-year home country physical presence requirement Two-year home country physical presence requirement\n\nUpon completion of training in the U.S., J-1 visa holders must return to their home country for a period of two years to transmit the knowledge they gained in the U.S.\n\nAn individual must fulfill this obligation before being eligible for a change or adjustment of visa status to certain types of U.S. visas. These visa types include:\n\nH\u2013Temporary worker\n\nL\u2013Intra-company transferee\n\nU.S.\u2013Permanent resident\n\nJ-1 visa waivers J-1 visa waivers\n\nThe only exception to the two-year home residence requirement of the J-1 visa program is to receive a waiver.\n\nUnder the law, three circumstances can provide a waiver of the two-year residency requirement:\n\nThe waiver applicant can demonstrate that he or she will suffer from persecution in his or her home country or country of last legal permanent residence\n\nFulfillment of the residency requirement would bring proven exceptional hardship to the applicant's spouse and/or children who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents\n\nThe applicant is sponsored by an Interested Governmental Agency (IGA) that is interested in the physician\u2019s continued employment in the U.S.\n\nThe following governmental agencies have sponsored waivers for international medical graduates:\n\nOnce an international medical graduate receives a J-1 waiver and a state medical license, he or she may obtain a new work authorized status for U.S. employment, which in most cases will be an H-1B visa or an immigrant visa.\n\nInfluence AMA policy The International Medical Graduates Section (IMGS) gives voice to and advocates for issues that impact IMG physicians. Learn More\n\nFrequently asked questions about the J-1 visa Frequently asked questions about the J-1 visa\n\nHow to obtain a J-1 waiver for IMG physicians?\n\nThe J-1 visa is an exchange visitor program, subject to the \"home country\" rule of Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), Section 212(e). It means a physician on a J-1 visa must go back to their home country for two years before they would have to apply for another non-immigrant or immigrant visa to be able to practice in the U.S.\n\nIMG physicians are trained in U.S. programs funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and or the Veterans Administration (VA). They fill the discrepancy in physician workforce distribution in the rural and underserved areas; different options are available to waive the home country retirement and allow these physicians to continue serving the underserved communities.\n\nWaiver options are:\n\nDuring waiver, IMG physicians need to maintain an H-1B status to be able to practice. A waiver is a status ceding the two-year home country requirement, but a non-immigrant or an immigrant visa is required for the physicians to continue the practice.\n\nSubscribe and thrive in residency Get tips and insider advice from the AMA on navigating and making the most of medical residency\u2014delivered to your inbox. Subscribe Now\n\nAre academic jobs available on a J-1 waiver status?\n\nThe waiver status requires the physician to serve in the HPSA areas. If an academic institution is able to fulfill that requirement and willing to work with the state waiver officials, it is possible for them to hire a physician, as long as the state waiver requirements are met, and immigration status is maintained.\n\nHowever, many academic institutions might be unfamiliar with the process. Coordination between the state health office and state waiver official and the academic institution might facilitate this process.\n\nWhen to initiate the process of waiver?\n\nThe waiver process is lengthy and complicated. When an academic position is sought, the process might need even more time. Familiarizing with the waiver options and requirements should start at least a year or two before the end date of the training. Each state has a waiver application deadline. Waiver approval does not need state licensure but transitioning from training to practice needs a state license, and the process can be longer for IMGs.\n\nO-1 visa for physicians O-1 visa for physicians\n\nThe O-1A visa can be an option for IMG physicians' training and practice when the training program or an employer can apply. It is a less commonly used visa status for physicians on the clinical track. Still, it might be applicable for IMGs on a research track or IMGs with extraordinary abilities in the field of science. Though O-1 visas do not have the requirement for USMLE, state licensure still requires that all steps of USMLE be completed.\n\nTN visa for physicians TN visa for physicians\n\nThe TN visa is accessible to only Canadian and Mexican citizens qualified for full-time employment as professionals in an eligible field.

It also put on display a clash with a leftist leader of a country that had long been a U.S. partner against drug trafficking.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Monday the Trump administration will take action if countries do not abide by their agreements, such as accepting deportees.\n\n\u201cThis was about reminding Colombia that there is a price to pay if you go against your agreements, things that you promise,\u201d she said in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Story.\u201d \u201cUltimately, what one would expect to happen did happen.

Those who had their Monday appointments cancelled will likely have to wait several months for a new appointment.

There are skills-based green card pathways, but because of low annual caps and extensive backlogs, especially for people from high-sending countries like India and China, these take years to complete and are not viable for employers who need to hire immediately. Most highly skilled workers and graduates who want to stay and work in the U.S. long term will need to secure a temporary H-1B first, so they can begin working in a legal status while they \u201cget in line\u201d for a green card.7\n\nHowever, the H-1B program was never designed to be a talent retention program. It is too small, narrow, and outdated to effectively manage all of our skilled immigration needs, and these challenges can actually hold us back in the global race for talent.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is the low annual cap. With more than 400,000 people being registered in the lottery each year, the chances of being selected are less than 20%. And in recent years, nearly half of registrations have been for workers with advanced degrees from U.S. institutions. This means that each year, hundreds of thousands of international graduates with master\u2019s and PhDs from U.S. colleges and universities are shut out of the program before they can even apply.8 Many are already working through Optional Practical Training; if they cannot secure a visa, they have to leave their jobs and the U.S.\n\nEven if they win the lottery, H-1B status has significant limitations for visa holders and their employers. It is very difficult for visa holders to change their employer, location, or their job, including getting a promotion. Though they must renew their H-1B visa regularly, travel outside of the U.S. can be difficult and risky. Their spouses can apply for work authorization only in limited circumstances, and their children can age out of status and face deportation if they turn 21 before the green card process is completed.\n\nThings are even more challenging for visa holders who hope to stay in the U.S. permanently. As more people enter the H-1B program, the pool of those in \u201ctemporary\u201d status with limited agency increases significantly. But the number of available green cards is fixed by law and has not changed since 1990, so there will always be more people \u201cgetting in line\u201d than getting out, and wait times get longer and longer.",

But this figure has dwindled in recent years in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nIt is part of the wider economic hardship the country has been facing. Interest rate hikes fuelled by high inflation have seen economic growth in the country stagnate, leading to a rise in unemployment and the number of people seeking jobs abroad.\n\nNew Zealand is the latest among a number of countries that have introduced visa programmes for digital nomads over the past few years - appealing to an increase in people seeking opportunities to travel while working remotely.\n\nThe trend took off in the 2010s, mostly among young workers who were looking to escape their daily routine. It was further bolstered by the Covid-19 pandemic, when worldwide lockdowns led to a shift in attitudes toward remote work.\n\nCountries offering digital nomad visas include Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Spain and Portugal.\n\nBut the presence of digital nomads in some places has also sparked debate. In the South African city of Cape Town, detractors say the influx of remote workers has led to an increase in costs.\n\nThe influx of visitors to countries such as Spain and Greece have also fuelled heated protests against over-tourism.",

            "content": "PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. \u2014 The crackdown on illegal immigration is spotlighting a federal program that helps bring foreign farmworkers to the United States legally through the H-2A visa program, a way for people to work on farms temporarily in the country.\n\nWPTV turned to the President of Roth Farms, Rick Roth, who said the pro is that people working the fields are here legally filling a big need, but that the con is that it\u2019s getting more expensive to hire these workers and that demand has left fewer workers to go around.\n\n\"What limits us on our production is labor,\" Roth said. \u201cNobody wants to work as farmworkers harvesting crops in the United States.\u201d\n\nWATCH: WPTV Reporter Joel Lopez speaks to Roth Farms President Rick Roth on the impacts of H-2A visas\n\nWhat is the H-2A visa program and how is it affecting local farmworkers?\n\nRoth said he turned to foreign workers with H-2A visas about four years ago.\n\n\"We grow about 2,000 acres of vegetable of which lettuce is probably 20%,\" Roth said. \"That is all harvested by hand. You need hand labor to do it and that's why we're using the H-2A program.\"\n\nThe program cost Roth nearly $3 million this season, a record as he covers transportation and housing for 114 migrant workers.\n\nHe said every year the hourly rate increases. Add on the rising cost of rising of boxes, fuels and fertilizers, which has left him having to raise the raise of some produce.\n\n\"The ask would be to modify the H-2A program, to have it moved from the Department of Labor to the Department of Agriculture, make it user-friendly for agriculture, flatten out the increases,\" Roth said. \"We want more workers through the legal process.\"\n\nData from the U.S. Department of State shows the number of H-2A visas has increased every year since 2019. In 2023, the U.S. Government issued roughly 310,000 visas for undocumented workers. That\u2019s just a fraction of the 3.2 million people agents encountered that same year at U.S. Borders.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t there more immigrants that come through the H-2A visa?\u201d asked WPTV's Joel Lopez to crew leader Juan Lara Leon.\n\n\u201cBecause there aren\u2019t enough visas for everyone,\" Leon said.\n\nLeon said many farms aren't getting the number of workers they're requesting as demand has strained the number of available workers, and immigration crackdowns have taken a hit on farms that relied on undocumented farmworkers.\n\n\u201cPeople that haven\u2019t been taken are choosing to leave because of fear of deportation,\u201d Leon said.\n\nLeon said the staff at Roth Farms have H-2A visas, and that they keep their documents on property in case immigration agents question their status.\n\n\"Hopefully President Trump, now that it's his term, can figure out how to bring more people through the program,\" Leon said.\n\nIn a 2020 survey, the National Agricultural Workers Organization found the U.S. had about 2.4 million farmworkers, and 44% were undocumented.",

But because the U.S. lacks a diplomatic presence in Kabul, Afghans must first travel to third-party countries for processing before they can be granted new lives in America.\n\nIn addition to Germany, Albania and Qatar have also been used to evacuate Afghans.\n\nHousing units used for sheltering Afghan evacuees are pictured at Rhine Ordnance Barracks in Kaiserslautern, Germany, on Jan. 15, 2025. All Afghan special immigrant visa applicants who were living at ROB have departed. (Lara Korte/Stars and Stripes)\n\nSpecial immigrant visas are available to Afghans who worked with U.S. forces during the nearly 20-year war in roles such as interpreters, drivers and advisers. Because of their former affiliation, they face an increased risk of retaliation from the Taliban.\n\nIn the initial stages of evacuation, after the U.S.-backed Afghan administration collapsed in the summer of 2021, both Ramstein Air Base and Rhine Ordnance Barracks were used as support sites for the applicants.\n\nResettlement work later was stopped at both installations but resumed solely at ROB in 2023.\n\nEligible Afghans were flown to Kaiserslautern and sheltered in containerized housing units along a stretch of the autobahn A6 until they were ready to depart, having secured their special immigrant visa.\n\nThe last Afghan SIV seeker at the base left sometime in early to mid-January, the American advocate said.\n\nThe State Department declined to answer questions about the recent SIV assistance efforts in Kaiserslautern, citing a need to protect the privacy of those involved.\n\nAfghan men play volleyball without a net in a concrete courtyard at Rhine Ordnance Barracks in Kaiserslautern, Germany, in 2021. The Army installation housed more than 3,000 Afghan evacuees before resettlement in the U.S. began. The last Afghan special immigrant visa applicants have now departed ROB. (Stars and Stripes)\n\nSince 2021, the overall operation has resettled more than 180,000 Afghans, according to the State Department.\n\nWith Germany no longer playing a role in the process, the Philippines has joined the mix of third-party countries taking in Afghan SIV applicants.\n\nBut headwinds in Washington have added to the applicants\u2019 travails.\n\nA recent executive order signed by President Donald Trump halting foreign aid suspended the Afghan SIV program, according to #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit coalition spearheading the effort.\n\nThe order has stranded thousands of Afghan families abroad because the State Department can\u2019t book flights for the SIV seekers, according to the group.\n\nAlso, services at third-country platforms have been halted, as have federal assistance to newly arrived SIV holders and support in finding housing and enrolling their children in school, the group said.",

However, less than an hour later the tweet was deleted, and another one was sent, emphasizing the need for the US government to implement \u201cdignified treatment protocols\u201d for Colombian nationals before they would be accepted back. \u201cThe United States cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals. I deauthorize the entry of US planes with Colombian migrants into our territory,\u201d said Petro.\n\nThe reversal triggered a quick reaction from the US government. According to journalist Juan Camilo Merlano of popular Colombian news program Noticias Caracol, sources close to the US administration revealed plans for retaliatory measures. The immediate step was the suspension of visa services in Colombia.\n\n\u201cIn response to President Petro\u2019s refusal to accept two deportation flights, which he had previously approved at the highest instances of government, the US Embassy in Colombia will close its visa section starting January 27.

Sarabia stated that the government remains open to dialogue with the United States but emphasized the need for humane and respectful deportation protocols.\n\n\u201cThe Colombian government reaffirms its commitment to ensuring a dignified return for our nationals. We seek respectful, humane treatment and adequate conditions, including civil and dignified transportation.

He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nWe recently published a list of 11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

Whilst Elon Musk of Tesla advocates for the programme as a means to recruit qualified tech professionals, other supporters contend it diminishes job opportunities for American workers.Trump also highlighted his familiarity with the H-1B programme, citing his personal experience in utilising it for various positions including Ma\u00eetre d', wine specialists, and high-calibre waiters. He emphasised the technology sector's crucial need for engineers, specifically mentioning the requirements of business leaders like Larry and Masa.\"We want competent people coming into our country.

            "content": "As United States President Donald Trump issued an executive order to end birthright citizenship granted to US-born children, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has slammed it expressing concerns about the potential impact. Opposing the executive order, Khanna argued that the move is likely to hit not only illegal immigrants from around the world but \u201cto 'lawful' immigrants who are temporarily on a student visa, H1B/H2B visa, or business visa\u201d.\n\nDonald Trump News LIVE Taking to X, Khanna said, \u201cTrump's order removes birthright citizenship for children born in the US not just to undocumented parents but to 'lawful' immigrants who are temporarily on a student visa, H1B/H2B visa, or business visa. So much for the pretence that the Republicans are for legal immigration.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Just like father Donald Trump, son Barron Trump to launch real estate company\n\nWhat is Birthright Citizenship? US birthright citizenship is a legal principle which automatically guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States, whether their parents are US citizens or not. As per the birthright citizenship, a child of people in the United States on a tourist visa (or present illegally) will be a US citizen, if he or she is born in the country.\n\nWhat does Donald Trump's new executive order on Birthright Citizenship state? Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on birthright citizenship states that the US would not give automatic citizenship to newborn babies after February 19, 2025, if one of the parents is not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. It also stops federal agencies from issuing or recognising relevant documentation proving US citizenship for such children. The order targets children born to both unauthorised immigrants and people who are legally in the US on temporary visas.\n\nWhy attorneys general from 22 states sued President Trump? After the executive order, attorneys general from 22 states sued President Trump in two federal district courts on Tuesday to block the executive order, the New York Times reported. Eighteen states and two cities, San Francisco and Washington, DC, challenged the order in the Federal District Court in Massachusetts, arguing that birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment is \u201cautomatic\u201d and that neither the president nor Congress has the constitutional authority to revise it.\n\nImpact of the new executive order on Indian-Americans The new law will impact individuals legally residing in the U.S., including tourists, students, and those on temporary work visas such as H-1B. It is also expected to affect over a million Indians who are currently in the process of awaiting green cards. According to 2024 reports from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, more than a million Indians are waiting for their green card applications to be processed.\n\nAccording to TOI report, Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for children of H1B visa holders will impact their future. Without automatic citizenship, these children may lose access to in-state tuition, scholarships, and federal aid, potentially forcing many to abandon their college dreams.",

Triantaphyllis\n\nOn January 20 and 21, 2025, President Trump declared a national emergency and issued several executive orders on immigration. The Declaration and Executive Orders address \u201cenhanced vetting\u201d of visa applicants, birthright citizenship, border security, the U.S.\u2011Mexico-Canada Agreement, asylum, and refugee program. Here is a summary of some of the Executive Orders and their potential impact on employers and foreign nationals.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis order directs DHS and Department of State to implement stricter \u201cenhanced vetting\u201d for visa applicants and those already in the country.\n\nThe order directs all agencies to be thorough in vetting during visa issuing process.\n\nPotential impact:\n\nThere is a higher likelihood that foreign nationals applying for visas at U.S. Consulates and Embassies abroad will be put in administrative processing. Moreover, it is likely that scheduling visa appointments will be backlogged and/or suspended for extended periods.\n\nDuring visa interviews, foreign nationals born in \u201chigh-risk\u201d countries will likely encounter heightened scrutiny, regardless of their current country of nationality or citizenship. Foreign nationals may also be asked about their ties to the \u201chigh-risk\u201d countries.\n\nWe anticipate more delays in visa issuances due to administrative processing and additional security clearances.\n\nWe expect partial or full \u201ctravel bans\u201d from countries identified by the Trump administration as \u201chigh risk\u201d countries.\n\nDue to the inter-agency nature of the Order, it is likely more Requests for Evidence (\u201cRFE\u201d) and denials will be issued for filings made with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis Executive Order limits birthright citizenship. To acquire U.S. citizenship automatically, children born on or after February 19, 2025, in the U.S. must have at least one parent who is a Legal Permanent Resident (green card holder) or a U.S. citizen.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nIf both parents are unlawfully present in the U.S. or are on temporary visas or are in the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program, their children, born on or after February 19, 2025, would not acquire U.S. citizenship. These children may have to apply for a dependent visa, based on their parents\u2019 visas and nonimmigrant status. USCIS will have to provide direction on how to determine the child\u2019s nationality and their country of birth/country of chargeability for immigrant visa purposes. Temporary visas include: B-1, B-2, E-2, H-1B, J-1, L-1, O-1, TN, and their corresponding dependent visas.\n\nThus far, 24 U.S. states, 2 U.S. cities, and civil rights organizations have initiated lawsuits to challenge this Executive Order.\n\nOn January 23, 2025, the US District Court for the Western District of Washington issued a Temporary Restraining Order blocking the implementation of this Executive Order for 14 days. We will continue to monitor and provide updates on all pending litigation.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Declaration and Executive Order direct the use of armed forces, additional physical barriers, unmanned aerial systems, and a revision of policies and strategies aimed to impede and deny unauthorized entry into the southern border of the United States.\n\nThe Executive Order also directs DHS to use available technologies to determine the validity of familial relationships between foreign nationals.\n\nThe Executive Order ends CBP One and parole program, \u201cProcesses for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.\u201d\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nWe expected increased wait times and heightened scrutiny at ports of entry.\n\nEmployers and foreign nationals should plan for potential delays when foreign nationals are entering the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nForeign nationals should be ready to present documentation confirming their relationship to their dependents.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis order specifically reviews the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSCMA\u201d) as well as other U.S. trade agreements.\n\nIt directs the US Trade Representative to review and renegotiate or withdraw from agreements that disadvantage American workers and businesses.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nAlthough no immediate impact is expected, the USCMA agreement includes provisions authorizing the TN visa. TN visa applicants should expect heightened scrutiny at the time of their interview.\n\nThe direction to review other trade agreements could impact other treaty-based nonimmigrant visas, such as E-1 (treaty trader), E-2 (treaty investor), E-3 (Specialty Occupation Workers form Australia) and H-1B1 (specialty occupation worker from Chile and Singapore). We do not anticipate the above programs to be affected; however, we will continue to monitor developments and provide updates.\n\nSummary:\n\nDHS is to set new enforcement policies to address illegal entry, unlawful presence, and removal of those unlawfully present in the U.S.\n\nDHS is to expand the use of expedited removal.\n\nThe Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and DHS are to limit humanitarian parole, designations of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and employment authorization.\n\nUndocumented aliens must register their presence. Failure to comply is to be treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority.\n\n\u201cSanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that interfere with federal enforcement operations will be denied access to federal funds.\n\nDHS may authorize state and local law enforcement officials to investigate, apprehend, and detain aliens.\n\nThis Executive Order revokes Biden-era Executive Orders, related to Civil Immigration Enforcement Policies, Migration and Asylum Seekers, Reunification of Families, and Immigration Policies Impeding Legal Immigration. All agencies are to revoke guidance or policies that were issued based on the Executive Orders.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nTPS and Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) based on TPS will likely not be extended. USCIS is not likely to issue policies allowing for automatic extensions of EADs for TPS beneficiaries.\n\nIf DHS delegates its authority to state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, there is a higher likelihood of foreign nationals being asked about their immigration status. Foreign nationals should have their immigration documents evidencing their lawful status readily available.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Trump Administration has declared an ongoing \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants at the southern border. The Executive Order invokes Article IV of the Constitution to prohibit the entry of any person, including asylum seekers, at the southern border.\n\nDHS and the Secretary of State may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis.\n\nExecutive Order 14013, Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration, is revoked.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nDHS will block asylum seekers and any other individuals\u2019 entries into the United States at the southern border.\n\nWe anticipate there will be legal challenges given the Immigration and National Act\u2019s (INA) guarantee of access to asylum.\n\nSummary:\n\nSuspension of USRAP will take effect on January 27, 2025, until DHS advises whether USRAP should resume.\n\nDHS and the Secretary of State may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis.\n\nExecutive Order 14013, Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration, is revoked.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nDHS decisions on applications for refugee status are suspended until DHS advises otherwise.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis Executive Order rescinded 78 executive orders and presidential memoranda signed by former President Biden.\n\nThe immigration-related executive orders that have been rescinded are: Executive Order 13993, Revision of Civil Immigration Enforcement Policies and Priorities. Executive Order 14010, Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework To Address the Causes of Migration, To Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and To Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border. Executive Order 14011, Establishment of Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families.

            "content": "SANTA ANA, Calif. \u2013 A federal judge here Monday sentenced a Korea-born pastor who operated a now defunct Orange County religious university to one year in prison and ordered him to forfeit to the government the $4 million property housing the school following his conviction on visa fraud and money laundering charges.\n\nSamuel Chai Cho Oh, 66, who owned and operated California Union University (CUU) in Fullerton, Calif., pleaded guilty Jan. 13 to 10 counts of visa fraud and two counts of money laundering. In addition to one year in prison, U.S. District Judge James V. Selna also sentenced Oh to one year of home confinement. As part of his plea, Oh also agreed to forfeit another $418,000 in proceeds from the visa fraud scheme that had been laundered through a church he was affiliated with and a Chinese restaurant owned by a friend.\n\nThe case stems from an investigation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) with substantial assistance provided by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service.\n\n\"The court order requiring Mr. Oh to turn over nearly $4.5 million worth of property and assets to the government makes this one of the largest forfeiture actions ever imposed in the Los Angeles area in a visa fraud case,\" said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge for ICE Homeland Security Investigations in Los Angeles. \"Today's sentencing should serve as a warning to those who manipulate our legal immigration system to enrich themselves - if you're caught, you stand not only to lose your freedom, but also any profits you reaped from those crimes.\"\n\nHSI agents say CUU served as a front for an elaborate student visa fraud scheme, with Oh handing out phony diplomas and staging actual graduation ceremonies. According to case affidavits, a confidential source familiar with Oh's business dealings said the pastor collected $40,000 to $50,000 a month in fees from foreign \"students\" who received Form I-20s from CUU certifying their eligibility for academic study. The Form I-20 enables prospective students to go to a U.S. Embassy or consulate abroad and apply for a student visa. Until October 2009, when its federal certification was revoked, CUU was authorized by the Department of Homeland Security to accept foreign students pursuing an education in religious and biblical studies, English as a Second Language (ESL) and Oriental medicine.\n\n\"Our fraud detection officers work collaboratively with ICE HSI to investigate fraudulent conduct that jeopardizes the integrity of our immigration system,\" said Jane Arellano, district director for USCIS in Los Angeles. \"This case is a great example of the success our collaboration can achieve.\"\n\nDuring the investigation, which began in April 2009, ICE agents arrested and questioned more than 30 foreign nationals who stated they paid Oh fees of up to $10,000 for documentation enabling them to fraudulently obtain student visas and, in some cases, bogus degrees. The \"students\" admitted they never attended class, nor did they ever see any teachers or students on the CUU campus.\n\nIn October 2009, ICE agents executed a search warrant at the school, seizing computers and more than 300 student files. A review of that evidence showed that while the majority of CUU's enrollees were Korean, the school's student body included foreign nationals from more than 20 countries.\n\nWhen ICE agents and a compliance team from the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) paid an unannounced visit to the CUU campus in March 2009, the school had more than 300 students on its rolls. According to the case affidavit, Oh conceded during that visit that three-quarters of the school's students did not attend class regularly and he could only produce course schedules for computer and ESL classes, even though the school was certified to accept foreign students in several other disciplines, including religious studies and Oriental medicine.",

All other employment-based categories will continue to hold steady for February.\n\nEMPLOYMENT-BASED (EB) PRIORITY DATE SUMMARY FOR FINAL ACTION DATES\n\nUSCIS confirmed that it will honor the Final Action Dates chart for purposes of eligibility to file an Adjustment of Status application.

Employers should expect slower processing and delays, possible work authorization challenges, as well as probable impacts to retention and strategic workforce planning, as further detailed below:\n\nSlower Processing and Delays : Higher demand can lead to processing backlogs and delays for employees waiting for their green card approvals.\n\n: Higher demand can lead to processing backlogs and delays for employees waiting for their green card approvals.

            "content": "Wall Street's bulls expect the card processor's stock to head even higher.\n\nVisa (V 0.99%) is often considered a stable long-term investment. It owns one of the world's largest card payment processing networks, it has consistently grown through economic downturns, and its stock has risen more than 400% over the past 10 years.\n\nWall Street remains upbeat about its future. Of the 37 analysts who cover Visa, 30 rate it as a buy, seven rate it as a hold, and none rate it as a sell. It's also still trading well below the Street's highest price target of $378 -- which was set by Bernstein's Harshita Rawat earlier this month.\n\nRawat expects Visa's international expansion and some currency tailwinds from a weaker U.S. dollar to offset its slower domestic growth. In the U.S. market, she expects the company's card volume growth to hold steady even as inflation stays sticky.\n\nRawat also notes that Visa could benefit from more relaxed regulations under the Trump Administration, and its stock is still trading at historically low valuations. So, should investors buy Visa's stock before it hits her price target?\n\nWhat has happened to Visa over the past few years?\n\nVisa, like its primary competitor Mastercard (MA 1.50%), doesn't issue any credit and debit cards on its own. It only partners with banks and other financial institutions to issue Visa-branded cards, and those partners actually handle all those accounts.\n\nVisa is only responsible for routing card payments through its global processing network, and it charges a swipe fee of about 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction. It splits those fees with the card issuers and keeps the rest as its revenue. That lightweight business model lets the company expand quickly without taking on too much credit risk.\n\nVisa and Mastercard hold a near-duopoly in card-based payments -- even as Capital One tries to acquire the distant underdog Discover to build its own payment processing network -- so their merchants generally agree to pay their swipe fees to serve a broader range of customers. These two market leaders also can't be easily disrupted by digital payment apps, since most of those wallets still need to be linked to a debit or credit card.\n\nFrom fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended in September 2024), Visa's revenue had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% as its earnings per share (EPS) had a CAGR of 13%. It achieved that stable growth even as the global economy was rattled by the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, soaring inflation, and rising interest rates.\n\nWhat will happen to Visa over the next few years?\n\nVisa's business model is resilient, but investors shouldn't ignore its long-term challenges. Over the past two decades, it has faced constant pressure from merchants to reduce its swipe fees. Visa and Mastercard agreed to reduce their fees to appease those merchants last year, but a U.S. judge rejected that settlement last June because the cuts weren't deep enough.\n\nUnder the Biden Administration, the Federal Reserve passed Regulation II, which requires merchants to offer a third option for processing debit card transactions on a network that isn't Visa or Mastercard. The Justice Department also sued Visa last September for \"monopolizing\" over 60% of the country's debit transactions.\n\nThose regulatory challenges cast a dark cloud over its U.S. business, which was already growing at a much slower rate than its international business.\n\nVisa could also face unpredictable macro challenges. The Fed plans to slow down its interest rate cuts this year, which suggests inflation hasn't been tamed yet. Meanwhile, the stubbornly strong U.S. dollar could offset a lot of its overseas growth.\n\nYet those headwinds could dissipate under the Trump Administration, which favors a weaker dollar and plans to relax regulations on U.S. companies. If Visa overcomes those challenges and the macro environment warms up again, its growth will likely stabilize over the next few years. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Visa's revenue and EPS to have a CAGR of 10% and 13%, respectively.\n\nIs it the right time to buy Visa stock?\n\nAt $323, the stock looks reasonably valued at 26 times next year's earnings. But at $378, the highest analyst's price target, it would trade at 30 times that estimate. I think Visa is still worth buying today before it hits that target, but I would be wary of buying it at higher prices. The company is a solid long-term investment, but investors should carefully assess its regulatory and macro challenges before loading up on its stock.",

Among those affected are the more than 1,600 Afghans cleared to resettle in the U.S.\n\nPakistan says it is yet to receive any official information from the United States about the suspension. Afghans who are in the country were supposed to be relocated by September 2025.\n\nThe program was set up to help Afghans at risk under the Taliban because of their work with the U.S. government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. The U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021 when the Taliban took power.\n\nBut in its first days in office, Trump\u2019s administration announced the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program would be suspended from Jan. 27 for at least three months.\n\nShah said most of the Afghans who are in transit to the United States were now living in a very difficult conditions. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live here permanently. We urge the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to order authorities to extend the visas of Afghan people for at least six months,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also urged the United Nations refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration to help Afghans who are waiting for relocation. \u201cIf the UNHCR and IOM don\u2019t help us in this difficult situation, who will rise his or her voice for us?\u201d Shah said.\n\nMeanwhile, there is uncertainty among many over their future.\n\nDozens of Afghan women holding placards gathered in Islamabad to discuss the situation. They urged Trump to restore the refugee program and asked Pakistan to ease restrictions on them.\n\n\u201cWe have no other choice except to go to the United States, as we have lost everything here. We request Trump that we are in very difficult times and we have nothing to survive,\u201d said Saanga Bibi, a widow. She said her family is compelled to skip either lunch or dinner to save money for the fees to extend their visas each month.\n\nAnother woman, Bibi Habiba, asked Pakistan reduce the exorbitant visa fee, saying, \u201cWe want nothing more than that.\u201d\n\nThe advocacy group said Afghan risked their lives to serve as interpreters, contractors, human rights defenders, and allies of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. \u201cThe Taliban view us as enemies, and returning to Afghanistan would mean arrest, torture, or death,\u201d it said in an appeal to Trump, rights defenders and U.S. authorities.\n\n\u201cThis suspension breaks the promises made to those who stood by the United States,\u201d it said.\n\nSarfraz Ahmed, a journalist who fled to Pakistan from Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power, said Friday he had been expecting to receive a call confirming his travel plans, but the suspension changed everything.\n\nKhalid Khan, a former Afghan army captain who worked for the Afghan air force and helped the U.S. air force during operations against the Afghan Taliban and other groups, fled his country along with his family in 2023. \u201cI will be in a trouble if I am sent back to Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said there is an agreement with Washington to take Afghans who are in Pakistan to the United States for resettlement by September 2025.\n\n\u201cThe arrangements are in place. We have, so far officially, not received any further information on this issue,\u201d ministry spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan told a news briefing in Islamabad on Thursday.\n\nThe Taliban has deprived 1.4 million Afghan girls of schooling through bans, according to the United Nations. Afghanistan is the only country in the world that bans female secondary and higher education.",

            "content": "Visa\u2019s acquisition of the core banking and payments software business Pismo has accelerated the Brazilian start-up\u2019s worldwide expansion.\n\nBeing acquired by the credit card network last year has been \u201ctransformative\u201d for the S\u00e3o Paulo-based business, said Vishal Dalal, the company\u2019s CEO of the North America. Visa has paved the way for Pismo to add clients in Europe, and strike up conversations with potential customers there and elsewhere, he said.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition by Visa helped us a lot, in the sense that Visa has almost unlimited resources, both in terms of financials, and in terms of reach,\u201d Dalal said in an interview this month, describing how Visa has connected Pismo to more banks that are seeking to upgrade or replace their software infrastructure.\n\nPismo offers its core banking and payments software services via the cloud, specifically Amazon Web Services, allowing banks of all sizes to pick what software services they want. The company was founded in 2016 by Ricardo Josua in Brazil.\n\nWhen Visa announced its acquisition of Pismo last year, it said it would keep on the management team led by Josua, who remains CEO and is based in Brazil, according to his LinkedIn profile. Meanwhile, Dalal holds the CEO title for North America as well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nJust before Pismo was acquired by Visa, it landed a contract in June last year to provide to service corporate demand deposit accounts for Citigroup, one of the largest banks in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to offering services in Brazil, Pismo also already has customers in India and Australia.\n\nNow, Visa\u2019s sales team is pitching Pismo services to banks all over the world. While the companies are nearly finished integrating Pismo\u2019s services into the Visa\u2019s services offering, the Brazilian\u2019s software engineering and product units continue to operate separately, Dalal said.\n\nWhile Pismo had no customers in Europe before the purchase by Visa, it\u2019s now stacking them up.\n\n\u201cIn Europe, I think it's safe to say, we had nothing,\u201d Dalal said. \u201cJust the Visa name has essentially taken us to a point where we're already live with one major bank, we're sort of implementing three others, and we've got tens of conversations going on.\u201d\n\nHe said there are a similar number of customer conversations, about 15 to 20, happening in the U.S. as well. Dalal declined to name the banks with which the company is doing business, or having conversations.\n\nLast year, Pismo also renewed its contract with its flagship bank client in Brazil, Ita\u00fa, the largest bank in that country, Visa CEO, Ryan McInerney, noted on a company earnings call in October. The card network giant has similarly ambitious plans for Pismo this year, with plans to add customers in five countries in four regions, McInerney said.\n\nBy way of Pismo, Visa even services banks that are aligned with its U.S. network rival Mastercard.\n\n\u201cYou can just imagine the [total addressable market] that we're able to go after when we're not just delivering services for Visa transactions, but we're able to work with clients to deliver services on top of a much broader array of payment transactions,\u201d McInerney said during the call, referencing Pismo and other Visa platforms through which the card network is increasingly offering complementary services.\n\nWith many financial institutions that issue cards seeking to upgrade their legacy computer systems for the modern era, and also to issue their cards in other regions of the world, Pismo will be well-positioned to offer services covering credit, debit and commercial transactions with connectivity to local payment systems, McInerney said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is for Pismo to be the platform of choice for our issuing partners around the world enabling them to accelerate their global expansion and transition to cloud-native platforms,\u201d McInerney said on an earnings call in January 2024 shortly after Visa closed the Pismo acquisition.\n\nWhile Pismo represents a market opportunity for Visa, it may mean more competition for the other major U.S. core provider processors, such as Fiserv, Fidelity National Information Services and Jack Henry & Associates.\n\nBut Pismo is carving out a sweet spot in targeting larger banks, while those U.S. competitors largely cater to financial institutions in the mid-sized range, with deposits of between $250 million and $25 billion in assets, said David Koning, an analyst at the investment firm R.W. Baird who follows the sector. By comparison, Citi has about $2.4 trillion in assets, according to an earnings release this month.\n\n\u201cIt seems like Pismo goes after quite large banks,\u201d Koning said, noting that he hasn\u2019t followed Pismo\u2019s business closely. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to go into the market where [Fiserv and Jack Henry] play in particular, given the $250m-$25b banks don\u2019t like to change core providers.\u201d",

            "content": "Spain is officially ending its \u201cgolden visa\u201d program on April 3, 2025, the country\u2019s government confirmed in a January decree.\n\nFormally known as residency-by-investment schemes, so-called golden visas give legal residence rights to foreign citizens who, in exchange, make an investment in the host country. Depending on the country, this investment can take the form of a real estate purchase, philanthropic donation, a lump sum payment, or other monetary contribution.\n\nThe visas\u2014especially those that provide the ability to travel freely through Europe\u2019s Schengen Area\u2014have become increasingly popular among Americans looking to move abroad. However, programs offering visas in exchange for real estate purchases have become politically controversial in recent years due to fears that they are contributing to rising housing costs.\n\nSpain's golden visa, officially named an investor visa, allows non-EU citizens who invest at least 500,000 euros ($541,250) in real estate to live and work in the country for three years. On average, the visa application takes between three and six months to be processed, according to global investment migration firm Astons.\n\n\"Today, 94 out of every 100 such visas are linked to real estate investment...in major cities that are facing a highly stressed market and where it's almost impossible to find decent housing for those who already live, work and pay their taxes there,\" Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in April 2024, per Reuters.\n\nDigital Nomads: Are They Crowding Destinations or Reviving Them? If it's up to these forward thinking organizations, it's the latter.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2023, Spain granted a total of 14,576 golden visas, the majority of which were given to citizens of China, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Ukraine, Iran, Venezuela, and Mexico, according to a government press release. In Barcelona, housing purchases linked to golden visas accounted for 5.3% of the city's annual residential sales.\n\n\u201cThe decision to call time on Spain's golden visa program has been largely down to the growing housing crisis being seen across the domestic housing market,\u201d Alena Lesina, a real estate investment expert at Astons, tells Traveler in an emailed statement. \u201cThere has been an increase in the number of Spanish citizens being forced out of neighborhoods in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona due to housing market inflation and the Spanish government believes that non-resident property buyers are one of the driving factors behind this issue.\u201d\n\nFollowing Spain\u2019s decision to end its program, there has been a surge in interest from Americans for both Spanish and Greek golden visas, according to a January analysis by Astons.\n\nSince the Spanish government first announced it would terminate its golden visa scheme in April 2024, the number of Americans applying to Greece's golden visa has steadily increased from 302 per month to 383 per month as of November 2024 (the most recent monthly total available), government data shows.\n\n\u201cWith Spain announcing the end to its golden visa, the clock is now ticking and US citizens are looking for a plan B destination in Europe,\u201d Lesina says. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s clear that Americans are already diverting their attention to Greece which is rapidly becoming the most in-demand golden-visa destination in Europe.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the different ways Americans can move abroad, check out our guides to digital nomad visas, the easiest countries to get second passports, and how to get citizenship through ancestry.",

The requirement for a minimum of five years of work experience in a relevant field has been removed for applicants in the Highly Skilled Professionals and Work-from-Thailand Professionals categories. For the Work-from-Thailand Professionals category, the corporate revenue requirement for overseas-based employers sponsoring an applicant has been lowered to a minimum of US$50 million over the last three years, down from US$150 million. For the Wealthy Global Citizens category, the minimum annual income requirement (US$80,000) has been removed. Finally, restrictions on the number of dependents will be eliminated (previously capped at four), allowing spouses, parents, children and legal dependents to be included for LTR visa holders.\n\n\n\nAdditional Information: The Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) is the agency in charge of screening applicants to the LTR visa program, which was first launched in September 2022. The BOI designed these updates and adjustments to facilitate access to a wider range of foreign experts, investors and executives so the country may boost talent pools and increase international competitiveness. As of the end of 2024, the BOI granted LTR visas to more than 6,000 applicants.\n\nThis alert has been provided by the BAL Global Practice Group.",

But the executive order also names children born to legal temporary visitors to the US \u2013 including those visiting the country on a study visa \u2013 as among those ineligible for birthright citizenship.\n\nThe order means that from February 19 children born in the US from people in the country on study visas will not automatically be granted citizenship. This extends to babies born to a couple where just one parent is not a US citizen or permanent resident.\n\nThe news has garnered significant concern among international stakeholders, with several Indian-American politicians vowing to fight the legislation.\n\n\u201cNo matter what Donald Trump says or does, birthright citizenship has and will be the law of the land. I will fight to protect it at all costs,\u201d said Michigan Congressman Shri Thanedar.\n\nThe legislation also faces legal opposition from 18 states, with California, Massachusetts, Washington and New York among those suing to block it from becoming law.\n\nNo matter what Donald Trump says or does, birthright citizenship has and will be the law of the land\n\nShri Thanedar, US Congressman\n\nIndia is a key source market for the US\u2019s international education sector, with more than 330,000 Indians heading to the country for study opportunities last year.\n\nThe enhanced vetting order marks a slight departure from Trump\u2019s pre-election stance on immigration rights for international students in the US.

            "content": "Visa (V) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis global payments processor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $9.34 billion, up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.22% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

The move also comes as the company, which offers a secure platform for digital asset transactions, looks to bridge the gap between the blockchain and traditional finance space \u2014 a goal where Prabhu\u2019s past experience will play a key role, the company said.\n\n\u201cWith his unmatched experience in scaling global payments networks and leading public companies, Vasant brings a unique perspective that aligns perfectly with Fireblocks\u2019 vision,\u201d Fireblocks CFO Michael Levine said of the appointment in a statement emailed to CFO Dive. \u201cVisa is the gold standard for networks, and as we build out the Fireblocks Network, Vasant\u2019s expertise will be invaluable in shaping our next phase of growth.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPrabhu \u2014 who previously served as Visa\u2019s CFO and vice chair for eight years, departing in 2023 \u2014 currently sits on the board for companies including software and tax service provider Intuit, Delta Airlines, consumer health firm Kenvue and the Brookings Institution. His past CFO roles also include a stint as finance chief for NBC Universal, Safeway and Starwood Hotels, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"The payments landscape is at a critical inflection point, and blockchain technology is the engine driving this transformation,\" Prabhu said in a statement included in the Wednesday release. Fireblocks is targeting continued expansion as it sees a surge in payments volume, reporting institutional transactions spiked by 85% year-over-year in 2024, according to its release.\n\nWith Prabhu the digital asset platform is gaining a veteran of a major credit card network player in the traditional financial markets at a time when cryptocurrency firms are looking to establish higher trust and credibility.\n\nIt also comes amid a swell of first-week actions by President Donald Trump, some focused on the cryptocurrency market. The president has pledged to take a friendlier approach to the industry, which has struggled to establish itself as a legitimate alternative to traditional finance among challenges related to its volatility, security, and concerns related to its use for fraud or money laundering.\n\nAmong other moves, Trump tapped cryptocurrency advocates for key roles including leadership of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 nominating crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins to serve as the SEC Chair, following the departure of Gary Gensler, CFO Dive previously reported. As Atkins awaits Senate confirmation, Trump on Tuesday appointed crypto-friendly Commissioner Mark Uyeda to serve as acting chair.\n\nIn a separate Tuesday release, the SEC also announced the creation of a \u201ccrypto task force\u201d to be led by fellow Commissioner Hester Peirce \u2014 who, alongside Uyeda, often dissented on the agency\u2019s crypto-related decisions under Gensler\u2019s leadership, CFO Dive previously reported. Gensler, who was often criticized by Republican politicians for his aggressive enforcement of crypto, officially departed from his role on Monday.\n\nHowever, some of Trump\u2019s actions surrounding crypto have already created some pushback among critics, who worry certain decisions by the president could harm, rather than help, the industry\u2019s much-needed credibility. In a move that has sparked both praise and critique, for example, Trump fulfilled a campaign pledge by issuing a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht also on Tuesday.\n\nThe founder of dark web marketplace Silk Road, which utilized cryptocurrency for the illegal sale of drugs, Ulbricht was convicted on seven charges including distributing narcotics, in federal court and has been serving a life sentence since 2015, according to a report by CNBC.\n\n\u201cI just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\u201d Trump wrote in a Tuesday post on Truth Social. \u201cThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me.\u201d",

            "content": "Takeaways\n\nUSCIS issued updated policy guidance on 1/15/25 on how it will evaluate candidates for EB-2 immigrant visas seeking a National Interest Waiver (NIW).\n\nUSCIS will be more closely scrutinizing a candidate\u2019s qualifications, profession, experience, and support letters.\n\nThese changes will make it more difficult to obtain NIWs in the future.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its policy guidance on Jan. 15, 2025, to clarify how it will evaluate candidates\u2019 eligibility for second preference employment based (EB-2) immigrant visa with a request for a National Interest Waiver (NIW). This update undoubtedly signals that the NIW process will be much more heavily vetted.\n\nGenerally, an employer files an EB-2 petition using Form I-140 after receiving a PERM labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). When an employer files the labor application with DOL for certification, it must attest that it will not displace any U.S. workers by hiring the foreign national, that such hiring will not adversely affect the job opportunities and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers, and that there are no able, qualified, and available U.S. workers. USCIS can waive the labor certification requirement, however, when a petitioner can show that doing so is in the United States\u2019 interest. Additionally, and critically, individuals seeking a NIW may do so without having an employer sponsor the petition.\n\nThe Jan. 15, 2025, guidance confirms that for advanced degree professionals seeking an NIW, USCIS will need confirmation that the occupation is a \u201cprofession\u201d and, if applicable, whether the requisite five years of post-bachelor\u2019s experience is in that specialty. For individuals who are seeking an NIW based on exceptional ability, USCIS will scrutinize each petition on a case-by-case basis to confirm the exceptional ability is directly related to the proposed endeavor.\n\nUSCIS\u2019 update also clarifies that the government will be taking a much closer look at the NIW petition supporting evidence. For example, the agency has expanded the list of information it hopes to see in letters of support and business plans. Further, USCIS has clarified that broad assertions about an individual\u2019s potential benefit to the economy will not be sufficient evidence. This is particularly true for entrepreneurs. An entire section in the guidance is dedicated to their applications.\n\nThe NIW had been viewed as an attractive alternative to the laborious and time-consuming PERM labor certification process. While still an appealing route, the USCIS update appears to have raised the standard for NIW approval. As we wait to see how the guidance will be implemented and applied by USCIS adjudicators, it will be crucial for petitioners and employers to consider the new update as they make NIW sponsorship decisions and work with counsel to prepare those cases.",

Countries classified by ICE as uncooperative are also known as recalcitrant. Factors that could lead to a country being classified as recalcitrant include hindering ICE removal efforts by refusing to take the appropriate steps, as described above.\n\nZadvydas v. Davis\n\nUncooperative countries significantly exacerbate the challenges presented to ICE by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that:\n\nWith narrow exceptions, aliens with final orders of removal \u2014 including aliens determined to pose threats to the community or considered flight risks \u2014 may not be detained by ICE beyond a presumptively reasonable period of six months if there is no \u201csignificant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future\u201d\n\nDelays in issuing travel documents or denying the acceptance of their nationals complicate ICE\u2019s removal efforts as the agency has been legally required to release thousands of aliens, including those with serious criminal convictions\n\nVisa Sanctions\n\nWhen specific countries deny or delay accepting their nationals with final orders of removal from the United States, the U.S. government may issue visa sanctions as a means of encouraging the recalcitrant country to cooperate. In accordance with Section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Secretary of Homeland Security notifies the Secretary of State that multiple governments have denied or unreasonably delayed the acceptance of a national or nationals ordered removed from the United States.\n\nAs a result, the Secretary of State may order U.S. consular officers at U.S. embassies and consulates in these countries to implement visa restrictions on certain categories of visa applicants. These sanctions may remain in place until the Secretary of Homeland Security notifies the Secretary of State that removal cooperation has improved to an acceptable level.",

            "content": "On Monday, January 20, the first day of the new presidential term, President Donald Trump issued a flurry of new executive orders1 related to immigration action items. Many of these orders address humanitarian and southern border immigration initiatives, as well as vetting and security procedures. We will focus on those orders that directly or tangentially affect U.S. employers.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nWhile the majority of the new executive orders do not outright impact employment-based immigration, certain employees or their families may be affected by changes to humanitarian immigration programs.\n\nOf note, the executive orders provide for enhanced vetting and screening initiatives of nonimmigrant and immigrant visa applicants (including those sponsored by employers) in countries with \u201cdeficient\u201d vetting and screening information, which sets the stage for stricter embassy policies (creating processing delays) and even upcoming travel bans for countries deemed to have deficient security/vetting information.\n\nThe orders may require government review of certain trade and treaty agreements that could impact future policies for certain visa-supported treaty workers.\n\nAs in 2017, the new orders put the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program on hold.\n\nThe orders also seek to end birthright citizenship in the United States, which could result in nonimmigrants being required to apply for dependent visas for children born in the United States.\n\nThe orders end a recent humanitarian-based \u201cparole\u201d program for certain nationalities that provided individuals with work authorization, and make other changes to the processing of asylum applications.\n\nThe orders also set enhanced enforcement priorities for prosecution of undocumented individuals present in the United States, including denying \u201csanctuary cities\u201d (jurisdictions that do not assist federal law enforcement in identifying undocumented individuals) access to federal funding to the maximum extent allowable by law.\n\nImmigration Executive Orders\n\nThe new immigration-related executive orders include the following:\n\nProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats: Order to direct federal agencies to identify countries that do not provide sufficient information on their nationals and to bar those nationals from U.S. entry.\n\nOne of the more relevant immigration orders for employers, \u201cProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats,\u201d provides for enhanced vetting and screening across federal agencies, particularly regarding the issuance of visas and the admissibility of visa applicants. It hints at a possible future ban on admission of nationals of certain countries found to have deficient vetting and screening information.\n\nThe order instructs the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Homeland Security to \u201cvet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States, particularly those aliens coming from regions or nations with identified security risks.\u201d The order goes on to require the secretary of state, the attorney general, the secretary of homeland security, and the director of national intelligence to provide a report \u201cidentifying countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)).\u201d\n\nThe order also requires evaluation of \u201call visa programs to ensure that they are not used by foreign nation-states or other hostile actors to harm the security, economic, political, cultural, or other national interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nGiven this increasingly strict language regarding secure vetting, we anticipate that U.S. embassies, which are the gatekeepers for visa processing outside the United States, particularly those located in countries with historically heightened security risks, may soon put into practice more stringent background checks and internal vetting procedures. This could slow down visa processing times at the U.S. embassies or lead to increased instances of visa applicants\u2019 cases being put into \u201cadministrative processing,\u201d (which is a State Department mechanism for more in-depth review of applications and occurs when more information is needed to verify applicants\u2019 backgrounds). Administrative processing can lead to delays of a few months or more.\n\nAmerica First Trade Policy: Order to direct U.S. trade policies that promote investment and productivity, including reviewing all existing trade agreements and the impact of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) agreement on American workers.\n\nThe executive order, \u201cAmerica First Trade Policy\u201d instructs agencies to re-evaluate current trade policy and could result in changes to eligibility and requirements for TN visas, which are commonly used by Canadian and Mexican workers to enter the United States in qualified professional occupations, pursuant to the USMCA. The order requires the United States trade representative, in consultation with the heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies, to \u201cassess the impact of the USMCA on American workers, farmers, ranchers, service providers, and other businesses and make recommendations regarding the United States\u2019 participation in the agreement.\u201d\n\nPotentially, the reassessment of other trade agreements could eventually affect other treaty-based visa categories, such as the E-1 visa for treaty traders, the E-2 visa for treaty investors, and the H-1B1 visa (Singapore and Chile specialty occupation workers),2 in view of potential adverse impact on American workers. The E-3 visa was created by an Act of Congress3 following the Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, although the visa provisions are not implemented by the agreement, so we anticipate that the E-3 classification will not be affected.\n\nNote that the H-1B specialty occupation program (for all other citizens) is not treaty-based, and therefore would not be reviewed as part of this new initiative.\n\nRealigning the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program: Order to halt refugee admissions into the United States until refugee policy \u201cbetter aligns\u201d with U.S. interest.\n\nThe executive order, \u201cRealigning the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program\u201d suspends the formal U.S. refugee program immediately for the indefinite future, with certain case-by-case discretionary exceptions in the national interest available. The program was similarly suspended in 2017 when the first Trump administration took office. The refugee program has long been a source of lawful entry of labor into the United States.\n\nHistorically, refugees sponsored through U.S. Refugee Admissions Program are vetted by multiple U.S. security agencies and if approved, are granted permission to enter, live, and work in the United States legally.\n\nThe order does require the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to submit a report within 90 days regarding whether resuming the entry of refugees would be in the interests of the United States, with further reports following every 90 days thereafter until it is determined that the resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is in the interests of the United States.\n\nProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship: Order to end birthright citizenship.\n\nOne of the most publicized and controversial executive orders, \u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\u201d ends birthright citizenship for infants born in the United States after February 19, 2025, who do not have at least one parent in possession of Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status and/or U.S. citizenship at the time of birth.\n\nThe constitutionality of this order has already been challenged by civil rights organizations as violating the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that \u201c[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d\n\nIf the order is allowed to take effect on February 19, 2025 (and is not enjoined as part of the ongoing lawsuits), parents present in the United States on valid nonimmigrant visas may be required to secure dependent visas for newborn children. However, there is currently no process or framework in effect for obtaining such a visa for a dependent born in the United States.\n\nSecuring Our Borders: Order to end the CBP One program and parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.\n\nThe executive order, \u201cSecuring Our Borders\u201d implements several new enhanced \u201cborder security\u201d protections. As one example, it orders the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to \u201ccease using the \u2018CBP One\u2019 application as a method of paroling or facilitating entry of otherwise inadmissible aliens into the U.S.\u201d The app had allowed asylum-seekers at a port of entry (i.e., a border crossing) to preschedule appointments for processing while maintaining guaranteed asylum eligibility.\n\nThe order also eliminates a \u201cparole\u201d program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans that was directed at providing grants of parole for long-term U.S. visits. With the goal of facilitating lawful entry for individuals who would not otherwise have the appropriate entry documents but who had a \u201cconfirmed U.S. supporter\u201d4 and where a significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons warranted the government\u2019s favorable exercise of discretion, the parole program served as a source of lawful U.S. labor/workers. Once approved, these individuals were allowed to stay in the country for up to two years, obtain a work permit, and be shielded from deportations. There is no guidance on how individuals admitted pursuant to the parole program and currently present in the United States (who may hold work permits) will be affected or if, potentially, they will be required to depart.\n\nThe executive order also addresses pursuing criminal charges against undocumented migrants; deploying \u201csufficient personnel\u201d to the borders; and establishing a wall and \u201cother barriers\u201d at U.S. borders.\n\nProtecting the American People Against Invasion: Order to achieve total enforcement of all immigration laws against inadmissible and removable foreign nationals present in the United States.\n\nThis order directs the federal government to take all available action to prioritize prosecution of criminal offenses related to unauthorized entry or continued unauthorized presence of foreign nationals in the United States, as well as set enhanced enforcement priorities for undocumented individuals. This includes construction and expansion of more detention facilities; implementing a requirement for undocumented individuals to register their presence; and creation of a federal Homeland Security Task Force in each state to coordinate enforcement priorities.\n\nThe order also calls for the U.S. Department of Homeland to deny \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d (i.e., cities that interfere with federal law enforcement operations to identify undocumented individuals) access to federal funds to the maximum extent allowable under law, in addition to further evaluation of criminal or civil penalties for such jurisdictions.\n\nFurther, the order requires that sanctions be imposed against foreign countries that do not accept or facilitate the return of their nationals from the United States, to include denial of U.S. visas to nationals of those countries.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile these orders do not directly change employees\u2019 nonimmigrant or immigrant visa processing in the short-term, it is important for employers to be aware of changing policies and the impact on visa holder employees. We will continue to monitor any changes in the immigration policy area. Should you have any questions, please contact counsel.",

If one parent is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident at the time of the child\u2019s birth, the order says, their child will not be a citizen.\n\nExperts say that this is in direct violation of the Constitution and that the Supreme Court may not uphold it, but many immigrants are already afraid. Bethany Li, executive director of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, says she sees Trump\u2019s move as an attempt to exclude certain groups based on race.\n\n\u201cThis order doesn\u2019t just target undocumented people,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt targets people that come in through student visas. It targets people who have tourist visas. That order, ultimately, is about who Trump considers American.\u201d\n\nTwenty-two states and several other entities have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration contesting the order, which experts say violates the 14th Amendment, which says, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s order argues that the clause \u201cand subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d disqualifies children of these groups.\n\nExperts say that beyond being unconstitutional, the order has the potential to create some bureaucratic headaches, as certain countries don\u2019t automatically give citizenship to those not born in the country \u2014 even for children born to parents who are citizens \u2014 meaning some kids might be temporarily stateless.\n\n\u201cThere could be a whole generation of stateless children who are not citizens in the United States, but they\u2019re not citizens elsewhere either,\u201d said Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, one of the organizations that is suing the Trump administration over the order.\n\nFor families seeking asylum after being facing political persecution in another country, the situation might be even more complicated.\n\n\u201cWe have asylees from Afghanistan, from China. Our plaintiffs are from Indonesia and they\u2019re asylees,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that they will be able to get travel documents or identity documents from the countries that they\u2019re fleeing for their child.\u201d\n\nLi sees the birthright citizenship order as a distraction, she said, as the 14th Amendment is very clear. She doesn\u2019t believe it will survive in court, but she thinks it could affect how desirable the U.S. looks to would-be immigrants from all over the world.\n\n\u201cThis executive order is aimed at stopping Latino and Asian immigrants from coming into this country and building a life here, which is fundamentally opposed to the values of the United States,\u201d Li said.\n\nIt also has the potential to resurface a climate of violence and scrutiny toward immigrant groups, Kohli said. She referred to the establishment of birthright citizenship in 1898, after a Chinese American, Wong Kim Ark, challenged the Chinese Exclusion Act before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe had lynching of Chinese workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe atmosphere was incredibly racist, and still, our community fought and challenged this order.\u201d\n\nLi and Kohli said they worry that Trump\u2019s first days in office are indicative of what\u2019s to come for immigrants in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis speaks to sort of a larger policy orientation in the Trump administration, which is a real tightening of our immigration system, limiting access to visas,\u201d Kohli said.\n\nLi says both legal and undocumented Asian Americans, growing in number each year, should brace themselves for the next stage.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be so many other fights to be had,\u201d she said.",

For those with savings to spare, \u201cgolden visas\u201d can provide a short-cut for Americans to live and work in countries like Portugal, Thailand, and Panama\u2014and some even provide pathways to second citizenship.\n\nFormally known as residence-by-investment programs, golden visas provide legal residence rights\u2014that is, the right to live, work, study, and receive healthcare\u2014to foreign applicants who make a defined economic contribution to the host country, whether through a real estate purchase, philanthropic donation, or other type of investment.\n\nGolden visas and passports can be controversial, especially those that encourage wealthy expats to buy up local homes. \u201cIn some countries, residents think the schemes are corrupt, in some they are baffled as to who would want to buy their citizenship, and in others like Saint Kitts they can be very defensive about the schemes and recognize their contribution to the economy,\u201d Dr. Kristin Surak, an Assistant Professor in Sociology at LSE who studies golden passports and visas, explained in a blog post.\n\nWhile some countries, such as Spain, are in the process of shutting down their residency by investment programs, there\u2019s been a recent surge in American golden visa applicants, according to Henley & Partners, an investment migration advisory firm.\n\n\u201cThe spike in interest and applications from US nationals for alternative residence and citizenship has continued unabated after a record-breaking year in 2024,\u201d a Henley & Partners spokesperson tells Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, citing a nearly 60% increase in applications since 2023, which itself was an unprecedented year for the firm. And compared to the number of applications from 2019, interest in second residencies and citizenships has skyrocketed over 1000% in just five years, the firm says.\n\nSome of the most popular golden visas among American applicants\u2014including Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Malta\u2014allow holders to travel freely within Europe\u2019s Schengen Area. Other popular countries ranked within the top 10 offer a more affordable cost of living and warmer climes, such as Thailand and Panama.\n\nBelow, see the top 30 golden visa programs as recommended by Henley & Partners, in addition to a breakdown of the 10 golden visas that Americans applied to most in 2024 and how to apply.

It did not announce specific travel restrictions.\n\nKey Points:\n\nThe EO requires that the agencies \u201cre-establish a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, consistent with the uniform baseline that existed on January 19, 2021, that will be used for any alien seeking a visa or immigration benefit of any kind\u201d and vet and screen individuals \u201cto the maximum degree possible.\u201d\n\nOver the next 60 days, the agencies must \u201cdetermine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] for one of its nationals, and to ascertain whether the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat.\u201d\n\nThe EO also requires a report to be submitted to the president \u201cidentifying countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)).\u201d\n\nAs of Jan. 21, the government has not announced specific planned changes or travel restrictions, so there are no public details regarding the possible timing or scope of potential future bans, nor whether any exemptions or waivers will be available.\n\nAdditional Information: The president has the authority to restrict the entry of foreign nationals or classes of foreign nationals into the United States and may impose additional restrictions deemed appropriate. Previous travel restrictions have been announced without prior warning and affected foreign nationals from specific countries, in certain nonimmigrant visa categories and those with connections to certain foreign institutions or organizations. Restrictions have also included heightened scrutiny and enhanced vetting of visa applicants.\n\nU.S. immigration policies may change quickly and without prior notice. Foreign nationals are reminded to speak with their BAL team prior to international travel and to be aware of general travel requirements, including maintaining a valid visa in their passport. Foreign nationals may face delays in obtaining a visa appointment at a U.S. consulate or embassy or receiving their visa and should plan accordingly. They may also face further delays with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) during re-entry into the U.S. after travel.\n\nBAL will continue to provide updates as additional information becomes available.\n\nThis alert has been provided by the BAL U.S. Practice Group.",

African visitors to Rwanda also do not need a visa to enter the country.\n\nThe move to facilitate travel within the continent is also being pushed by the African Union (AU).\n\nUnder the updated system, citizens of most African countries will be allowed to enter Kenya and stay ETA-free for up to two months.\n\nMembers of the East African Community, which include Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi, can however stay for up to six months in line with the bloc's policy.\n\nKenya also says it will introduce an enhanced process \"allowing travellers to receive approval instantly\" and a maximum processing time of 72 hours.\n\nIt is not clear when this will take effect. Several ministries have been tasked to propose guidelines within a week to improve \"travellers experience at all Kenyan airports\", according to the cabinet statement.\n\nBefore the introduction of the ETA, visitors from more than 40 countries including several from Africa, were able to arrive in Kenya, get a stamp in their passport and enter without paying anything.\n\nAll travellers must now apply and pay for an ETA at least three days before their trip to Kenya, unless they are citizens of an exempted country.\n\nThe ETA fee is $30 (\u00a324) and valid for 90 days.\n\nThe policy has faced criticism with some noting that it could make it more difficult for potential visitors to come to the country.\n\nKenya has indicated there was a security element to the introduction of the new system, with the government spokesman telling the BBC last year that it was necessary for vetting travellers.\n\nThe country has been targeted by al-Shabab jihadist militants from neighbouring Somalia in several notorious attacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government said it was also introducing a system that would enhance \"pre-screening, strengthen security, and streamline passenger processing at entry points\".",

            "content": "GenAI is part of many conversations these days. And it\u2019s true the technology has the potential to transform businesses \u2014 improving customer support, risk management and even commerce itself. But as Sam Hamilton, head of AI and Data at Visa, told Karen Webster in the latest installment of the \u201cWhat\u2019s Next in Payments: Memo to GenAI Companies\u201d series, the transformative aspects of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can only be realized with the right inputs fed into the LLM models, at the right time.\n\nVisa sees more than 300 billion transactions move across its network annually, tied to $15 trillion, and as such has the right data to feed into those models to support new innovations in payments and beyond, while fine-tuning its own internal capabilities. Through the past five years alone, the firm has invested $11 billion (and counting) in cutting-edge technology, said Hamilton. In one example, through the use of AI, Visa blocked roughly 85% more suspected fraud last year on Cyber Monday last year compared to 2023.\n\nAt a high level, said Hamilton, \u201cI can\u2019t think of one area that GenAI is not going to transform,\u201d building on the foundation of trust that\u2019s already been built between the customer and Visa. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be dramatic change \u2026 the AI timeline is very fast,\u201d he said. The large language models (LLMs) are \u201cprogressing nicely\u201d according to Hamilton, so much so that the ways in which we interact with computers are changing, evolving toward a state where it may feel not like we\u2019re talking to another human being, not a machine.\n\n\u201cWe were the first network to deploy AI-based technology for risk and fraud management,\u201d said Hamilton, who added that the company has been using artificial intelligence (AI) for more than three decades. At present, Visa\u2019s technology platform provides more than 100 products with AI, the byproduct of $3 billion invested during the decade in which Hamilton has been with the firm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready for AI to be deployed across the company \u2014 and enable capabilities that power the next wave of payment security.\u201d To get there, he said, data is critical, but so is technology \u2014 the hardware and software that power the GPUs and LLMs, developed by the right data scientists and other talent that help steer true innovation.\n\nIn recent months, the company updated its Visa Account Attack Intelligence offering, which generates risk scores for card-not-present transactions, identifying issuer bank identification numbers (BINs) and merchants that are under attack by fraudsters, who leverage AI to automatically test payment fields (in what\u2019s known as account enumeration). Visa itself is attacked constantly \u2014 its APIs are besieged by fraudsters billions of times each month, so the company is proving especially adept at using AI to fight fire with fire.\n\n\u201cYou need AI to do all this,\u201d said Hamilton, who noted, too, that Visa has been working, through its $100 million GenAI fund to support startups and help develop frameworks to speed the development of new products and services.\n\nGenAI is proving especially useful in client support \u2014 moving chat bots toward natural language interactions that converse directly with users, helping the payment network\u2019s clients find the support they need from Visa. The Visa analytics platform, said Hamilton, also is used by corporate clients to find the insights they need about their businesses based on the data on hand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also working hard to protect our ecosystem from risk and will use GenAI\u201d for those purposes, said Hamilton. Key among those efforts is making sure that Visa credentials are secure and that the company\u2019s systems are available at all times.\n\nImproving Commerce\n\nBeyond the \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d uses of GenAI as described above, Visa is also harnessing its potential to change the shopping experience itself, giving rise to ever-more-personalized recommendations as AI agents \u201clearn\u201d about individuals and their preferences. Payments data can help Visa\u2019s merchant partners and consumers deliver that robust experience \u2014 powered by consumer-permissioned information. Data tokens, he said, protect sensitive details about consumers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in control of the data 100% of the time,\u201d said Hamilton of consumers. \u201cWith the Visa credentials, you choose to share them with people when you need them and when you need them \u2014 and with the merchant, you can be comfortable sharing that credential to get the payment done \u2026 we\u2019re seeing that this is very valuable.\u201d\n\nAs he told Webster, \u201cAI is no longer just a tool. It\u2019s a collaborator and a partner in shaping our future at Visa.\u201d\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

Employers should ensure their workforce understands these obligations and provide resources to facilitate compliance.\n\n2. Birthright Citizenship Policy Changes\n\nThe EO titled Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship introduces restrictions on birthright citizenship. Effective February 19, 2025. Key changes include:\n\nEligibility Restrictions : Children born in the U.S. will not automatically receive citizenship if their parents are: Unlawfully present in the U.S. and not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Temporarily in the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas (e.g., B-1/B-2, F-1, H-1B, L-1, TN, O-1, P-1).\n\n: Children born in the U.S. will not automatically receive citizenship if their parents are:\n\nRecommended Actions for Work Visa Holders:\n\nPlan to include children in future green card and immigration petitions.\n\nApply for or renew children\u2019s U.S. passports using expedited processing to avoid delays.\n\nLitigation Note: A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking this EO for the time being. While its future is uncertain, employees should take precautions and secure documentation for their children promptly.\n\n3. Travel Ban and Potential Restrictions\n\nThe EO titled Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats mandates a review of countries with potentially insufficient visa vetting processes. A travel ban could be implemented within 30 to 60 days. The same EO will implement extreme vetting for visa applicants, which would cause delayed visa issuance.\n\nAdvisory for Employees:\n\nNonimmigrant employees and their families are strongly advised to avoid travel during this period.\n\nVisa applicants should plan for additional time when applying for visas at consulates abroad.\n\n4. Increased Worksite Investigations\n\nThe EO titled Securing Our Borders allocates more resources toward enforcement, which could result in:\n\nIncreased USCIS/FDNS site visits.\n\nDepartment of Labor investigation.\n\nI-9 Notices of Inspection.\n\nICE Raids.\n\nDiscrimination investigations by the Department of Justice\u2019s Immigrant and Employee Rights division.\n\nBest Practices for Employers:\n\nConduct at least bi-annual internal audits for I-9 and Department of Labor compliance.\n\nEnsure document retention policies and purging cadences meet legal requirements.\n\nTrain Front Desk and HR personnel and managers to handle unannounced investigations appropriately.\n\nConclusion: Staying Informed and Prepared\n\nThe changes introduced by these Executive Orders demand immediate attention from both employers and employees. By staying proactive, conducting regular compliance audits, and providing resources to your sponsored foreign nationals, you can mitigate risks and ensure adherence to evolving immigration policies.

In recent years, demand for the H-2B visas available for Oct. 1 or later start dates has also increased.\n\nThat has led to some significant updates related to the H-2 B program at the end of 2024 and to start the new year.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nCompanies using the H-1B visa program to hire skilled workers from abroad should prepare for an application process that takes longer and costs more, along with site visits and heavier regulation of the program, according to an attorney specializing in employer-based immigration.\n\nHaving campaigned on an immigration-heavy platform, pledging significant changes, president-elect Donald Trump has discussed deporting millions of undocumented people.\n\nHowever, legal immigration is also expected to be affected and many employers are bracing for potential disruptions in the H-1B program, which offers 85,000 visas annually to highly educated workers with specialized skills.\n\nMost of the employees are from India and China, many of them engineers hired by large technology companies after they complete their university studies in the U.S. The H-1B visa is for three years but can be renewed.\n\nA Biden administration modernization of the H-1B rules, designed to increase the program\u2019s efficiency, took effect Jan. 17. The changes were designed to make the 35-year-old worker program more flexible for employers, and harder to change dramatically by administration. Biden\u2019s modernization also gave the executive branch more oversight tools to monitor H-1B compliance.\n\n\u201cThe modernization rule was largely put in place to codify a lot of the areas that the first Trump administration had targeted and tried to use executive orders to change,\u201d Ann Lee, a Holland & Hart partner specializing in employment immigration, told Legal Dive.\n\n\u201cSo if the Trump administration wanted to change it back, it would be a big hurdle. Does it mean it\u2019s not possible when they put their mind to it? No. But it may also mean they just kind of work within the confines of what they already have.\u201d\n\nThe H-1B visa program has become a topic of fierce conflict within Trump\u2019s Republican party before the incoming administration takes office.\n\nLast month, two of Trump\u2019s wealthy supporters, billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, posted their support of expanding the program, with Trump appearing to side with their view. \u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program,\u201d Trump told the New York Post Dec. 28, when asked about the intra-party conflict.\n\nMusk\u2019s companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have both hired large numbers of engineers using the visa program. Musk has said the U.S. does not produce enough natively born, qualified engineers with the work ethic his businesses need.\n\nTrump\u2019s first administration sought to reduce the number of H-1B visas. Denials of new H-1B petitions for initial employment rose from 6% in fiscal year 2015 to 24% in 2018, according to data recently compiled by the American Immigration Council. The denial rate declined later in Trump\u2019s first term as companies contested the government\u2019s rulings.\n\n\u201cI think it will be interesting to see how much weight Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may end up having, because the first Trump administration heavily targeted H-1Bs,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIs it possible he doesn\u2019t target (H-1B visas) as much, especially because of Musk and Ramaswamy? Yes. But is anyone sitting comfortably here? No. I think time has shown that the Trump administration may not always have been consistent and followed through, if they preferred something or not.\u201d\n\nHow to prepare\n\nWhile the focus in many industries has been I-9 compliance \u2014 and enforcement against undocumented workers\u2014 companies that rely on H-1B employees should focus on \u201cpublic access files,\u201d or the physical and electronic notices regulators require them to post information about the role being filled via a foreign-born person, Lee said.\n\nFor many companies, \u201cit\u2019s easy to not be in compliance with their public access files,\u201d she said. \u201cHow often is someone looking at them?\u201d\n\nAnother issue to consider, Lee said, is whether any employees working on H-1B visas have relocated in recent years, perhaps as part of a remote-working opportunity in a more affordable locale. The visa is granted for a specific location, for example, California or New York City. If the employee has moved to another state, that presents grounds for potentially revoking the visa.\n\nCompanies that need H-1B employees must evaluate their needs and budgets and prepare for processing delays, Lee said. Some companies are forming task forces to identify key \u201cstakeholders\u201d who need to be involved in the worker-sponsorship process, and allocating costs for the process to specific budgets, she said.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is likely to increase their requests for evidence for a range of worker-visa programs and \u201cthat\u2019s going to lead to more legal fees and time delays,\u201d Lee said. These task forces also should consider potential travel restrictions and how that could affect their H-1B workers.\n\nFor in-house legal departments and human resources professionals, \u201cmake sure there are people ready to target these questions and address them at a higher level,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think with a lot of companies immigration usually falls under HR rather than the legal department so it\u2019s probably good to make sure there is more of a connection between HR and talent acquisition and the legal team.\u201d",

(Getty Images) 1\n\n2\n\nA Tale of Two Trumps: From Ban to Praise\n\nTech Titans Back Trump\u2019s Pivot\n\nMAGA Meltdown: Far-Right Outrage\n\nThe H-1B Conundrum: Reform or Replace?\n\nTrump\u2019s Immigration Tightrope\n\nThe H-1B visa program, long a flashpoint in American immigration debates, has returned to the spotlight as Donald Trump reverses his stance on the controversial policy. Once a staunch critic who lambasted the program as \"very, very bad\" for American workers, Trump now calls it \"a great program,\" hailing its role in fostering innovation and bolstering US businesses. This sharp U-turn has sparked a fiery debate within Trump\u2019s political base and beyond, exposing deep divisions in the conservative camp. As Trump takes the oath today as the 47th President of the United States, let's take a look at how his stance on skilled immigration has changed with time.In 2016, Trump\u2019s hardline rhetoric against H-1B visas resonated with working-class Americans worried about job displacement. His temporary ban on new H-1B visas during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 was a symbolic move to protect domestic jobs. Fast forward to today, and Trump\u2019s newfound admiration for the program has left his MAGA loyalists stunned. \u201cI\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B,\u201d Trump recently declared, aligning himself with tech industry leaders who see the visas as vital for maintaining America\u2019s global competitiveness. This shift marks a stark departure from his earlier position and raises questions about his priorities in a potential second term.Trump\u2019s reversal has drawn applause from Silicon Valley heavyweights like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, both vocal advocates for skilled immigration. Musk, a former H-1B holder turned US citizen, credits the program for fostering the innovation that drives America\u2019s tech dominance. Ramaswamy, while supporting reforms to curb abuse, agrees that the program is essential to attract top global talent. Their endorsement underscores the growing alliance between Trump and tech elites, a partnership that could redefine the GOP\u2019s stance on immigration.Not everyone in Trump\u2019s camp is on board. Steve Bannon and other far-right figures have blasted the H-1B program as a corporate scheme to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Bannon\u2019s scathing criticism highlights the ideological rift within the MAGA movement, with populist hardliners viewing Trump\u2019s shift as a betrayal of his 2016 promises. This divide reflects a broader struggle within the Republican Party as it grapples with balancing economic pragmatism and nationalist ideals.The H-1B program\u2019s flaws are well-documented. Critics from both the left and right argue that the lottery system is ripe for abuse, with some companies using it to undercut wages or outsource jobs. Democratic voices like Bernie Sanders and Ro Khanna have called for stricter eligibility criteria, ensuring the visas prioritize exceptional talent rather than corporate profit. Meanwhile, experts warn that failing to reform the system risks undermining its legitimacy and effectiveness.As Trump navigates the treacherous waters of immigration policy, his stance on H-1B visas could become a defining issue of his second term. With tech giants urging expansion and MAGA purists demanding restriction, Trump faces a high-stakes balancing act. The outcome will not only shape America\u2019s economic future but also test the durability of Trump\u2019s political coalition.In true Trump fashion, his pivot on H-1B visas has reignited a contentious debate that pits innovation against nationalism. Whether this move cements his legacy as a pragmatist or alienates his base remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the stakes have never been higher.",

It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her visa and employment history.\n\nI graduated from San Jose State University with a bachelor's in science in December 2023. I was born and raised in Singapore but hold Indian citizenship, and I moved to the US for college in 2019.\n\nAfter graduation, I landed a job as a lab technologist at The Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research organization. As an international student who only had 90 days to find work, I applied to hundreds of jobs and felt extremely lucky to land this role.\n\nIt meant moving from California to a remote town in Maine where I didn't know anyone, but I was grateful. My parents had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars so I could study in the US, and part of me felt embarrassed if I could not find a job here after graduation. It would also make me question if my degree was worth it.\n\nMissing out on family\n\nLast year, I started planning a trip to India in January to meet my parents, who had recently moved there from Singapore, and my extended family.\n\nAs a Science-Technology-Engineering-Math graduate, I am allowed a two-year extension on my Optional Practical Training visa, which is seen as a pathway to securing an H-1B \u2014 a visa for highly skilled foreign workers.\n\nRecent debates in the US about stricter immigration rules spooked me and the company's legal team. Late last year, I was advised to apply for my two-year extension as soon as possible. My legal advisor was worried that President-elect Donald Trump's administration might suspend the OPT pathway, as they threatened to do in 2020.\n\nI was stressed, and earlier this month, I paid almost $1,700 for a fast-tracked version of the application. My application was approved last week, days before Trump's inauguration.\n\nI also canceled all my international travel plans until the summer.\n\nIt was heartbreaking \u2014 I have been desperate to visit India because there are family members there, including my aging grandparents, who I have not met in six years.\n\nConstant uncertainty\n\nI've spent every Thursday for the past five to six weeks meeting the legal team at my company.\n\nThe uncertainty of being on a visa has also affected my attitude at work, especially with the constant threat of layoffs. I don't speak up strongly even when we're asked for opinions because I don't want to upset anyone. I've become quieter and more compliant.\n\nOutside of work, I'm worried about the smallest mistakes, like getting a parking ticket. I'm anxious that it'll go on my permanent record and hold me back down the line.\n\nI never imagined facing any of these challenges when I first applied to universities in the US. Before university, I had only been exposed to Asia, and I was excited to live in a Western country and see the American Dream for myself.\n\nLooking back, I'm not sure if moving here was worth it. Every week, I question whether I should be here, if I should change my job, and if I even want to apply for an H-1B and eventually pursue citizenship.\n\nMy dad has spent his adult life in Singapore, one of the world's most developed countries. He still talks to me as if I'm in the best place on the planet. I think there has been a huge shift in sentiment towards migration since his generation, which moved out of India in the early 2000s for better career opportunities.\n\nI've come to realize that I crave stability and family more than anything. If I can find a job in India, where I'm a citizen, I would not mind relocating even though I've never lived there. I'd be relieved knowing that nobody can deport me, I can move jobs, and I can be close to family.\n\nEditors note: The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider for this story.",

This idyllic island outpost is a highlight of the Caribbean \u2013 a dramatic landscape of cacti, volcanic rock and divi-divi trees that beckons to be explored.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Aruba is a bucket-list destination for travelers. The island is a playground for water sports such as kite surfing and scuba diving, and terrestrial adventures such as hiking and horseback riding. Its hub city, Oranjestad, has strong Spanish, Dutch and Indigenous influences, best discovered in its many restaurants, pubs and museums.\n\nBut how easy is it to enter the country? That depends on your passport. Here's everything you need to know about visas for Aruba.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAruba is a riot of color during the annual carnival \u00a9 Jan-Otto / Getty Images\n\nWho can travel to Aruba without a visa?\n\nTravelers from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland and the 29 members of the Schengen Area (which includes most countries in the European Union) do not need a visa to enter Aruba for a stay of up to 90 days.\n\nThat number is extended to 180 days for those in Schengen countries and US nationals.\n\nIn addition, nationals from Central and South America, Asia, and Caribbean nations may be exempt. View the full list of countries able to visit without a visa here.\n\nSpecial categories for visa-free travel\n\nThe following countries\u2019 nationals may enter without a visa with conditions:\n\nHong Kong \u2013 holders of British National Overseas or Special Administrative Region passports\n\nMacao \u2013 holders of Special Administrative Region passport\n\nTaiwan \u2013 holders of a passport bearing their identity card number\n\nUkraine \u2013 holders of a biometric passport\n\nSome holders of specialized passports are also allowed to enter Aruba without a visa. Diplomatic passport holders from Bolivia, Georgia, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malawi, Morocco, Pakistan, Senegal, South Africa, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey and Ukraine do not need a visa.\n\nThose with a refugee or stateless persons\u2019 travel document issued by the Kingdom of the Netherlands or the US and holders of an alien\u2019s travel document issued by the US or Canada are also welcome without a visa.\n\nHolders of laissez-passer documents issued by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, the United Nations or any of its agencies are exempt too, as are crew members of vessels or aircraft mooring or landing on the island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAruba also has the One Happy Workation program for digital nomads from the US (run in partnership with local resorts and hotels) which allows a 90-day stay. However, this does not allow you to work for any companies based in Aruba.\n\nTransit travelers\n\nTravelers spending 24 hours or less on the island can enter Aruba without a visa, regardless of their country of origin. This includes cruise ship passengers disembarking on the island as part of their voyage, as well as airline passengers transmitting to another country (or a neighboring Caribbean island) within 24 hours (48 hours for those from Bonaire, Cura\u00e7ao, Saba and St. Eustatius). However, airline passengers may not leave the international transit zone.\n\nAir and sea crew members can stay without a visa for up to 48 hours.\n\nWho needs a visa for Aruba?\n\nWhile Aruba\u2019s generous visa exemption scheme means that many travelers can visit the island without a visa, travelers who do need a visa are in for some extra legwork.\n\nAruba is part of the Caribbean short-stay visa scheme, which allows entry to numerous islands in the region for up to 90 days. These multi-island, multi-entry visas are a convenient solution for those island-hopping around the southern Caribbean.\n\nTo obtain a Caribbean visa, visitors to Aruba must apply in person at either an Aruban embassy or an embassy or consulate of the Netherlands. The Kingdom of the Netherlands operates a convenient online portal with full details of the rules and regulations.\n\nThe list of nationalities who require a visa for Aruba is extensive and includes any nationals of countries not listed above.\n\nTravel documents required for Aruba\n\nIn addition to visas, entry requirements for Aruba specify that you must have a valid passport for the duration of your stay and complete the mandatory Embarkation and Disembarkation (ED) card online before arrival.\n\nAdditionally, you need to show a return or onward ticket and provide proof of accommodation, whether through a hotel reservation, property ownership or invitation from a resident.\n\nYou may also be asked to demonstrate sufficient funds to cover expenses during your stay. While not mandatory, travel insurance with medical coverage is recommended.\n\nChildren younger than 12 do not need a visa if they are traveling with a parent or guardian. When you leave Aruba, the island offers customs preclearance for US travelers, which means that passengers returning to the US can clear customs on the island, skipping the long lines at mainland airports.\n\nThe rock pool in Arikok National Park is one of Aruba's most striking natural features \u00a9 by Marc Guitard / Getty Images\n\nHow to extend your stay in Aruba\n\nTourists who want to extend the initial 90\u2013 or 180\u2013day stay can apply for a long-stay visa but often need a residence permit. This permit is also necessary for individuals planning to live, work or retire in Aruba.\n\nThere are three types of residence permits:\n\nTemporary permits are suitable if you intend to stay for a specific period while working. Holders are prohibited from seeking employment unless explicitly authorized.\n\nPermanent permits are designed for those wanting to make Aruba their long-term home. You must demonstrate financial self-sufficiency, provide a history of residence and employment over the past 10 years and present a police clearance certificate.\n\nWork and residence permits are required if you wish to work in Aruba. Prospective employers must obtain a positive recommendation from the Department of Labor and a work permit from the Department of Immigration and Naturalization Services before they can start working.\n\nA residence permit requires a sponsor, such as an employer or a partner and can be obtained at the Department of Integration and Management of Foreign Nationals in Oranjestad. If you intend to stay for work, you need to complete an application for a work permit through the same department.\n\nAruba's vaccination requirements\n\nTravelers from areas where yellow fever is endemic, including most of Central America, Latin America and Africa, will need to show a yellow fever vaccination certificate on arrival. This includes passengers who traveled to those areas and spent over 12 hours.\n\nThe best time to visit Aruba\n\nRenowned for its nearly 365 days of sunshine, Aruba is a year-round paradise. Still, the best time to visit Aruba is during the dry season, from mid\u2013December to mid\u2013April. It\u2019s also Aruba\u2019s high season, so the island comes alive with events and activities, although accommodation prices are typically higher.\n\nConsider the shoulder months of May and November for a more budget-friendly experience with fewer crowds. These months often deliver excellent weather with warm temperatures and lower prices while avoiding the limited rainy season in late fall.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nBest things to do in Aruba from skydiving to off-roading\n\nWhen is the best time to go to Aruba\n\nThe top 7 beaches in Aruba",

            "content": "Policy on taxes and worker visas are top of mind for many hoteliers as they anticipate what the second Trump administration might accomplish.\n\nSelect a question above or ask something else\n\nThe article discusses how the hotel industry is keenly observing potential policy changes under the Trump administration, particularly concerning tax cuts and worker visas. The industry is focused on the extension of key tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly benefit hotel chains like Marriott and Hilton. Additionally, the sector supports reforms to immigration policies to allow more temporary workers through H-2B visas, crucial for seasonal employment, while also monitoring broader economic policies that could affect hotel operations and travel patterns.\n\nTrump\u2019s Impact on Travel Read how the first 100 days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s actions and policies are shaping the future of travel, and get insights into the industry's evolving response. Read how the first 100 days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s actions and policies are shaping the future of travel, and get insights into the industry's evolving response. Read the Stories\n\nWhile no hotel-specific policy stands out on the Trump administration's agenda, some broader policy decisions on taxes and worker visas may especially impact hotels.\n\nThe hotel sector is particularly focused on the fate of key business tax provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Trump campaigned on extending provisions that are set to expire by year-end.\n\nSignificant money is at stake. In 2019, Marriott estimated its related tax benefit from the law was $194 million. Hilton calculated that the law had generated a $610 million benefit.\n\nAt the time, CEO Christopher Nassetta said that the tax cuts would also help Hilton increase hotel occupancy because many companies would use some of their tax savings to travel more.\n\n\"Overall, we think [the changes in tax policy] will be good for the broader economy, lodging industry, and Hilton,\" Nassetta said in 2018.\n\nTwo representatives of the hotel industry told Skift this month that businesses could face a 33% tax increase if the provisions expire.\n\n\"When you're a business owner running a hotel, what you really want is certainty about your costs to be able to make smart decisions about continuing to expand your business,\" said one industry representative who asked that their name not be used. \"Extending the 2017 tax provisions would lead to many years of significant tax certainty.\"\n\nSome data suggests the law helped hotels invest in their properties. Total capital expenditures within the hotel and lodging industry rose from $12.4 billion in 2017 to $18.9 billion in 2020, according to a study by the International Society of Hospitality Consultants.\n\nThree Key Tax Policies\n\nThe sources Skift spoke to pointed to three tax measures they hope the Trump administration and Congress extend.\n\nThe small business deduction: One aspiration is to make permanent a 20% deduction for small businesses on income from ordinary business operations. Over half of America's nearly 64,000 hotels are small businesses, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association.\n\nBonus depreciation: Another goal is to extend the 100% write-off for commercial assets in the year they're acquired. The incentive began phasing out in 2023 and will completely expire by 2027. For hotels, the most salient issue is managing renovation costs. If hotel owners can't write off expansion costs immediately, they may find it more difficult to afford property enhancements.\n\nLike-kind exchange preservation: A century-old provision of the tax code allows real-estate owners to defer capital gains taxes if the proceeds from selling one property are rolled into buying another. If this provision isn't saved, hotel owners could struggle to sell and reinvest in new properties without incurring significant tax liabilities.\n\n\"There are provisions that are going to sunset in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that, as business owners, affect all of us,\" said Lisa Lombardo, president of ARK Holdings Group, which provides third-party management for hotel owners, at the Lodging Conference in October.\n\nExtending the tax cuts would likely also benefit investors in publicly held hotel groups and real estate investment trusts. As Hilton's Nassetta told CNBC at the time of the bill's passage: \"It's not really going to change the way we allocate capital. Tax reform, in reducing our tax rates, is going to drive more free cash flow, and the largest part of that free cash flow increase is going to go back to our shareholders.\"\n\nWorker Visas\n\nTightening immigration policy was a hallmark of Trump's campaign. Some hotel industry leaders prefer reform frameworks that allow more temporary workers under H-2B temporary visas while still reducing illegal immigration. H-2B visas are granted for a limited time \u2013 for seasonal work, for example, according to the Department of Labor.\n\nThe hotel industry has long coveted seasonal workers, especially for remote resort locations without local populations to provide help. The owners of the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, for example, have testified before Congress about the importance of having access to temporary foreign workers.\n\nTwo longtime travel sector lobbyists believed there was broad hotel sector support to ask Congress not to count returning temporary workers against the cap on the number of visas issued yearly. These industry representatives argued that workers who have previously complied with visa requirements and tax obligations represent ideal candidates for the hospitality sector.\n\nThe lobbyists said more specialized H-1B visas, which are mainly for management roles requiring bachelor's degrees, are valuable for specialized culinary positions, event planning management, and information technology needs.\n\n\n\nA debate over H-1B visas erupted last month among Trump supporters, including Elon Musk and Steve Bannon, though it focused on using the program for tech workers.\n\nThe Trump administration is planning to carry out widespread deportations in Chicago as soon as Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal first reported, citing four people familiar with the plan. The plan is to target those in the U.S. illegally with criminal backgrounds. Similar actions in other big cities could follow, the Journal said.\n\nImplications of Broader Policies\n\nIndustry observers are also monitoring the potential indirect effects of Trump's broader economic policies. One executive at a large hotel asset management firm noted that any changes to tariff policies could impact development and renovation costs. A longtime hotel sector lobbyist said that energy policy decisions affecting fuel prices could influence travel patterns.\n\nGovernments Will Become a Bigger Part of Your Travel Plans As cities around the world deal with a major influx of tourists, get ready to see more short-term rental restrictions, tourist taxes, and reservation systems for some of the most popular destinations.

This update outlines key requirements and recommendations to ensure alignment with Vietnam\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nKey compliance expectations.\n\nHost-sponsored DN Visas vs. self-sponsored e-visas.\n\nBusiness travelers engaging with a host entity in Vietnam are expected to enter on a DN visa sponsored by the host organization. This ensures proper monitoring and compliance with local requirements, such as temporary stay registrations with local police.\n\nMandatory temporary stay registration.\n\nAlthough landlords are responsible for temporary registrations, companies must ensure compliance for their foreign business travelers. Host-sponsored DN visas simplify this process by formalizing the relationship between the visitor and the host entity.\n\nTransparent trip declarations.\n\nFor self-sponsored e-visas, the purpose of entry must be clearly declared as business. Ambiguities or misaligned declarations (e.g., work or tourism) can lead to compliance issues during inspections.\n\nPotential risks with e-visas.\n\nAuthorities have raised concerns over the use of self-sponsored e-visas, particularly when applied repeatedly by the same individual. Frequent applications can raise red flags and may result in visa denials. Inspections have highlighted cases where the use of e-visas has conflicted with compliance requirements, prompting stricter oversight.\n\nRecommendations for companies operating in Vietnam.\n\nTo mitigate risks and remain compliant, companies operating in Vietnam should:\n\nUse DN visas: Prioritize host-sponsored DN visas for foreign business travelers, even for short-term engagements. This approach ensures compliance and simplifies oversight.\n\nAvoid over-reliance on e-visas: Limit the use of self-sponsored e-visas and avoid repetitive applications for the same individual.\n\nBe proactive with registrations: Ensure temporary stay registrations are completed for all foreign visitors. Non-compliance can attract penalties during inspections.\n\nMonitor regulatory changes: Vietnam\u2019s visa policies are subject to change, and companies should regularly review updates to ensure continued compliance.\n\nVietnam\u2019s reinforced immigration policies underline the importance of proactive visa management. Adopting the recommended practices will help companies ensure compliance, avoid disruptions, and maintain smooth business operations in Vietnam.\n\nFor tailored advice or assistance with Vietnam\u2019s visa and immigration requirements, contact Newland Chase today.",

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will announce the registration dates in the coming weeks. One significant change is that H-1B pre-registration process fee will be $215.00 (up from $10.00 in 2024).\n\nThe H-1B Cap Season: March 2025\n\nThe H-1B nonimmigrant visa is one of the most highly utilized and sought-after temporary work visas. It facilitates the employment of foreign nationals entering the United States to perform employment in \u201cspecialty occupations,\u201d which are occupations requiring at least a bachelor\u2019s degree or equivalent to perform temporary duties in the United States. Please note that petitioners may submit only one (1) H-1B registration per H-1B applicant.\n\nThe H-1B visa is limited to 85,000 visa petition submissions per cap season and employment start dates occur on October 1 of each government fiscal year. H-1B visa petition submissions to USCIS may be filed up to 180 days in advance of the commencement of employment. April 1, 2025, is expected to be the first day of the year that H-1B filings for selected registrations are accepted by USCIS.\n\nConsiderations and Deadlines\n\nFor those cases selected in the H-1B lottery, employers must adhere to the filing period which is expected to run from April 1-June 30. While in most cases a cap petition may be filed at any time during that time frame, some cases must be filed at specific times and are time sensitive. Special consideration should be given to F-1 students holding optional practical training status who will need \u2018H-1B cap -gap\u2019 protection to continue employment during the summer months. Additionally, consideration would be given to those graduating in the spring of 2025 who, meeting all requirements of the degree, file H-1B petitions after conferral of the formal degree.\n\nStudents with valid optional practical training endorsement and valid employment authorization cards with validity expiring after April 1, 2025, and who are selected in the H-1B random lottery may remain in the United States, continue their employment pursuant to the special H-1B \u2018cap-gap\u2019 rules, and will have their status changed to H-1B effective October 1, 2025.\n\nFor those foreign nationals not selected in the H-1B cap lottery, consideration to other visa category eligibility should be carefully reviewed and considered. Other nonimmigrant visa options, including the O1 visa for extraordinary workers, the E visa for executive, managerial and essential skilled workers from qualifying countries and more, remain backups available for consideration if one may not be selected in the H-1B lottery or not qualify in the first instance.\n\n[View source.]",

            "content": "The United States is a great place to be talented, but a poor place to develop your talents. The combination of tax and regulatory policies, access to capital, freedom of movement and expression, and concentration of other exceptional people allows the best and brightest to thrive economically and culturally. But for most American students, getting there is tricky, due to the bias against advanced education in our K-12 schools and teacher prep programs.\n\nThis dichotomy is what makes recent visa debates so vexing: For every H-1B visa holder who thrives in and contributes to our country\u2019s economy and culture, we can point to many more students already in the U.S. who have few opportunities to develop their strengths into true excellence. We need both highly skilled immigrants and highly talented Americans, because the American economy has an almost infinite need for exceptional workers to compete in the global marketplace.\n\nWe have decades of research showing that students thrive when they have access to advanced education, be it in the form of accelerated coursework, AP courses, specialized math-science high schools, or other rigorous, high-quality interventions. However, the trend over the past decade in public schools has been to reduce advanced services, usually due to the mistaken belief that providing those services is \u201cinequitable.\u201d\n\nBut by increasing H-1B visa fees, we can leverage the immigration system to create more opportunities for American students to perform at advanced levels. The new revenue could support an initiative to promote American educational excellence, the first since the National Defense Education Act was passed in reaction to Sputnik. Raising the current fees by $2,000 at current visa numbers would produce over $160 million annually to promote academic excellence, or roughly $30 per K-12 student \u2013 a very small investment in American excellence but an exponential increase from the current 30 cents per student.\n\nLeading policymakers, including Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA), supported this idea during previous attempts to overhaul the immigration system. But using an increase in H-1B visa fees to develop homegrown talent is again timely due to the recent explosion in research and policy development on advanced education. We have learned a great deal about developing students\u2019 exceptional talents both effectively and efficiently, yet this knowledge is not being used in most schools and classrooms due to a widespread bias against gifted and advanced education. Federal leadership is needed to push through this misguided resistance.\n\nThis additional revenue could be used to encourage academic excellence in many ways: expanding the existing Javits Program, which funds advanced learning pilot projects; offering demonstration grants for districts to implement research-based strategies; encouraging federally-funded labs to offer or expand internships for promising high school and college students; funding summer and weekend STEM programs; creating planning grants to help states create residential STEM academies; establishing public-private partnerships for teachers to help them understand what future workplaces will expect from their students; designing opportunities for private sector STEM experts to teach and mentor K-12 students; even offering NDEA-style graduate fellowships in key fields to get our brightest students the education they need to excel at world-class levels.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThese and many other ideas have been proposed, but a lack of urgency and funding at the federal level has prevented wide-scale adoption. The sense of urgency is increasing due to economic and security concerns, and an H-1B fee increase could help address the funding concerns.\n\nSo give out the golden visa tickets, but do so with the knowledge that industry\u2019s and immigrants\u2019 short-term gains will also directly benefit American students. The private sector and universities get their highly talented workers at a reasonable visa cost, the country gets its first serious, national attempt at advanced education in nearly 70 years, and America\u2019s most promising students get more opportunities to shine. Our country attracts the highly talented like a magnet. Why not leverage that reality to help more American students develop their exceptional talents?\n\nJonathan Plucker is a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Education, where he directs the master\u2019s program in education policy.",

No Yes\n\nSanders' amendment proposes these changes:\n\nIncreased H-1B Fees:\n\nHigher Prevailing Wages:\n\nProtection for American Workers:\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to the Laken Riley Act aimed at reforming the H-1B visa program, arguing it primarily serves to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign guest workers. He contends these workers are often exploited, akin to indentured servants. \u201cThe main function of the H-1B programme is not to hire 'the best and the brightest' but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with hundreds of thousands of lower-paid guest workers from abroad who are often treated as indentured servants.The cheaper it is to hire guest workers, the more money the multi-billionaire owners of large corporations make,\u201d Sanders, 83, said on the Senate floor earlier this week.Sanders directly challenged Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's support of the H-1B program, questioning why Tesla laid off thousands of American workers while simultaneously seeking to hire H-1B visa holders. He cited examples of Tesla hiring H-1B workers for significantly lower salaries than typical for similar positions in the US. He argued that the program is being used to drastically reduce labor costs for corporations, rather than filling genuine skill gaps.\u201cThey are two sides of the same coin. If there is truly a major shortage of skilled tech workers in this country, as Musk has argued, why did Tesla lay off over 7,500 American workers last year \u2013 including many software developers and engineers at its factory in Austin, Texas \u2013 while applying to hire thousands of H-1B guest workers?\u201d he asked.Corporations engaged in mass layoffs should not be allowed to replace American workers with guest workers. \u201cFinally, this amendment would prevent corporations from treating H-1B guest workers as indentured servants. Under current law, H-1B guest workers are often locked into lower-paying jobs and can have their visas taken away from them by their corporate bosses if they complain about dangerous, unfair or illegal working conditions,\u201d he noted.\u201cThat is unacceptable and has got to change. This amendment would make H-1B visas portable and enable guest workers to easily change jobs,\u201d Sanders said.Doubling the fees corporations pay to hire H-1B workers, generating an estimated $370 million annually for scholarships for American students in STEM fields.Requiring corporations to pay H-1B workers at least the median local wage for their position, preventing wage undercutting of American workers.Prohibiting companies from replacing laid-off American workers with H-1B visa holders.Worker Protections: Making H-1B visas portable, allowing guest workers to change jobs and escape potentially exploitative working conditions.Sanders criticized claims of a tech worker shortage, citing data showing numerous American STEM graduates are unemployed. He pointed out that many top H-1B employers are outsourcing companies (\"body shops\") that facilitate both domestic and international job outsourcing. He highlighted examples of H-1B workers being paid significantly less than American workers in comparable roles, such as software developers in Dallas and accountants in Houston.",

There are visas, bank accounts, housing, and many other logistics to figure out. That\u2019s where people like Jen Barnett come in. A few years ago, Barnett and her husband moved to M\u00e9rida, a city in the Mexican state of Yucat\u00e1n. After taking the leap themselves, they founded the company Expatsi to help people wrap their heads around where and how they could live abroad. Since the election, 50,000 new people have signed up for their newsletter.\n\nOne destination that many consider is Portugal. Due to the country\u2019s friendly visa programs, there are about 10,000 Americans living there.\n\nOn a recent episode of Slate\u2019s podcast How To!, host Carvell Wallace talked to Barnett about Portugal and other foreign visa options, the implications for taxes and international travel, and how expat-curious listeners can take the first step. This transcript has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nCarvell Wallace: Tell us a bit about what your life in the Yucat\u00e1n is like.\n\nJen Barnett: When we first got here, it was 2022, the tail end of the pandemic. One of the big things that stressed us at home was all the drama over masking and social distancing. And we came down here, and 100 percent of people had their masks on. What I saw was that everyone was in it together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe did come down here without a lick of Spanish, and we take classes. We go to in-person school, and we\u2019re learning. But people are really patient with us while we learn, and we\u2019ve made a lot of friends.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to move to Mexico, and we can still visit Spain, Portugal, Vietnam, Uruguay, and anywhere else we want to go. But we can do it at half the cost of living and without this constant pressure of living in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about moving to another country, you should be thinking not only about which countries you want to move to, but also which countries want you to move there. Which inevitably brings us to the subject of visas. What kinds of visas are available for Americans looking to move abroad?\n\nTo get a retirement visa in Portugal\u2014called the D7\u2014you only need about $900 a month in passive income, and you actually can still work on it. So if you were able to work from anywhere at your job, but you were able to show $900 a month in investment returns or things like that, then you could move on the D7.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlternatively, you could go as a digital nomad. That visa is called the D8, and you need to show about $3,000 a month in income.\n\nSpain also has a digital nomad visa. You do have to be a 1099 worker to get it. You can also be self-employed.\n\nWhat other countries should people consider?\n\nAnother option is the Netherlands. They have a visa there called the DAFT, or Dutch American Friendship Treaty, and it\u2019s a visa that they released just for Americans as a thank you after World War II. It is only for self-employed Americans. But all you have to do is deposit 4,500 euros in a local bank account and be self-employed. You do have to have a lease, which is true, of course, in Portugal, too, before you get your visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nice thing about Spain and the Netherlands is that you can move first for a digital nomad or self-employment visa or a DAFT visa, and then apply from within the country, which you cannot do in Portugal.\n\nI would consider Mexico. One thing I like about Mexico is that as Americans, you can spend six months there without a visa at all. So you can always go there and continue to visit Portugal or Spain or the Netherlands. Or if you\u2019re waiting for a visa to be approved, it\u2019s a great place to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut keep in mind that when you\u2019re on your scouting trip, you can travel as much as you want in and around Europe for up to 90 days out of any 180 days. Then you have to leave the Schengen zone for three months. We have a lot of clients who are traveling around as they decide where they want to land. And so they\u2019ll do three months in a Schengen country and then spend three months in Albania, which is not in the Schengen zone. Americans can go to Albania for a year with no visa at all. So that\u2019s another popular option for people who want to leave quickly, especially when they\u2019re on limited funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you moved to Portugal, does the question of EU citizenship come on the table?\n\nOne thing about getting citizenship in the EU is that you can then move anywhere in the EU. There are a lot of Americans who have Irish or Italian or Hungarian heritage. And with those countries in particular, you can get citizenship by going back two or three generations and showing that you had an Irish great-grandmother, and potentially get citizenship. But then people may not want to live in Ireland or Italy, so they take that citizenship, and then they move to the country in the EU that they prefer. You can apply for citizenship after five years of residency in Portugal, and there is a language test.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter what category you fall into, you should be thinking about taxes, right?\n\nI am not a tax professional by any means, but it is important to note that you will always file in the U.S. unless you renounce citizenship. So you will file in both countries, but most often you don\u2019t get double taxed. So if Portugal decides that you need to have paid 30 percent on your income, and you paid the U.S. 24 percent, then they might charge you 6 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in Portugal, you do qualify for public [health] care after three months, which is incredible. The public care there is excellent. You have to have private insurance for those first three months before that time, and most Americans tend to maintain private health insurance because it helps them not have to wait in any lines or things like that. I also think it\u2019s great to have private health insurance because it helps subsidize the public system for locals, which I think is another way to contribute to the community.\n\nAn influx of Americans can change the local economy, and not for the better, for locals, particularly if you move to a place where the currency is weaker. It\u2019s kind of a gentrification effect. How do you think about that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat we found is that expats lift up the economy everywhere they go, and governments have the ability to release the right kind of visas. So countries that need money, they release spaces that are for digital nomads, retirees, and investors.\n\nBut in general, when you look at a retiree or digital nomad, you\u2019re talking about someone who is bringing their whole life savings, spending it in your country, and not taking a job or voting. It\u2019s literally the opposite of colonization. Now, that said, anti-immigrant sentiments, they\u2019re going to be everywhere on some level. For populist politicians, it\u2019s a very popular thing to be anti-immigrant. Sometimes if it\u2019s left-wing populists, it\u2019s against immigrants from wealthier countries, and if it\u2019s right-wing populists, immigrants from poorer countries. But on the ground, face to face, we have found people in every country to be incredibly kind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat advice would you give to any Americans considering a big move?\n\nThe most important thing to me is to give yourself grace. Be patient with yourself. It is a lot of change. You don\u2019t have to do it all at once. You don\u2019t have to learn the whole language overnight. People are kind. They want to get to know you. They\u2019re excited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019ll have to go through all of these steps. Sometimes you might go through steps twice. We say you go through ideation, then planning, then exploration, and then you\u2019ll get into paperwork, logistics, and settling in. And if you get to Portugal and you decide it\u2019s not right for you, then that\u2019s OK. You\u2019ll start back at exploration and try another place. But just be as patient and kind with yourself as you can. It\u2019s hard to make these decisions when your blood pressure and your heart rate are through the roof and you feel threatened in a place that\u2019s supposed to be your home. And keep in mind that once you get to this safe, warm, community-oriented place, you are just going to blossom. It\u2019s going to change your life.\n\nTo hear Barnett walk a couple through their options for moving abroad, listen to the episode by clicking the player below or subscribing to How To! wherever you get your podcasts.",

            "content": "The United States (US) has always remained the top choice for higher studies among international students. According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), 3,37,630 Indian students went to the USA for higher studies in 2024. The number of Indian students in the US increased by 141.2% in 2024.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS universities have carved a niche for themselves in STEM courses. International students looking to pursue higher studies in STEM courses prefer to go to the US over other options. International students planning to pursue degrees in full-time academic programs for Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s or doctoral programs in the US must obtain a student visa. Your course of study and the type of school you plan to attend determine the exact type of visa you\u2019ll need.\n\nTypes of student visas\n\nThe most common student visas are F-1 and M-1: F-1 visas are for full-time international students pursuing academic studies, while M-1 visas are for full-time international students pursuing vocational studies.\n\nInternational students who apply for an F-1 or M-1 visa must attend a school and enroll in courses that are certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).\n\nJ-1 visa for exchange students: The J-1 exchange visitor visa is for foreign nationals who have been approved to take part in work-and-study-based exchange programs. Examples include visiting scholars, camp counselors, au pairs, and research assistants.\n\nVisitor (B) visa: A visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational course of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or academic certificate. Learn more about Visitor Visas. Study leading to a US conferred degree or certificate is not permitted on a visitor (B) visa, even if it is for a short duration.\n\nForm and payment\n\nUniversity applications come out in March or April. Once accepted, you will receive either Form I-20 for F-1 and M-1 student visa or Form DS-2019 for J-1 student visa from your school. After getting your form, you will need to pay the SEVIS I-901 fee online. The cost is $350 for F-1/M-1 students and $220 for J-1 students.\n\nCan you work with a student visa?\n\nSince, higher education in the US amounting to lakhs per annum many students prefer to have a side hustle to meet expenses. However, there are certain conditions to fulfill in such cases.\n\nIf you have an F-1, M-1, or J-1 visa, you may be eligible to work in the US. But you may only qualify for work on-campus or at a job related to your studies. J-1 visa holders must contact their responsible officer to find out if they qualify for work outside their program of study.",

            "content": "Almost 1,000 Palestinian and Israeli nationals have been offered temporary humanitarian visas in Australia since last October, new data shows, as the six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza begins.\n\nThe humanitarian pathway for those affected by the conflict was introduced in October 2024 for the more than 1,300 Palestinians in Australia on visitor visas but prevents them from applying for permanent protection.\n\nAdvocates have applauded the new two-stage process, which gives visa holders access to social benefits and grants them working rights, but remain critical of the lack of pathways for permanent protection.\n\nThe home affairs department has offered 995 Palestinian and Israeli nationals the three-year humanitarian visa as of 15 January, figures obtained by Guardian Australia show.\n\nMore than 210 have been granted the subclass 449 visa. This first stage of the process gives visa holders access to social payments, working and study rights as well as settlement and transition programs, including English tuition classes.\n\nSixty-six others have been granted the subclass 786 visa, which allows visa holders to access Medicare.\n\nThe home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said the pathway was similar to that offered to Ukrainians in 2022 after Russia invaded.\n\n\u201cAfter extensive security checks, we have been offering humanitarian visas to people affected by the conflict in Gaza. This is the same visa which was offered to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine,\u201d Burke said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainians who were given the temporary humanitarian visa are now going through the process of attaining permanent visas.\u201d\n\nBefore the temporary pathway was introduced for the Gaza conflict in October 2024, 1,033 Palestinians had applied onshore for permanent protection.\n\nThe figure had been steadily climbing throughout 2024, growing by another 55 in November. However, lodgements had dropped to fewer than 26 by the end of December 2024, the department\u2019s figures show.\n\nWhile the temporary visa provides those fleeing the conflict with additional rights, the department warned individuals it precludes them from also applying for a permanent protection visa.\n\nSome Ukrainians who fled Russia\u2019s invasion on expiring temporary humanitarian visas have since been offered permanent pathways in Australia, leaving the possibility open for a future government to do the same for Palestinians.\n\nSarah Dale, director of the Refugee Advice and Casework Service (Racs), said permanent protection was needed \u201cgiven the horror that we have seen in Gaza\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is apparent that this community has very real and significant protection needs. It\u2019s Racs\u2019s view that we should be acknowledging those protection needs and granting people permanent protection,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Greens senator David Shoebridge said the process had been too slow.\n\nUnlike other visas processes, Palestinian and Israeli nationals fleeing the conflict cannot apply for the temporary humanitarian visa. It is only available by invitation of the home affairs minister.\n\nShoebridge said Australia needed to overhaul its visa rules in responding to international crises to avoid the process being impacted by \u201cnarrow political interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to return this to the department to process visas independently, not based on the next opinion poll,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAfter years of ad hoc refugee responses to rolling disasters in Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Palestine, it is clear we need a simpler and predictable policy in place for future crises. This disaster-by-disaster approach only benefits the minister at the time, who can wield discretionary visas powers based on narrow political interests.\u201d\n\nAn initial six-week ceasefire between Israeli and Hamas forces in Gaza came into effect on Sunday afternoon Australian time.\n\nThe deal \u2013 announced by Qatar\u2019s prime minister \u2013 has three phases, including a prisoner and hostage swap, and is seen as a stepping stone towards ending a conflict that has resulted in the deaths of more than 46,000 Palestinians in the territory.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned Israel\u2019s \u201ccampaign is not over yet\u201d and has reserved the \u201cright to resume fighting if the second stage is fruitless\u201d.\n\nAnthony Albanese said he was \u201ccertainly hopeful\u201d the ceasefire would hold.\n\n\u201cWe want to see hostages released, we want to see proper aid be able to get to the people of Gaza and we want Israelis and Palestinians to be able to live in peace and security,\u201d the prime minister said on Sunday.\n\nNine in 10 homes in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged, the latest UN figures show, with about 60% of buildings across the besieged strip estimated to be damaged or destroyed.\n\nIn January, the World Health Organisation said there had been 654 attacks on health facilities recorded since the start of the war and almost every school building in Gaza had been damaged or destroyed.",

PayPal has 432 million active users, a base that consists of merchants and consumers. As the platforms get larger, it becomes more valuable to everyone.\n\nVisa, on the other hand, counts a whopping 4.5 billion active cards in use across the globe. These are accepted at more than 130 million merchant locations worldwide. Again, as the card and merchant base grow, the network becomes increasingly valuable to both parties.\n\nPayPal and Visa benefit from the prevalence of cashless transactions, a secular trend that still has a long way to go. According to the Pew Research Center, 58% of Americans still use cash for some or all of their transactions in a typical week. This data is from 2022, so that share has likely come down. However, it shows the runway cashless transactions broadly, and PayPal and Visa specifically, have. This is true even in developed economies.\n\nInvestors will definitely appreciate that these businesses are financially lucrative. In the past five years, PayPal's operating margin has averaged 16.4%. Visa's crushes this figure, with its average operating margin on a trailing-five-year basis coming in at a ridiculous 66.1%.\n\nNotable differences\n\nThere are also some differences investors should keep in mind. For starters, PayPal's valuation is cheaper. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20 right now. That's not only a 55% discount to its historical average valuation, but it's also well below Visa's 32 P/E multiple. To be fair, though, Visa's valuation is 8% below its trailing-10-year average.\n\nHowever, Visa's premium valuation over PayPal is justified. This is the superior business, with much steadier financial performance and far better profitability.\n\nPlus, Visa faces minimal threats of disruption since it's so ingrained in our economy, as it handled $16 trillion in annualized payment volume last fiscal quarter. Just imagine the turmoil that would be caused if the Visa network went down. A sizable chunk of global commerce would be on pause.\n\nPayPal faces lots of competition, even though it's a leader in online shopping. Popular digital wallets, like Apple Pay, and personal finance apps, like Block's Cash App, attract consumers. It becomes harder for PayPal to differentiate itself in a crowded field.\n\nMerchants have compelling payment services they can choose from, too. Consequently, it's more difficult to predict what PayPal's position in the industry will look like five or 10 years from now. This adds uncertainty.\n\nInvesting approach\n\nI still think PayPal is the better stock to buy in 2025, particularly given its more attractive valuation. It does face competitive threats on all fronts. So, you can argue that it's a riskier business to own.\n\nThat's especially true when compared to Visa, which is the safer and higher-quality company, although it trades at a more expensive valuation that can certainly be a headwind to achieving strong portfolio gains. Investors should keep Visa on their watch lists until there's a sizable pullback that warrants making a purchasing decision.\n\nIn my opinion, there's a greater probability that PayPal will generate market-beating returns over the next five years.",

            "content": "Quick Hits\n\nA group of H-4 and L-2 visa holders filed a lawsuit against the secretary of homeland security in April 2021, alleging that USCIS unlawfully delayed adjudicating their I-539 and I-765 applications, resulting in loss of employment.\n\nA settlement was reached in January 2023 in which USCIS agreed to return to its pre-March 2019 practice of simultaneously adjudicating bundled I-539 and I-765 applications after approving the principal\u2019s I-129 petition, providing relief for dependent spouses who require work authorization from USCIS.\n\nThe obligations set forth in the landmark Edakunni v. Mayorkas settlement agreement reached with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on January 19, 2023, are set to expire on January 18, 2025. Under the terms of the settlement, USCIS, a component of DHS, is required to simultaneously adjudicate a properly bundled derivative H-4 or L-2 applicant\u2019s Form I-539 and Form I-765 after adjudicating the principal\u2019s Form I-129 petition.\n\nHistorically, USCIS extended premium processing of concurrently filed Forms I-539 and I-765 as a courtesy when properly bundled with the principal\u2019s Form I-129 petition. However, a March 2019 policy change adding a biometrics requirement to all Form I-539 applications made simultaneous adjudications logistically impossible. The ensuing processing delays created unduly lengthy wait times for H-4 and L-2 derivative spouses and resulted in a loss of employment by preventing many from starting or continuing their employment without a valid work permit.\n\nWhile the Edakunni settlement was a welcome return to the practice of simultaneous adjudication for H-4 and L-2 derivative applicants, USCIS has not provided any insight as to how the agency will handle properly bundled applications after January 18, 2025. Other I-539 categories that are not covered by the Edakunni settlement, such as the TD and O-3 classifications, can take anywhere between five and seven months to adjudicate based on currently posted processing times.\n\nShould USCIS revert to prior processing practices where dependent applications were handled separately, stakeholders may expect lengthy processing delays once USCIS is no longer bound by the terms of the Edakunni settlement. If this happens, H-4 and L-2 dependents could face extended processing delays, which previously led to significant employment disruptions for many spouses and their employers. It is worth noting that the settlement does not limit USCIS\u2019s authority to implement new regulations, policies, or practices concerning status extensions or EADs for qualifying noncitizens with valid H-4 or L-2 status.\n\nAs noted above, USCIS has not yet provided any updates or guidance on bundled adjudications once Edakunni sunsets in January 2025. USCIS has nonetheless taken other recent steps to provide relief to derivative dependents, as detailed below:\n\nUSCIS updated guidance in its Policy Manual in March 2022 to clarify E and L spouses are considered work authorized incident to their valid nonimmigrant status, meaning they derive work authorization through an unexpired Form I-94 indicating their derivative status and need not apply for an EAD work permit.\n\nUSCIS announced an expansion of premium processing service to certain Form I-539 and I-765 applications in January 2023, but premium processing is not currently available to H-4 or L-2 derivative applicants; USCIS reserves the right to implement another phase of premium processing expansion to these categories in the future.\n\nUSCIS announced in April 2024 that it was increasing the automatic extension of certain EAD categories from up to 180 days to up to 540 days to help prevent lapses in work authorization for applicants waiting for USCIS to adjudicate pending EAD renewal applications and ensure continuity of operations for U.S. employers.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThose most likely to be impacted by the end of Edakunni are those reapplying for EADs after their prior EADs expired and those seeking a change of status to H-4 who also submit EAD applications, since these individuals require approval from USCIS for work authorization and cannot benefit from USCIS\u2019s automatic extension policy.\n\nThis, in turn, may affect U.S. employers seeking to employ H-4 EAD applicants, potentially disrupting business operations and placing financial strains on families who rely on dual sources of income. Likewise, those seeking in-country changes of status or extensions of stay may face other administrative obstacles, such as applying for a driver\u2019s license, since most states\u2019 divisions of motor vehicles require that noncitizens present a valid Form I-94.\n\nGenerally, an I-129 petition and any accompanying I-539 and I-765 applications may not be filed more than six months prior to the date employment is scheduled to begin or six months prior to the expiration of an approved I-129 petition. Since January 18, 2025, falls on a Saturday, stakeholders seeking to benefit from the Edakunni settlement must have their applications received by USCIS by Friday, January 17, 2025.\n\nOgletree Deakins\u2019 Immigration Practice Group will continue to monitor developments and will publish updates on the Immigration blog as additional information becomes available.\n\nFollow and Subscribe\n\nLinkedIn | Instagram | Webinars | Podcasts",

            "content": "The newly passed Laken Riley Act may have repercussions for the H-1B visa program, according to a new report.\n\nThe bill, recently cleared by the U.S. Senate and awaiting President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s signature next week, includes provisions aimed at addressing undocumented immigration. Among its key mandates is the detention of undocumented immigrants accused of minor, nonviolent crimes. Another contentious provision grants state attorneys general the authority to file lawsuits compelling the federal government to deny visas to individuals from countries refusing to accept deportees. This aspect of the legislation has drawn significant public criticism, but Republican lawmakers have remained steadfast in their support.\n\nA report by The New Republic highlights concerns that this provision could be weaponized to undermine the H-1B visa program, which facilitates the entry of skilled foreign workers into the United States. The publication notes that the law\u2019s language provides state attorneys general with the ability to influence visa policies significantly. \u201cThe weapon in question,\u201d The New Republic states, \u201cwould authorize state attorneys general to bring lawsuits to force presidential administrations to deny visas to any particular country that isn\u2019t accepting deportees.\u201d\n\nREAD: Would Trump adopt more restrictive policies on business immigration? (January 10, 2025)\n\nCritics fear this mechanism could be exploited to halt visa issuance to countries like India, which supplies a large number of high-skilled tech workers under the H-1B program. Steve Bannon, a prominent critic of the visa program and a key figure in Trump\u2019s political orbit, has expressed his intent to use this provision strategically. According to New Republic\u2019s Greg Sargent, Bannon remarked, \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to use it, and we\u2019re going to get after attorneys general.\u201d\n\nBannon pointed to figures such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton as potential allies in initiating lawsuits aimed at halting visas to specific countries. He suggested that under the new law, it would be feasible for a judge to order a suspension of visas for workers from nations like India.\n\nDespite his endorsement of President Trump\u2019s broader immigration policies, Bannon emphasized his willingness to mobilize this legal provision if the administration\u2019s State Department fails to act decisively. \u201cWe certainly will call for state A.G.s to do this,\u201d he affirmed, indicating a coordinated effort to leverage the law\u2019s authority in reshaping immigration policies.\n\nThe H-1B visa program has become a focal point of a heated debate within the Republican Party. On one side, Bannon and the MAGA faction argue for stricter immigration controls, claiming that the program displaces American workers and suppresses wages. On the other side, Trump\u2019s tech industry supporters, notably Tesla CEO Elon Musk, defends the program as crucial for preserving America\u2019s global competitiveness and technological edge.\n\nIndia has long been the primary beneficiary of the H-1B program, with Indian nationals consistently receiving over 70% of these highly sought-after visas.\n\nThe bipartisan Laken Riley Act, initially introduced and passed by the House last year, was reapproved by the House of Representatives on January 7, 2025.\n\nNamed after Laken Riley, a Georgia resident tragically murdered by an undocumented migrant with a prior shoplifting citation, the bill seeks to tighten immigration enforcement. It mandates that the Department of Homeland Security, through Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), detain non-U.S. nationals who are \u201ccharged with, arrested for, convicted of, admit to having committed, or admit to committing\u201d theft-related offenses.\n\nAdditionally, the legislation empowers states to take legal action against the federal government if they determine it has violated the bill\u2019s detention and removal requirements, signaling a significant shift in the balance of immigration enforcement authority.",

Though the requirement for a degree directly related to the job remains unchanged, the interpretation has been enlarged. As such, there needs to be a \"logical connection\" between the degree and the job duties, which could open doors for professionals with diverse educational backgrounds.\n\nTo level the playing field, stricter rules are being implemented to prevent companies from flooding the system with bulk applications. This change aims to give smaller firms and individual applicants a fairer shot at securing visas.\n\nF-1 visa holders looking to switch to H-1B status will face fewer hurdles. Their F-1 status will automatically extend until April 1 of the relevant year while their H-1B application is under review, ensuring continuity in their legal status and work authorization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe reforms broaden the scope for cap-exempt organizations. Now, nonprofit and government research entities that have research as a \"fundamental activity\" \u2013 even if it's not their primary focus \u2013 can qualify for H-1B exemptions. This change could open up more opportunities in the research sector.\n\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) stated on its website, \u201cThe H-1B final rule modernizes the H-1B program by streamlining the approval process, increasing its flexibility to allow better employers to retain talented workers, and improving the integrity and oversight of the program.\u201d\n\nFor Indian techies, who have long been the backbone of the H-1B program, these changes spell good news.

            "content": "H-1B Visa Debate: New US Immigration Policy Shapes Global Talent Flow from India, China, and Beyond\n\nThe H-1B visa, a cornerstone of U.S. immigration policy, is a critical pathway for skilled foreign professionals seeking opportunities in America. For many global travelers, this visa represents a chance to work in specialized fields such as technology and engineering while contributing to the U.S. economy. However, the program has become a focal point of controversy, with proponents praising its economic benefits and critics questioning its impact on American jobs.\n\nRecent debates have intensified with high-profile figures like Elon Musk defending the program. Musk, who entered the U.S. on a visa, highlighted its role in fostering innovation, pointing to his own success with Tesla and SpaceX. On the other hand, critics such as Bernie Sanders argue that the program undercuts wages and displaces American workers in key industries.\n\nThe Role of H-1B in Global Mobility and Innovation\n\nThe H-1B visa allows U.S. companies to recruit skilled foreign workers for specialty roles, particularly in STEM fields. The program provides a temporary work authorization, typically for three years, with extensions up to six years. Many visa holders eventually secure permanent residency, further embedding themselves in the U.S. workforce.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. government approved or extended approximately 386,000 visas, despite a cap of 85,000 new visas for most employers. The median salary for H-1B workers, at $118,000, reflects the high-value positions they fill. For international professionals, the program offers a gateway to career advancement and a chance to contribute to one of the world\u2019s largest economies.\n\nEconomic Benefits for the U.S. and Beyond\n\nSupporters of the H-1B program emphasize its role in driving economic growth and innovation. Many H-1B recipients establish businesses, create jobs, and contribute to advancements in their fields. Musk, for instance, highlighted how the program has enabled the U.S. to attract global talent essential for building billion-dollar enterprises.\n\nAccording to the American Immigration Council, visa workers bring diverse skill sets that complement the domestic workforce. They help businesses expand operations within the U.S. rather than outsourcing jobs overseas. Moreover, H-1B professionals contribute to local economies through spending, investments, and taxes.\n\nEconomist Gaurav Khanna, who has extensively studied the program, noted that while American computer scientists might earn marginally higher salaries without the H-1B, the broader economy benefits significantly from the program. It fuels innovation, increases productivity, and enhances the global competitiveness of U.S. companies.\n\nConcerns Over Exploitation and Workforce Displacement\n\nCritics of the H-1B visa argue that it enables corporations to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Reports indicate instances where U.S. employees were required to train H-1B workers who eventually took over their roles. Eric Ruark, director of research at NumbersUSA, claims that many of these positions could be filled by American workers, challenging the necessity of the program.\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute reported that some employers use the H-1B program to pay below-market wages, undermining the earning potential of both foreign and domestic workers. Additionally, a study found that the top 30 H-1B employers hired over 34,000 new visa workers in 2022 while simultaneously laying off more than 85,000 employees. These practices fuel the perception that the visa program prioritizes corporate profits over fair labor practices.\n\nSanders and other critics also highlight the vulnerability of H-1B workers, who rely on their employers to maintain their visa status. This dependency can lead to exploitation, with workers hesitant to report unsafe or unfair working conditions for fear of losing their visa.\n\nChallenges in Visa Allocation and Policy Reform\n\nOne of the most criticized aspects of the H-1B program is the annual cap on new visas, which has not changed in decades. The demand for these visas often far exceeds supply, leading to a lottery system that some experts argue is inefficient. Julia Gelatt from the Migration Policy Institute described the cap as arbitrary, suggesting it fails to align with the needs of the modern economy.\n\nDespite calls for reform, political divisions have hindered progress. The Trump administration\u2019s approach to immigration, for example, raised concerns about stricter policies that could reduce visa availability. Many policymakers remain divided on the program\u2019s future, leaving its allocation and structure unchanged.\n\nImplications for the Travel and Tech Industries\n\nFor the travel and tech sectors, the H-1B visa is both a resource and a challenge. Travel companies benefit from the global mobility the program fosters, as skilled workers relocate to the U.S., bringing economic activity and innovation. Tech companies, in particular, rely on H-1B professionals to fill critical roles, ensuring the industry\u2019s continued growth and competitiveness.\n\nHowever, the debate surrounding the program influences hiring practices and creates uncertainty for companies and workers. If reforms are implemented, the travel industry could see shifts in the movement of skilled professionals, with potential ripple effects on global talent distribution.\n\nGlobal Effects on Travelers and Skilled Professionals\n\nThe H-1B visa program has a profound impact on skilled professionals worldwide. For many, it represents a unique opportunity to work in the U.S., gaining experience and contributing to cutting-edge industries. The program also fosters international collaboration, enabling the exchange of ideas and expertise across borders.\n\nFrom a global perspective, the U.S. benefits from its ability to attract top talent, maintaining its position as a leader in innovation. However, concerns about worker exploitation and unequal opportunities could prompt other nations to refine their immigration policies, creating competitive alternatives for global talent.\n\nKey Considerations for the Future\n\nAs the H-1B program continues to evolve, policymakers and industry leaders must address critical issues to ensure its effectiveness. Travelers and skilled professionals should consider the following:\n\nStay Informed: Keep track of visa policy changes and their implications for career opportunities in the U.S.\n\nKeep track of visa policy changes and their implications for career opportunities in the U.S. Explore Alternatives: Look into other countries with skilled immigration programs to diversify career prospects.\n\nThe H-1B visa program remains a vital yet contentious component of U.S. immigration policy. While it facilitates global mobility and drives economic growth, concerns over worker displacement and exploitation highlight the need for reform. For global travelers and skilled professionals, the program offers unparalleled opportunities, but its future depends on balancing innovation with fairness and equity. As the travel and tech industries adapt to these dynamics, the H-1B visa continues to shape the landscape of global talent and economic collaboration.\n\nShare On:",

The updated program aims to enhance fairness, transparency, and efficiency in the hiring of foreign talent in the United States.\n\nThe H-1B visa is a nonimmigrant program that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring advanced knowledge. Notably, Indian nationals represent a substantial majority of H-1B visa holders, accounting for 72.3% of the 386,000 visas issued in 2023. As a result, Indian tech professionals are expected to benefit significantly from these reforms.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAccording to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the revamped H-1B program will streamline the approval process and offer greater flexibility, enabling employers to retain skilled employees more effectively. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) outlined several key objectives for modernizing the program:\n\n1. Clarification of Requirements: The definition of \"specialty occupation\" has been revised to emphasise a logical connection between a degree and job duties, while still requiring that the degree be \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the position.\n\n2. Improved Transition for Students: F-1 visa holders seeking to transition to H-1B status will benefit from an automatic extension of their F-1 visas until April 1 of the relevant year while their H-1B applications are under review, minimising disruptions to their lawful status and employment.\n\n3. Revisions to Cap-Exemption Rules: Nonprofit and government research organisations that focus on research as a fundamental activity will now qualify for H-1B cap exemptions. Additionally, certain beneficiaries who provide essential support to qualifying organizations may also be eligible for cap exemptions.\n\n4. Strengthening Program Integrity: To prevent misuse of the H-1B program, employers must demonstrate the existence of a legitimate specialty occupation job for the visa beneficiary. The DHS may request documentation to verify the authenticity of the job offer, ensuring compliance with the Labor Condition Application (LCA) and confirming the employer's legal presence in the U.S.\n\nIndian H-1B visa holders work across various sectors, including healthcare and academia, but are particularly prominent in the tech industry, holding leadership roles at major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\nThe anxiety among Indian H-1B visa holders is heightened by the memory of Trump's previous presidency, during which his senior adviser, Stephen Miller, implemented policies that increased scrutiny of H-1B applications, resulting in a 24% rejection rate in 2018.",

These changes were published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024 and came into effect on January 17, 2025. The H-1B program allows American companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree (or equivalent).The new H-1B rules aim to streamline the approval process, increases employer flexibility in retaining talent, and enhances program integrity and oversight. While primarily focused on H-1B specialty occupation workers, some provisions also affect other nonimmigrant classifications, including H-2, H-3, F-1, L-1, O, P, Q-1, R-1, E-3, and TN. The current annual cap for H-1B visas stands at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 reserved for those holding advanced degrees from US institutions.The H-2 program covers temporary agricultural (H-2A) and nonagricultural (H-2B) workers. The updated H-2 rule strengthens worker protections by imposing stricter penalties on companies that charge prohibited fees or violate labor laws. It also provides greater flexibility for both H-2A and H-2B workers. The DHS aims to enhance the integrity of the H-2 programs and improve worker protections through these regulatory changes.The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented new rules to modernize and improve the H-1B (specialty occupations) and H-2 (temporary agricultural and nonagricultural workers) nonimmigrant visa programs.Both rules were published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024.The H-1B final rule aims to modernize the program by:* Streamlining the approval process. Students on F-1 visas will face fewer disruptions when shifting to H-1B status. F-1 visa students applying for an H-1B visa will benefit from an automatic extension of their F-1 visa until April 1 of that year. This will ensure continuity in lawful status and work authorisation while their H-1B application is under review. USCIS has committed to expediting applications for H-1B extensions to ease the burden on both employers as well as workers.* Increasing flexibility for employers to retain talented workers. Businesses can hire H-1B workers based on documented needs, allowing more adaptable workforce planning. ap-exempt organisations, such as universities and research bodies, can now submit petitions throughout the year without numerical limitations.* Improving the integrity and oversight of the program. The DHS may request supporting documents to verify job authenticity.

            "content": "Just days before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as US President on 20 January 2025, President Biden\u2019s administration has issued a \u201cfinal rule\u201d about the administration of the H-1B visa programme. The \u201cH-1B Modernization Rule\u201d will go into effect today, 17 January 2025.\n\n\n\nThe H1-B programme is the coveted visa route allowing US employers to temporarily hire international student graduates with specialised degrees at the bachelor\u2019s level or higher. Applications for H1-B visas are invariably higher than the quota set for them each year. About 85,000 are allocated annually. Most students obtaining an H1-B visa are hired for jobs in technology, engineering, healthcare, financial services, specialised businesses, and education (including academia).\n\nWhat\u2019s new for the H1-B?\n\nThe government press release notes that the H-1B Modernization Rule will \u201cprovide greater benefits and flexibilities for U.S. employers and specialty occupation workers, helping to meet U.S. labor needs.\u201d\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Ur M. Jaddou said:\n\n\u201cThe H-1B program was created by Congress in 1990, and there\u2019s no question it needed to be modernized to support our nation\u2019s growing economy. The changes made in today\u2019s final rule will ensure that U.S. employers can hire the highly skilled workers they need to grow and innovate while enhancing the integrity of the program.\u201d\n\nThe Rule has been set up in a way that it would be complicated for the incoming president to undo. As global legal firm Mayer-Brown notes:\n\n\u201cA president can easily rescind, modify, or replace executive orders and administrative policies without requiring public input or a lengthy procedural process. However, regulations, such as the H-1B Modernization Rule, are formal rules created by federal agencies that have the force of law and require agencies to go through a formal rulemaking process to make changes.\u201d\n\nImplications for international students\n\nFor international students, a few of the most important changes are:\n\nMore flexibility around around the degrees that make graduates eligible for an H-1B visa. Previously, degrees had to be \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the job an international graduate wanted to hold. The problem there was that a candidate could hold a degree \u2013 say an interdisciplinary degree \u2013 that would be perfect for the job requirements but because the degree was not \u201cdirectly\u201d linked to the \u201cjob,\u201d it excluded the candidate from eligibility.\n\n\n\nNow, USCIS has changed the language to \u201cin a directly related specific specialty,\u201d and defined \u201cdirectly related\u201d as meaning there is a \u201clogical connection\u201d between the degree (or its equivalent) and the \u201cduties of the position.\u201d This sounds confusing (it is) but suffice to say that the changed language is intended to allow a wider range of applicants to be eligible for the HI-B because \u201cdirect\u201d refers to niche tasks within a job rather than the job itself.\n\nImmigration Impact elaborates:\n\n\u201cUSCIS specifies in the regulation that there could be a \u2018range of qualifying degree fields\u2019 if each field is \u2018directly related to the duties of the position.\u2019 USCIS also addressed that it was not focusing on degree titles and would consider whether the noncitizen\u2019s \u2018actual course of study is directly related to the duties of the position.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile this change sounds promising at first bounce, there are some experts who worry about how officials reviewing applications will determine a \u201clogical connection\u201d and that decisions may be made subjectively. However, the new rule does reflect the nuanced roles that employers now need to fill \u2013 roles that don\u2019t necessarily correspond to a specific degree \u2013 and is strategically sound as a result.\n\nMore time for international graduates on an F-1 visa to transition to an H1-B visa. Previously, F-1 visa holders sometimes \u2013 through no fault of their own \u2013 saw their immigration status lapse because of delays in processing their H1-B petition. Most F-1 students complete their programmes or related Optional Practical Training (OPT) in the spring or summer. Previously, they only had 60 days to maintain their legal status. If their H1-B petition was not processed by October 1, those students would have to leave the US. Now, the \u201cgap\u201d between the F-1 and H1-B visa has been extended to April 1. The formal USCIS language for this rule is the \u201cautomatic \u2018cap-gap\u2019 extension\u201d has been \u201ccodified.\u201d\n\nNew eligibility for entrepreneurs. If an international student/worker has a \u201ccontrolling interest\u201d in their own business (i.e., owns at least 50% of it), they are now eligible for H1-B status \u201csubject to reasonable conditions.\u201d However, the maximum validity period for this category of H-1B validity is 18 months for the first visa as well as the first extension of it. Other H-1B visas\u2019 validity is up to three years.\n\nAn expansion of the type of non-profit and governmental organisations that are exempt from the annual caps on H-1B visas. Those organisations used to have to prove their \u201cprimary mission\u201d was research, but now they must only prove that research is \u201cone of their fundamental activities.\u201d\n\nStrengthened integrity\n\nAs well as its intention to make it easier for American employers to hire talented foreign workers, the \u201cfinal rule\u201d affecting the H1-B programme also includes provisions for immigration authorities to apply greater scrutiny to employers and workers. For example, immigration authorities will check that the \u201cpetitioner\u201d (i.e., the employer) has a \u201cbona fide\u201d (genuine) job opening for the H1-B worker and doesn\u2019t just anticipate having one.\n\nThere are several other stipulations, but they all amount to employers needing to submit more documentation and to be ready for site visits from immigration authorities at any time. If inaccurate information is provided by the employer or if anything else seems suspect, USCIS will impose stiff penalties.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas said:\n\n\u201cAmerican businesses rely on the H-1B visa program for the recruitment of highly skilled talent, benefitting communities across the country. These improvements to the program provide employers with greater flexibility to hire global talent, boost our economic competitiveness, and allow highly skilled workers to continue to advance American innovation.\u201d\n\nGood news for J-1 students as well\n\nIn December, the State Department recently made it easier for some J-1 visa holders (those on work/study exchange programmes) to remain in the U.S. by narrowing the list of countries on the Exchange Visitor Skills List to 45 countries.\n\nStudents from those 45 countries must return home for a period of two years before applying for another US visa because their countries are deemed to have a pressing need for their specialised skills (e.g., Engineering). The intention is to reduce brain drain from developing countries.\n\nThe way the current list has been devised, countries with a per capita GDP under US$7,500 or those where the rate of outbound migration is notably high are considered as likely to benefit from its students (on J-1 visas) returning to work for at least two years.\n\nIndia and China have been removed from the list \u2013 which is a major development given the number of students from those countries studying in the US. The number of Chinese students on J-1 visas grew by 120% in 2023 compared with a 30% drop in Chinese on F-1 visas. Similarly, there was growth of 122% for Indians on J-1 visas (compared with a 43% rise in those on F-1 visas).\n\nOther countries that have been removed are Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the UAE.\n\nWhat will happen when President-elect Trump is sworn in on 20 January?\n\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty about what immigration policies governing highly skilled foreign workers and STEM students will look like under President-elect Trump. This time round, Trump is highly influenced and supported by the high-tech community in the US, including Tesla/X\u2019s Elon Musk. Musk is in favour of the H-1B programme but believes it needs reforms, including raising the minimum salary for H-1B visa holders and increasing the cost employers must pay for hiring and retaining H-1B workers.\n\nBut a significant proportion of other powerful Republicans oppose the H-1B programme, and they will mount a vigorous opposition to Musk\u2019s position.\n\nWhatever happens, research has shown that the H-1B programme drives innovation in the US and creates \u2013 rather than takes away \u2013 jobs for American citizens. Writing in the January 2025 issue of The Atlantic, Rog\u00e9 Karma explains:\n\n\u201cMost careful experimental studies on the program find that, overall, it has neutral or positive effects on the employment prospects and wages of native-born workers. Companies that receive H-1B visas tend to grow faster than companies that don\u2019t\u2014likely because many of them really are hiring foreign workers whose skills they need\u2014and thus often end up employing more native workers overall. Employers receiving H-1B visas also tend to develop new products and technologies at higher rates, which helps create new jobs.\u201d\n\nFor additional background, please see:",

The rates then declined to 21% in financial year 2019, 13% the following year, 4% in FY 2021, and just 2% in the year after that.\n\nMurray believes that while Trump\u2019s recent comments and the ensuing backlash create uncertainty for the international education community in the US, it is still crucial to take his statements seriously.\n\n\u201cAs the incoming president, we must take what he says seriously while also recognizing that ultimately, actions are most important. We must wait to see what actions he and his administration take once he is sworn in,\u201d said Murray.\n\nAccording to Clay Harmon, executive director, AIRC, Trump\u2019s comments are a \u201cbroad recognition across many sectors and perspectives that the US education system and economy offer excellent opportunities to people from all over the world\u201d.\n\n\u201cA significant portion of US political and business leadership place value on supporting US employers\u2019 ability to attract global talent,\u201d said Harmon.\n\n\u201cI would caution international students against reading any further into his remarks during the transition period.\u201d\n\nLast month, the outgoing Biden administration announced a rule to modernise the H1-B visa programme, aiming to streamline the approval process, enhance employers\u2019 ability to recruit overseas talent, and impose penalties on companies that misuse the system.\n\nEffective January 17, 2025, the rule introduces extended protections for F-1 students transitioning to H-1B status to prevent disruptions in employment authorisation.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Department of Homeland Security has issued a new final rule to simplify and streamline some parts of the H-1B application process, which should make it easier for some international students to transition to H-1Bs,\u201d said Harmon.\n\nDespite the recent changes, many international graduates, particularly those in STEM fields, feel that the ongoing debate surrounding the H-1B program directly affects them.\n\nSahil Mhatre, who completed his post graduation in computer science from Syracuse University, is one such individual.\n\n\u201cAs an international graduate, the current rhetoric around the H-1B visa does add some stress, primarily because it limits my immediate job opportunities,\u201d said Mhatre.\n\n\u201cMy friends and colleagues do express some anxiety, mainly because, while many top firms are still providing H-1B sponsorship, landing a position at these firms has become increasingly competitive.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mhatre, many of his American colleagues and friends \u201cvalue the contribution of international professionals\u201d, and he rarely encounters anyone opposing H-1Bs.\n\n\u201cHowever, I have heard that some Americans are concerned about the potential impact on local jobs, especially given the unstable job market and economic factors,\u201d stated Mhatre.\n\nThe discussion surrounding the H-1B program arises as US universities urge international students to return to campuses before Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20.\n\nThese advisories stem from concerns that the incoming administration might enact a travel ban similar to the one that left many students stranded abroad at the beginning of Trump\u2019s previous term.\n\nCertainly, governmental policies here and there could have an impact, good or bad, in terms of increasing student enrolment\n\nFred Pestello, St. Louis University\n\nAccording to Fred Pestello, president, St. Louis University, it\u2019s important to take a wait-and-watch approach rather than giving into any speculations surrounding the incoming administration\u2019s approach towards international students.\n\n\u201cCertainly, governmental policies here and there could have an impact, good or bad, in terms of increasing student enrolment. I guess it\u2019s a lot of speculation, but it\u2019s not yet known what direction the incoming administration would take with respect to this,\u201d Pestello told The PIE News.\n\n\u201cI am hoping for a policy that allows as much free flow as possible for students across nations to pursue their dreams and aspirations through education. I believe it\u2019s beneficial for everyone to have the flexibility for students to study where they wish, for the reasons that matter most to them.\u201d",

            "content": "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy both came out recently in favor of expanding the H-1B visa program. This program allows large corporations to claim they cannot find adequate skilled talent (engineers for example) and sponsor a foreign worker to enter the United States to fill the required role.\n\nThe program itself is rife with abuse and inevitably and negatively affects American citizens by adding to the supply of talent and inevitably decreasing the price of such talent (wages).\n\nSome disagree with Musk and Ramaswamy. Many identify as MAGA and argue that it is counter to Trump's desire to limit immigration. Yet Trump himself has said he supports the H-1B program. He has also recently said that foreign students graduating from American universities should automatically qualify for a Green Card (permanent residency). This would allow them to work without needing a visa and put them on the path to naturalized citizenship.\n\nRamaswamy included commentary on American cultural failings in not producing enough home-grown talent. Musk used a sports metaphor to argue that bringing in foreign talent was necessary to keep the U.S. on top economically. While these arguments have elements of truth, they also fail to consider some key points.\n\nFor some context on this opinion, I wrote early in 2024 that we should stop all immigration for an extended period , including H-1B visas, while we fixed the mess we were currently in, and have a national debate about how immigration should be handled going forward. I stand by that opinion, as well as my suggestion for a kinder and gentler mass deportation . While I am pro-immigrant, I believe these steps are necessary for a cultural and policy reset. As beneficial as immigration has been to our shared history, our current policy is polarizing us from many directions while failing to make America better.\n\nSign up for The Fulcrum newsletter\n\nRamaswamy\u2019s commentary on cultural failings is not wrong though they could also be defined as educational shortcomings. That is on us as parents (and grandparents), and our political and business leaders to fix. The H-1B program not only ignores those problems but gives us a seemingly cheap way out to avoid fixing them.\n\nI have low expectations that politicians or our universities will fix this problem. However, I have high expectations that big business could fix the problem if the H-1B program were unavailable. Simplistically speaking, they could hire young technology interns, give them on-the-job training, sponsor their advanced education, and meritoriously promote and pay the best.\n\nMusk meanwhile decided to clarify his position, stating that he only wanted to bring in the top 0.1% of talent from foreign countries. However, these arguments assume that economics is a zero-sum competition between nations. In his world, H-1B becomes a weapon of economic war in our effort to stay on top.\n\nEssentially, Musk is suggesting we use H-1B not just to advance our economy but to debilitate other countries in their effort to advance their economies. And in doing so we inevitably hurt ourselves.\n\nWhat happens when other nations (especially so-called third-world nations) advance economically and educationally? Does it cause us damage? On the contrary, in a free trade environment, when other nations become stronger economically, they become bigger markets for American-made goods and services. They also provide quality, cost-effective goods and services to Americans. And robust economies create a more cooperative and peaceful world. Buying and selling with each other is more advantageous than waging actual war.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I am a died-in-the-wool capitalist (actually a \u201cfree-marketist\u201d but that is a subject for another day). I believe competition between market participants is good. And yes, it often results in creative destruction when some firms fail while others are born. But the competition should be among those market participants and not among nations.\n\nLet\u2019s not wage economic warfare to paper over our internal problems. Put the H-1B program on ice and fix those problems instead.\n\nDavid Butler is a husband, father, grandfather, business executive, entrepreneur, and political observer.",

            "content": "By: Justin Kennedy and Mishita Jethi\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has finalized its updates to the H-1B visa regulations, initially proposed in October 2023. These changes will go into effect on January 17, 2025 and the complete rule can be found on the Federal Register website. While certain updates, especially those affecting the annual visa selection process, have already been implemented since March 2024, the final rule largely mirrors the original proposal with a few key revisions that offer benefits to employers.\n\nThe new rule is designed to offer more flexibility for employers and foreign workers by (i) updating the criteria for specialty occupation positions and organizations such as nonprofits and government research institutions that are exempt from the annual H-1B visa cap and (ii) strengthening cap gap protections for F-1 students. Further, the new rule provides additional clarity to H-1B amendment requirements and codifies USCIS\u2019 policy of deference to prior approvals. These changes are designed to help U.S. businesses attract and retain the talent they need, to remain competitive in the global economy.\n\nKey Takeaways from the Rule\n\nThe final regulation introduces several key provisions that clarify and expand the scope of H-1B visa eligibility, including provisions aimed at addressing specific employment-related issues. One notable change is the revision of the definition of qualifying H-1B occupations. The updated rule offers more flexibility by allowing positions that \u201cnormally\u201d require a bachelor's degree to qualify, even if the degree is not always required. It also clarifies that a position may qualify for an H-1B visa if the employer accepts a variety of degree fields, provided that each field is \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the job duties. Additionally, the final rule includes provisions for off-site placements, specifying that when an H-1B beneficiary is staffed at a third-party client location, that the third party\u2019s requirements\u2014rather than the petitioner\u2019s\u2014will determine the position\u2019s eligibility as a specialty occupation.\n\nThe new rule also strengthens USCIS\u2019s authority to conduct inspections and enforce penalties for violations, thus ensuring compliance and preserving program integrity. Employers must demonstrate that a legitimate specialty occupation role exists for the worker by the requested start date, ensure the Labor Condition Application aligns with the H-1B petition, and verify their legal presence and accountability in the U.S.\n\nAnother significant update is the formalization of USCIS\u2019s policy on deference to prior nonimmigrant adjudications. The rule establishes that USCIS will defer to previous I-129 approvals when the same parties and facts are involved, unless there have been material changes in circumstances or eligibility. This change provides employers with greater predictability when filing new petitions, reducing the likelihood of requests for evidence (RFEs) or denials. The rule also strengthens the requirements for H-1B location changes, clarifying when petition amendments are necessary and codifying when changes within the intended employment area do not require amendments. Furthermore, the regulation clarifies the eligibility of business owners with a controlling interest in their petitioning entity, allowing them to apply for H-1B status, provided they will be performing specialty occupation duties the majority of the time.\n\nFor international students on F-1 visas transitioning to H-1B status, the rule also provides options to maintain legal status and work authorization, minimizing potential disruptions. It streamlines the process for individuals who have previously held an H-1B visa, thus enabling quicker application processing. Additionally, the rule extends H-1B eligibility to individuals with a controlling interest in their sponsoring organization, provided they meet certain conditions.\n\nThe final regulation also expands the scope of H-1B cap exemptions for certain nonprofit and governmental research organizations, recognizing that research or education need not be the organization\u2019s primary mission to qualify for exemption. Finally, beginning January 17, 2025, employers will need to use a revised version of Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, for all H-1B applications. USCIS will soon release a preview of the updated form on its website, and no grace period will be allowed for using older versions.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor more information on the H-1B modernization rule, refer to the Federal Register website.

The updated regulations, to allow highly skilled workers to stay in the US based on their employment status, form one of the final immigration policy reforms under the outgoing President Joe Biden administration.\n\nThe H-1B visa programme, which has been instrumental in attracting global talent, will undergo a series of updates designed to modernise its framework and address current issues.\n\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) stated on its website, \u201cThe H-1B final rule modernizes the H-1B program by streamlining the approval process, increasing its flexibility to allow better employers to retain talented workers, and improving the integrity and oversight of the program.\u201d\n\nWith Indian professionals comprising over 70 percent of H-1B visa holders in 2023, these changes could substantially benefit them.\n\nKey Changes To H-1B Visa Rules\n\n\u2018Specialty occupation' definition: The new rule updates the definition of \u201cspeciality occupation\u201d by revising the criteria for eligible positions. It clarifies that a degree requirement is \u201cnormally\u201d needed, not \u201calways,\u201d and allows a broader range of qualifying degrees, as long as they are directly related to the job.\n\nFairer lottery process: Stricter measures will curb organisations submitting multiple bulk applications, ensuring a more equitable system.\n\nSimplified transition for F-1 visa holders: Students with F-1 visas will experience fewer challenges when moving to H-1B status.\n\nFaster processing: USCIS will expedite H-1B extension applications, reducing delays for workers and employers.\n\nMore flexibility for employers: Companies can hire H-1B workers based on their specific workforce needs, supporting dynamic workforce planning.\n\nOpportunities for entrepreneurs: Entrepreneurs owning a majority stake in their company can now self-petition for H-1B visas, provided they meet stricter conditions.\n\nStronger compliance safeguards: Enhanced site visit authority for USCIS, including inspections at worksites, remote locations, and third-party sites aim to deter misuse. Failure to verify information during inspections may lead to denial or revocation of H-1B petitions.\n\nNew petition form: A newly updated Form I-129 will be mandatory starting January 17, 2025, for improved compliance. This form aims to simplify the petition process.\n\nExpanded cap-exempt criteria: Research-focused organisations qualify as cap-exempt under a clearer definition, replacing vague earlier guidelines.\n\nAdditionally, a significant change is on the horizon \u2014 H-1B visa holders will soon be able to renew their visas without travelling back to their home country. This is likely to help Indian techies who are H-1B visa holders in the US.\n\nWill H-1B Visa Policies Shift Under Donald Trump's Administration?\n\nWhile certain factions of the Republican Party have advocated for tighter immigration controls, including limiting programs like H-1B, US-President elect Donald Trump has in recent times expressed support for high-skilled immigration. \u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It's a great programme,\u201d Trump told The New York Times in December 2024.\n\nIn the past, though, during his first presidency, Trump restricted access to foreign worker visas and was even critical of the programme.",

Recent statements by Trump advisors Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, along with President-Elect Donald Trump himself, suggest the second Trump Administration may take a more favorable stance on H-1B visas compared to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach of the past.\n\nOn Dec. 28, 2024, Trump surprised many by declaring his support for the H-1B program, calling himself a \u201cbeliever in H-1B.\u201d This followed his appointment of Sriram Krishnan as senior policy adviser on artificial intelligence \u2014 a decision that drew criticism due to Krishnan\u2019s advocacy for \u201cunlocking skilled immigration,\u201d a stance seemingly at odds with past policies.\n\nThis shift in tone could align immigration policy with industry needs, offering opportunities to address talent gaps in critical sectors. As debates continue, the H-1B program\u2019s role in driving innovation and bridging workforce shortages remains essential \u2014 a development employers relying on foreign talent cannot afford to overlook.\n\nIntroduced in 1990, the H-1B program allows U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign nationals for \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d requiring at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. It has played a pivotal role in filling talent gaps in technology, healthcare, life sciences, and finance. By enabling access to global talent, the program has been instrumental in sustaining U.S. dominance in technology and innovation. Leading companies depend on H-1B workers, many of whom occupy positions in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, fields. While the majority of STEM positions are filled by U.S. workers, the share of foreign workers \u2014 including H-1B visa holders \u2014 has more than doubled to 26 percent between 1990 and 2023 \u2014 a testament to the program\u2019s importance for maintaining America\u2019s competitive edge.\n\nCritics of the H-1B program have long argued that it encourages cheap labor and undermines the competitiveness of U.S. workers. They also have voiced concerns about the perceived dependency of H-1B workers on their employer-sponsors, which they allege limits the mobility of these workers. However, these criticisms fail to acknowledge safeguards and provisions already embedded in the program, including:\n\nWage Protections: Employers sponsoring H-1B workers must adhere to strict Department of Labor wage guidelines. They are required to submit a Labor Condition Application certifying that the H-1B worker will be paid at least the prevailing wage \u2014 the average salary for similar roles in the geographic area of employment. USCIS data indicates an average salary of nearly $130,000 annually for computer-related occupations, which could hardly be described as \u201ccheap labor.\u201d\n\nJob Portability: The notion that H-1B workers are tied to their sponsors ignores the portability provisions of the program. Under the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act, H-1B workers can change employers by filing a new petition. In FY 2023, USCIS received 75,843 \u201cchange of employer\u201d petitions \u2014 nearly 90% percent of the annual H-1B cap. This highlights the program\u2019s flexibility and dispels the myth that workers are bound to their original employers.\n\nCap-Exempt Employers: A significant portion of H-1B visas is allocated to \u201ccap-exempt\u201d employers, such as universities and research institutions, highlighting the importance of foreign talent in advancing innovation. Yet, the debate often overlooks how these institutions contribute to the economy and workforce development.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nDespite criticism, the H-1B program remains a cornerstone of the U.S. workforce strategy, with demand continuing to outpace supply. For FY 2025, USCIS received 470,342 registrations for just 85,000 available visas \u2014 a testament to its enduring popularity and importance in addressing skills gaps.\n\nAs the next H-1B cap lottery process approaches in March, employers should stay informed and prepared, collaborating with immigration counsel to navigate potential changes under the incoming administration.\n\nJackson Lewis attorneys are closely monitoring the evolving landscape of H-1B regulations and are here to guide employers through every step of the process.

You\u2019ll also find a specific action plan so you can adapt your immigration strategy given this month\u2019s information. Read on to ensure you follow compliant processes that address your critical workforce needs in a timely manner.\n\nFebruary Dates: An Overview\n\nThe Visa Bulletin includes a list of dates informing overseas immigrant visa applicants when they should expect to be notified to assemble and submit required documentation to move forward with the consular stamping process. These dates are also used to determine eligibility for Adjustment of Status to Lawful Permanent Residence with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for applicants who are already physically present in the U.S.\n\nRetrogression from Dates of Filing to Final Action\n\nUSCIS announced that it will follow the State Department\u2019s Final Action Chart , published in the February Visa Bulletin to determine whether candidates are eligible to submit an employment-based Adjustment of Status application for that month. This is a considerable change from the last few months where USCIS relied on the Dates of Filing chart, which permitted Adjustment of Status applications to be filed at an earlier date.\n\nTo determine potential eligibility for filing of an employment-based Adjustment of Status application, dates that appear in this chart must be compared with an employee\u2019s immigration priority date, as shown on their earliest available I-797 Notice of Action (Receipt Notice) issued by USCIS for any EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 (I-140) Immigrant Petition filed on their behalf by a sponsoring employer. By relying on the Final Action chart, most immigrant visa categories will have a several months delay in when an application may be filed.\n\nAs most categories will retrogress in February, employers should promptly review employees' priority dates and ensure all eligible adjustment of status applications are prepared and filed before the chart change takes effect. Employers should also communicate with affected employees, coordinate with immigration counsel, and gather necessary documentation, such as Form I-485, medical exams, and supporting evidence, to avoid processing delays. Proactive planning is essential to maximize filing opportunities and minimize disruptions.\n\nRetrogression Summary\n\nFor Indian Nationals :\n\nEB-1 Date for Filing will regress two months under the Final Action date.\n\nEB-2 Date for Filing will regress six months under the Final Action date.\n\nEB-3 Date for Filing will regress four months under the Final Action date.\n\nFor Chinese Nationals :\n\nEB-1 Date for Filing will regress two months under the Final Action date.\n\nEB-2 Date for Filing will regress three months under the Final Action date.\n\nEB-3 Date for Filing will regress six months under the Final Action date.\n\nAll Other Nationals :\n\nEB-2 Date for Filing will regress four months under the Final Action date.\n\nEB-3 Date for Filing will regress three months under the Final Action date.\n\nFinal Action Chart\n\nThe recently announced Final Action Chart for EB-1, EB-2 and EB-3 appear in the table below. Please note this table can always change, so check here for the most accurate and updated information before acting on these dates.\n\nPreference All Chargeability\n\nAreas Except\n\nThose Listed CHINA-\n\nmainland\n\nborn INDIA MEXICO PHILIPPINES 1st Current 08 NOV 22 01 FEB 22 Current Current 2nd 01 APR 23 22 APR 20 15 OCT 12 01 APR 23 01 APR 23 3rd 01 DEC 22 01 JUL 20 15 DEC 12 01 DEC 22 01 DEC 22\n\nWhat Should You Do? Your Action Plan\n\nFor February, USCIS is using the \u201cFinal Action\u201d chart in accepting new applications for Adjustment of Status to Lawful Permanent Residence. This means an application may be filed and processed for a candidate with an immigration priority date that is earlier than the listed cutoff date for their preference category and country of chargeability, or whose category is otherwise listed as current.\n\nFor Adjustment of Status cases that are already pending and were filed in a category that has since fallen behind in its cutoff date, USCIS will not begin processing until the Final Action date has surpassed the individual immigration priority date or is otherwise deemed current. While overall processing may be delayed, a duly filed application will remain in good standing in the government\u2019s queue, and USCIS will process related requests for EAD cards and Advanced Parole.\n\nIf you have employees who have priority dates that will be (or remain) current in February, you should reach out to your immigration attorney to prepare and submit their Adjustment of Status Application in February.",

What is lesser known is that migrants from some of the same countries have a legal route to work on American farms for a limited time. Farm labourer Sandra Noemi Bucu Saz is happy. She's recently returned to Guatemala in Central America from the US, where she was picking strawberries in California. \"They paid us $19 (\u00a315.60) an hour,\" says Sandra. \"We were asked to pick seven boxes per hour, and if we picked more, then we got paid a bit extra. \"It's so different to what I get paid in Guatemala, which is around $10 per day, when there's work.\" Sandra is one of around 5,000 Guatemalans who go and work \u2013 legally - in the US every year, thanks to a US government visa scheme for temporary agriculture workers from overseas, called H-2A. This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.\n\nFor people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas. It's a cold, grey, windy day in southern Guatemala as Sanda proudly shows off the plot of land she rents in a place called Las Tres Cruces, high up in the hills near a town where she lives with her family, called Santiago Sacatep\u00e9quez. She and her relatives grow corn, lettuce, beans and spinach for them to eat. And if there's enough left over they sell them at the local market. Sandra's dream is to save enough money to buy some land, so they don't have to rent. But first she needs to pay off the rest of the debt that she got herself in to after being scammed when she and her sister first tried to get a visa for the United States. \"We paid someone $2,000 per person because we wanted to get work in the US,\" she says. \"My sister and I thought we needed to do this so we could move forward and make our dreams come true. So, we got a loan to get the money, but sadly it was all a scam, and they took our money.\" This is common practice for fraudsters in Guatemala, who play with people's desperation to get to the US, and trick them into handing over money.\n\nGetty Images Many US farms have to rely on migrant workers to harvest their crops\n\nCesia Ochoa is the executive director for the Guatemala branch of a legitimate recruitment company called Cierto. A business that also has offices in the US and Mexico, it is one of the 30 or so officially registered in Guatemala to offer H-2A visas. \"Part of our inspiration for opening an office in Guatemala was to help locals avoid the scams,\" she says. When Sandra went to the US via Cierto, she didn't have to pay it a fee. Instead, the company is paid by farm businesses in the US looking for temporary workers. Ms Ochoa explains: \"For us, it's really important that we make a good contact between businesses and the workers, and that the salaries and contract they are offering are real.\" While the H-2A visa allows people from Guatemala to legally find temporary farm work in the US, there is estimated to be more than 675,000 undocumented Guatemalans in the US, according to the Pew Research Center think tank. And a further 200,000 were found to have tried to enter the US without valid documentation in the 12 months to September of last year. That is the third highest number behind Mexicans and Venezuelans.\n\nOlga Romero lives near a town called Olopa in the north-east of Guatemala. She has seven children, two of whom are working in the US without any visas. \"This is a poor region where work is hard to find, and families often pay someone called a coyote between $2,000 and $3,000 to take them to the US illegally,\" says Olga. A big problem is that to raise that amount of money many families need to take out loans secured against the value of their home. They can then lose their properties if the money isn't paid back. And that is often the case, given that the chance of them making it to the US is far from guaranteed, with the risk of accidents along the way, or being turned back at the US border. But the rewards are high. The money loved ones send back from the US is known as remittances, and these are propping up Guatemala's economy. In 2023 the country received $19.8bn in total remittances from abroad, according to one study from the Inter-American Development Bank. President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough on undocumented immigrants, and is threatening to carry out mass deportations . But it is not yet clear if he will make moves to limit, or even stop, H-2A and the other visa schemes for temporary foreign workers.\n\nGetty Images Trump has vowed to deport illegal migrants, such as these who crossed into the US last summer\n\nVanessa Garc\u00eda, executive director of recruitment organisation Juan Francisco Garcia Comparini Foundation, is optimistic that such visas will continue. The foundation helps send around 200 Guatemalans a year to work in the US with H-2A visas. These are farm labourers who help to harvest lettuces, cauliflowers, spinach and beans. \"I think that the opportunities for Guatemalans to get an H-2A visa will continue and perhaps even grow,\" she says. \"I am not worried, and I think this is a great opportunity for workers.\" Joe Martinez, the US-based founder and CEO of Cierto, says that while he expects the visa scheme to continue under Trump, rights for the foreign workers might be weakened. \"Cierto is concerned that the push to streamline and reduce bureaucratic processes could lead to a program with less worker protections and less oversight.\" He is worried that wages could fall for the farmworkers, and that their housing conditions on US farms may worsen.\n\nH\u00e9ctor Benjam\u00edn Xoc Xar H\u00e9ctor Benjam\u00edn Xoc Xar says he worked in the US so that he could afford to give his children a good education",

            "content": "Trump\u2019s tech allies Musk and Ramaswamy are at loggerheads with the MAGA camp over a visa programme that brings foreign workers.\n\nDays before Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States, a feud between his tech allies and champions of his far-right MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda over H-1B visas has exploded.\n\nFormer White House adviser Steve Bannon accused Elon Musk of trying to establish \u201ctechno-feudalism on a global scale\u201d in a fresh broadside against the billionaire businessman this week.\n\nBannon\u2019s sharp rhetoric against the controversial visa programme, which allows the hiring of highly skilled tech workers from overseas, has come as others in Trump\u2019s orbit, such as entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, have also tried to argue that US companies need trained foreign employees.\n\nThat argument has come under fire not just from Bannon, but also from other far-right supporters of Trump \u2013 even as Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with cutting government spending in his new administration, have now softened their position on H-1B visas. Following the backlash, the tech barons have said that the programme needs to be reformed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what is the H-1B scheme that is splitting Trump\u2019s allies? Why is it so divisive? Has Trump\u2019s own U-turn on the issue contributed to tensions within the MAGA movement? And how will Trump manage the division between his MAGA base and Big Tech \u2013 a sector that traditionally leaned towards the Democrats but has in recent weeks almost bent over backwards to placate the incoming president?\n\nHas Trump flip-flopped on H-1B visas?\n\nThe H-1B is a temporary and non-immigrant US visa that allows companies in the US to bring in highly skilled workers from abroad.\n\nIn 2016, Trump called the programme, which was introduced in the 1990s under Republican President George HW Bush, \u201cvery, very bad\u201d for American workers.\n\nMonths before the end of his first term as president in 2020, Trump imposed a temporary ban on H-1B visas, which was later struck down by a federal court.\n\nBut less than five years later, the US president-elect has thrown his weight behind the visa scheme, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a great programme.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B,\u201d he told New York Post.\n\nThose comments came at a time when Musk was facing pushback from MAGA supporters.\n\nMusk played a key role in Trump\u2019s win as he pumped money into the presidential campaign and used X to megaphone hardline MAGA views. That has earned him Trump\u2019s goodwill and influence.\n\nBut Trump has pushed back on the notion that Musk enjoys outsized influence. \u201cAnd no, he\u2019s not taking the presidency,\u201d Trump made the comments during a speech in December, days after the Tesla owner led efforts to kill a spending bill in Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts say Trump will need to manage a delicate balance between the Silicon Valley elite, whom he needs for his plans to create jobs, and the MAGA base, from where he draws his political support.\n\nWhat is an H-1B visa \u2013 and which companies benefit most?\n\nThe H-1B is \u201cthe largest temporary work visa\u201d programme in the US, said Jeanne Batalova, a senior policy analyst at Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, DC-headquartered think tank.\n\nThere is an annual cap on the number of H-1B visas guaranteed, set to 65,000 H-1B visas per fiscal year. It is decided by a lottery system, which randomly selects when the number of visa petitions exceeds the cap.\n\nThe foreign worker must be employed in a specialised occupation with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. The employer sponsors foreign workers from the fields of information technology, medicine and publication. The visa is granted for three years but can be extended to six years.\n\nAmerican and Indian tech companies \u2013 and a few consulting firms \u2013 dominate the scheme. Six of the top 10 beneficiaries of the scheme in 2024 were US companies, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), a nonpartisan think tank on trade and immigration: Amazon, Cognizant, IBM, Microsoft, Google and Meta. Three are Indian: Infosys, TCS and HCL. Capgemini, a French tech and consulting firm, rounds up the list.\n\nBut there is another, major new beneficiary of the scheme, per the NFAP\u2019s data: Musk\u2019s electric car giant Tesla. In 2024, Tesla won 742 new H-1B visas through the lottery, more than double the 328 it secured in 2023. In addition, Tesla had another 1,025 existing H-1B visas extended in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDue to data limitations, we don\u2019t have a good sense of the total H-1B visa holders currently in the US. However, as of 2019, close to 600,000 highly skilled immigrants worked in the US economy on H-1B visas. Approximately 120,000 immigrant workers received new H-1B visas in 2024,\u201d Batalova said.\n\nHowever, it isn\u2019t just MAGA advocates who are critical of the scheme.\n\nRonil Hira, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Howard University, said that the H-1B programme needs to be reformed. Problems plaguing the programme, he said, include the poor selection process, where \u201celigibility standards are too low, so the application lottery is flooded\u201d, and \u201cvisa winners are selected by lottery instead of rational criteria\u201d.\n\nWhat is the argument over H-1B visas?\n\nThe recent argument began when far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer criticised Trump\u2019s pick for artificial intelligence (AI) adviser, Sriram Krishnan, who has argued the US needs more foreign skilled workers to remain competitive in the technology industries.\n\nOn December 28, Musk threatened to \u201cgo to war\u201d on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,\u201d Musk posted.\n\nMusk was born in South Africa and previously held an H-1B visa before he became a naturalised US citizen.\n\nRamaswamy jumped on the debate, saying that technology companies hire foreign-born employees because of a difference in culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,\u201d he wrote, without mentioning the H-1B visa.\n\nBut he later clarified that the H-1B system \u201cis badly broken [and] should be replaced\u201d.\n\nBannon, who served under Trump\u2019s previous term, has called the H-1B programme a \u201ctotal scam\u201d as it allows tech companies to bring cheap labour from abroad at the cost of American workers. He has called for the deportation of H-1B visa holders as part of the wider deportation plans.\n\nHe railed particularly against Musk, saying the Tesla owner\u2019s \u201csole objective is to become a trillionaire. That\u2019s his objective,\u201d Bannon told the Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, on January 8\n\n\u201cHe will do anything related to make sure that any one of his companies is protected or has a better deal or he makes more money. His aggregation of wealth, and then \u2013 through wealth \u2013 power: that\u2019s what he\u2019s focused on. The American working people in this country are not going to tolerate it.\u201d\n\nBatalova explained that immigration has long been a contentious policy area in the US. There are \u201ctwo existential perspectives battling over the hearts and minds of the American public and voters\u201d, she said.\n\nShe elaborated that one perspective perceives immigrant workers, such as those on H-1B visas, as contributors to US economic power and global competitiveness. The other perspective views immigrant workers as competitors for jobs and limited economic resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBatalova added that this struggle has, at the moment, resurged and is \u201cfuelled in big part by voter discontent of how the government handled immigration after the COVID-19 pandemic, but also discussions about economic security and national competitiveness, particularly regarding China\u201d.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies and business groups continue to lobby for expanding the programme, arguing it is crucial for maintaining America\u2019s innovative edge. However, layoffs in the tech sector, combined with cases of worker replacement at various companies, have provided ammunition for H-1B critics.\u201d\n\nWho else has criticised the H-1B?\n\nCriticism of the H-1B visa has also come from the left.\n\nOn December 29, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told Fox News that the H-1B needs to be reformed.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t underpay these H-1B folks coming in,\u201d Khanna said. The programme \u201cshouldn\u2019t be for accountants or entry-level IT jobs. It should really be for exceptional talent. We should have that balance\u201d.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders has also criticised the H-1B visa programme. \u201cThe main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,\u201d he posted on X.\n\nElon Musk is wrong. The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire \u201cthe best and the brightest,\u201d but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make. pic.twitter.com/Mwz7i9TcSM \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 2, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho are the H-1B visa holders?\n\nAround 70 percent of H-1B visa recipients are from India and another 10 percent are from China.\n\nAs the debate rages in the US, some tech firms have withdrawn job offers to Indian workers, according to a report in the Indian newspaper, Times of India.\n\nBut India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs argued that H-1B visas benefit both countries.\n\n\u201cIndia-US economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value. We look forward to further deepening India-US economic ties, which are to our mutual benefit,\u201d Randhir Jaiswal, India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, said during a news conference on January 3.\n\nHas Trump softened on other immigration issues?\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign promises during the election comprised a hardline immigration policy. He has threatened to carry out mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and boost security at the border to prevent asylum seekers from entering the country.\n\nA month after he was voted in, he told NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker on a Meet the Press episode that he plans to end birthright citizenship in the US, a policy that has been in place for more than 150 years. The right is guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nHowever, during the interview, the president-elect said he was willing to work with Democrats to keep \u201cDreamers\u201d, undocumented people who arrived in the US as children and have lived in the country most of their lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to the H-1B visa in Trump\u2019s second term, \u201cno one knows what Trump will do. He did nothing in his first term even though he campaigned to reform the programme. It was a glaring unfulfilled promise\u201d, Hira, of Howard University, said.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans control Congress [both House and Senate] and the White House, so they have the power to change the programme for better or for worse, or keep the status quo. Will they exercise that power for change? Internal political calculations will dictate the direction they take.\u201d",

A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\n\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. We expect adjusted operating expenses to jump 8.1% in fiscal 2025. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and U.S. regions. Consumer spending growth is also drying up.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer responded to the plan, confirming that the government are happy to endorse it and take the recommendations forward.\n\nImmigration recommendations\n\nThe 21st recommendation set out in the report suggests that the UK government should \u2018explore how the existing immigration system can be used to attract graduates from universities producing some of the world\u2019s top AI talent\u2019.\n\nIt goes on to explain that some of the world\u2019s leading AI institutions, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University in the US are not currently included on the UK government\u2019s Global Universities List, making their graduates ineligible for the High Potential Individual visa.\n\nAs such, the report recommends that the government should take steps to develop new immigration pathways, and strengthen existing ones, to support these promising graduates. It should also explore how best to address wider barriers like the cost and complexity of visas which create obstacles for start-ups and deter overseas talent from relocating to the UK.\n\nIn its response, the government stated that it \u2018partially agrees\u2019 with recommendation 21, and that the Industrial Strategy will set out how the UK will attract highly skilled AI workers from abroad.\n\nIt argues that the UK already offers \u2018internationally competitive\u2019 visas that can support a range of individual needs, including for talent to join UK-based organisations or to start their own business.\n\nTop work visa routes for AI talent\n\nTalented AI professionals and graduates from institutions not on the HPI eligibility lists can enter the UK through other visa routes, including:\n\nThe Skilled Worker route \u2013 The most commonly used immigration route for foreign nationals seeking to work in the UK, a Skilled Worker visa may be granted if you have a confirmed job offer with a licensed UK sponsor.\n\nThe most commonly used immigration route for foreign nationals seeking to work in the UK, a Skilled Worker visa may be granted if you have a confirmed job offer with a licensed UK sponsor.

Smooth visa procedures are an essential part of our focus on the ease of doing business.\"\n\nThe BOI is the agency in charge of the screening of the applicants to the LTR program, which was first launched in September 2022, and offers successful applicant a 10-year residence, and access to a digital work permit, personal income tax privileges among other benefits. The LTR targets four categories, namely Highly-Skilled Professionals, Work-from-Thailand Professionals, Wealthy Global Citizens and Wealthy Pensioners.\n\nThe approved changes include an expansion of the list of target sectors for the Highly Skilled Professionals category, aimed at talent and experts. Previously focused on science, technology, and target industries, the list now encompasses a broader range of non-STEM fields, such as Development and sustainability, Disaster and risk management, Integrated innovation. The inclusion of educators in vocational and higher education across all disciplines will ensure the transfer of valuable knowledge to Thai students and professionals, and boost the nation's competitiveness.\n\nThe requirement for a minimum of five years of work experience in a relevant field for applicants to the Highly Skilled Professionals and Work-from-Thailand Professionals categories has been removed to reduce requirement redundancy and increase accessibility, allowing a wider range of high-potential applicants to contribute to Thailand's target industries.\n\nTwo other changes have been made to facilitate applications to the Work-from-Thailand Professionals category. The corporate revenue requirement for overseas-based employers sponsoring an applicant has been lowered to a minimum of USD 50 million over the last three years, down from USD 150 million. Also, employees of wholly owned subsidiaries of major multinational corporations are now eligible to the LTR, provided they can demonstrate financial stability through the parent company's financial statements, not the subsidiary as previously required. These changes reflect a commitment to attracting more digital and technology specialists, critical for Thailand's economic transformation.\n\nThe minimum annual income requirement for Wealthy Global Citizens category applicants has been removed to prioritize the cumulative wealth and investments in Thailand which are the core requirements for this category, aligning with the goal of encouraging greater foreign investment activity in the country.\n\nLast but not least, the rights for dependents of the principal applicant, to any of the four LTR categories have been expanded without a limitation on the number of dependents. The rights of the principal LTR holder will now include parents and legal dependents to enhance Thailand's appeal to families and ensure a welcoming and supportive environment for all.\n\nAll changes will take effect following the official BOI announcement on the updated LTR criteria and the Ministry of Interior's announcement on the expansion of dependents' rights.\n\nLTR Applications Data\n\nAs of the end of 2024, the BOI has already granted LTR visas to more than 6,000 applicants. Europe leads the list with 2,500 recipients, followed by the United States (1,080), Japan (610), China (340), and India (280).\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nThailand Board of Investment\n\nTel. +66 (0) 2553 8111\n\nWebsite: www.boi.go.th\n\nYouTube: Think Asia, Invest Thailand\n\nSOURCE Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)",

            "content": "Startup CTO Arun Prasad Jaganathan has been in the US for almost 14 years, mainly on an H-1B Visa.\n\nHe said the application process isn't easy and companies don't sponsor applicants to fill spaces.\n\nThe system has flaws, but there are misconceptions about H-1B employees contributing to the economy.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with\n\nArun Prasad Jaganathan, CTO of workforce platform Jugl. He is from Coimbatore, India, and now lives in Prosper, Texas. His identity, work experience, and visa status have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have been in the US for almost 14 years. I built most of my career here. I have my family here. I have my home here. So it would be tough for me to shift back to India and build something from there.\n\nI wanted to come to the US to experience the technology innovation firsthand. The US adapts technology faster than anywhere in the world.\n\nI completed my computer science and engineering degree in India and got an offshore position at global tech services company Cognizant. Eventually, they wanted me to come to New York because they felt like my presence in the US would help them build a better product and train them to scale their processes. So I came in on an L-1B visa, which is for an intra-company transfer to help on a project. Then, I applied for the H-1B Visa.\n\nH-1B is mainly for high-skilled workers. It helped me gain more product and business knowledge because it gave me first-hand experience working with US businesses.\n\nI'm in the process of acquiring permanent residency now, but the H1-B visa has helped me grow from my role at Cognizant to lead and architect at nThrive to managing advanced technology projects at KPMG. Now, I am leading technology and product for the startup Jugl.\n\nIt's not easy to get\n\nTo get the H-1B Visa, I needed to show a lot of documentation, including my degree, r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and job offer. I also needed a very good support letter from the client my company served, arguing the need for me to be placed in that location. The first time, I also had to go for an interview with a US Citizenship and Immigration Services officer once the documents were submitted.\n\nRelated stories\n\nEvery three years, you have to go through the same process. If there was no premium processing, which costs more, it took around three to six months to get my renewal. With premium processing, it takes about two weeks.\n\nUS Citizenship and Immigration Services scrutinizes every application. Companies don't hire H1-B talent just to fill spaces. They are very cautious about whom they sponsor for H-1B and they make sure that it's the top talent.\n\nThere are also regular audits from USCIS. They come and visit the companies and interview them. They audit employees. They ask questions to make sure they are placed in the same roles that they were submitted in the application.\n\nThe system has flaws \u2014 but there are misconceptions\n\nThe H-1B Visa system isn't perfect. However, I would not agree with the misconception I've heard that the H-1B visa is causing job losses. Any process will have loopholes, and they're working toward fixing them, but how fast they are going to do it is a question of the administration and other government functions.\n\nAnother argument is that H-1B employees don't contribute to the economy because they don't pay taxes. H-1 B employees pay taxes and insurance, have 401Ks and IRAs, and contribute back to the economy because they buy homes and cars and invest here in the US. I have a home, wife, and kids. I trained people already in the US. I helped them gain knowledge, build teams, develop products, and grow companies.\n\nUSCIS is making adjustments. The lottery system is little bit more difficult now because it's not just about skill level, it's more about luck. Now, because there is a lottery system, people with better skills might be frustrated.\n\nIn the last couple of years, many people were applying through different companies for a higher chance of getting picked in the H-1B lottery. USCIS understood this was happening, so they updated their system.\n\nThere is still room for improvement. For example, USCIS increased wages H-1B employees have to make and also increased sponsorship fees. The downside to it is companies have less incentive to hire.\n\nWith the startup I work for now, if we cannot find the talent we are looking for in the US, we have to hire H-1B candidates. But at the early stages of startup, it is a higher cost for us to hire H-1B workers. The H-1B process involves paying the attorney and legal fees as overhead, in addition to the high salary we need to pay compared to local talent.\n\nNow other countries are catching up, like China and India. If H-1B is becoming tougher for workers they're going to open startups where they can build those products. Or, multinational corporates are going to open centers in locations where they can find people like in India, Mexico, Canada, and many other places.",

As the title of this piece indicates, there was some movement in two India categories \u2013 under 3 weeks in EB-2 and only 1 week in EB-3 \u2013 but we\u2019ll take it.\n\nBelow is a summary that includes Final Action Dates and changes from the previous month, but first \u2013 some background if you\u2019re new to these blog posts. If you\u2019re an old hand at the Visa Bulletin, feel free to skip the next paragraph.\n\nThe Visa Bulletin is released monthly by the US Department of State (in collaboration with US Citizenship and Immigration Services). If your priority date (that is, the date you got a place on the waiting list) is earlier than the cutoff date listed in the Bulletin for your nationality and category, that means a visa number is available for you that month. That, in turn, means you can submit your DS-260 immigrant visa application (if you\u2019re applying at a US embassy abroad) or your I-485 adjustment of status application (if you\u2019re applying with USCIS). If you already submitted that final step and your category then retrogressed, it means the embassy or USCIS can now approve your application because a visa number is again available.\n\nNow for the January VB \u2013\n\nIndia continues to make slow progress in most categories:\n\nEB-1 holds at February 1, 2022\n\nEB-2 advances 2 months to October 1, 2012\n\n2 months to October 1, 2012 EB-3 Professionals and EB-3 Other Workers advance 1 month to December 1, 2012\n\nChina also made some gains:\n\nEB-1 freezes at November 8, 2022\n\nEB-2 advances 1 month to April 22, 2020\n\n1 month to April 22, 2020 EB-3 Professionals advances 2 months to June 1, 2020\n\n2 months to June 1, 2020 EB-3 Other Workers stalls at January 1, 2017\n\nAll Other Countries also saw incremental progress:\n\nEB-1 remains current\n\nEB-2 advances 17 days to April 1, 2023\n\n17 days to April 1, 2023 EB-3 Professionals advances 16 days to December 1, 2022\n\n16 days to December 1, 2022 EB-3 Other Workers advances 1 week to December 8, 2020\n\nNOTE 1: USCIS will accept I-485 applications in January based on the Department of State\u2019s more favorable Dates for Filing chart, which allows from 2 months to 1 year of additional filing time depending on nationality and category. These dates have not moved since December.\n\nChinese nationals gain almost 2 months to file in EB\u20111; a little over 5 months in EB-2; 5.5 months in EB\u20113 Professionals; and 1 year in EB-3 Other Workers.\n\nIndian nationals gain 2.5 months in EB-1; 3 months in EB-2; and a little over 6 months in EB-3 Professionals and EB-3 Other Workers.\n\nNationals of all other countries may file their I-485s in advance of their priority dates being current by 4 months in EB-2; 3 months in EB-3 Professionals; and 5.5 months in EB-3 Other Workers.\n\nNOTE 2: The Dates for Filing chart applies only to I-485 applications with USCIS.

Does it matter which one you choose when deciding on a credit card?\n\nWe\u2019ll take a closer look at Visa, how it compares with Mastercard and common credit card terms that are helpful to know if you\u2019re getting started with credit cards.\n\nWhat is Visa?\n\nPut simply, Visa is a payment network. When you buy something with a Visa card, Visa processes the payment, instantly communicating with your bank so the merchant gets paid. This happens whenever you swipe your card, regardless of whether you\u2019re shopping in person, or on your laptop, tablet or cellphone.\n\nMastercard, American Express and Discover are also payment networks, but Visa and Mastercard are the most widely accepted networks. In fact, Visa processes 61% of transactions in the U.S., far outpacing any other network.\n\nWhat is the history of Visa?\n\nVisa\u2019s operations began in 1958 when Bank of America launched the BankAmericard\u00ae credit card. It was the first consumer credit card program, and it brought the company great success, allowing it to expand operations internationally in 1974. In 1976, BankAmericard became Visa \u2014 a name that sounded the same in all languages.\n\nVisa continued to grow as regional businesses around the world merged to form Visa, Inc. in 2007. A year later, it went public in one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPO) in history. Today, Visa operates in more than 200 countries and territories, with the mission to \u201cuplift everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid.\u201d\n\nOf course, those who are shopping for a credit card often prefer one that\u2019s widely accepted. The more Visa dominates the global payment network industry, the more it attracts new merchants and, by extension, customers.\n\nHow does a payment network differ from a card issuer?\n\nDespite Visa\u2019s popularity, there\u2019s often confusion around what a Visa card\u2019s role is when it comes to credit card benefits.\n\nAmerican Express and Discover, for example, serve as both the payment network and credit card issuer. However, unlike American Express and Discover, Visa does not issue credit cards. It is solely a payment network.\n\nInstead, financial institutions, such as Chase, Capital One and Wells Fargo, issue credit cards \u2014 and Visa serves as the communication line that allows payment transactions to be processed.\n\nStar Icon Keep in mind: A credit card issuer, not the payment network, administers rewards programs and credit card perks, and determines borrowing terms like interest rates and fees.\n\nVisa vs. Mastercard\n\nIn practice, Mastercard is almost as widely accepted as Visa worldwide. But both payment networks offer additional benefits to credit card members just for being a part of their network, and that\u2019s how Visa and Mastercard differ.\n\nGenerally, Visa\u2019s benefits are more focused on travel and protection, while Mastercard focuses more on discounts and promotions.\n\nVisa benefits\n\nVisa offers three main tiers of benefits: Traditional, Signature and Infinite.\n\nTraditional: Includes zero fraud liability, emergency card replacement and cash disbursement and emergency roadside service.\n\nIncludes zero fraud liability, emergency card replacement and cash disbursement and emergency roadside service. Signature: Includes all of the Traditional benefits, plus 24-hour travel and emergency assistance.\n\nIncludes all of the Traditional benefits, plus 24-hour travel and emergency assistance. Infinite: Includes all the other tier benefits, as well as travel accident protection, trip cancellation and interruption protection, trip delay reimbursement, lost luggage coverage (up to $3,000 per trip or $2,000 per bag if you live in New York), an auto rental collision damage waiver, return protections and purchase protections.\n\nMastercard benefits\n\nMastercard also offers three main tiers of benefits: Standard, World and World Elite.\n\nStandard: Includes emergency card assistance and replacement, zero fraud liability and identity theft protection.\n\nIncludes emergency card assistance and replacement, zero fraud liability and identity theft protection. World: Includes Standard benefits, plus trip planning, travel upgrades, concierge service and numerous discounts and promotions.\n\nIncludes Standard benefits, plus trip planning, travel upgrades, concierge service and numerous discounts and promotions. World Elite: Includes all the previous benefits, along with exclusive offers and more discounts and promotions. Current promotions are the same as the World promotions, plus access to exclusive PGA Tour experiences and VIP travel experiences (like cooking classes abroad, tours or personal shopping services).\n\nTypes of Visa cards\n\nVisa cards \u2014 those branded with the Visa logo that use the Visa processing network \u2014 come in a few different versions:\n\nDebit cards: These are usually linked to a checking account and issued by your bank. When you swipe it at the point of sale, the money instantly comes out of your account.\n\nThese are usually linked to a checking account and issued by your bank.

Credit cards: Banks also issue credit cards, and they typically come with many more consumer benefits and protections, such as zero fraud liability and transaction monitoring. Others come with extra perks like rewards and purchase protections.

            "content": "Navigating the Future of H-1B, L-1 and O-1 Visas\n\nAs the new Trump administration takes shape, tech companies and foreign workers are keenly observing potential changes to the H-1B visa program and other related tech visas. The administration is expected to appease its opposing stakeholders by maintaining strong relationships with the tech industry while also addressing concerns from those advocating for stricter immigration policies.\n\nH-1B and L-1 Visas: A Balancing Act\n\nWhile some factions within the administration may push for a reduction in high-skilled immigration, the administration\u2019s close ties with tech companies suggests it will likely maintain current levels of H-1B and L-1 visa issuances. The tech industry heavily relies on these visas, and any drastic reduction could disrupt business operations and innovation. However, procedural changes that we saw in the previous administration, as well as new ones, might be introduced to indirectly limit access, such as increased scrutiny during adjudications, slower processing times, increased requests for evidence, higher denial rates, and more frequent site visits.\n\nA particular focus is expected on third-party placement firms and staffing companies, which have been accused of misusing the H-1B program. Companies that are in the outsourcing/staffing industry may face heightened scrutiny and additional requirements, especially in terms of documenting third-party worksite placements.\n\nBuy American, Hire American: Implications and Expectations\n\nThe anticipated \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order could lead to reviews of companies using large numbers of H-1B visas to determine if they are prioritizing foreign workers over U.S. citizens. This may also involve increased activity from the Department of Justice\u2019s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER), which scrutinizes whether foreign nationals are being unfairly preferred in hiring.\n\nGeopolitical Considerations and Security Checks\n\nThe administration might impose stricter limitations on H-1B visa holders from countries perceived as unfriendly, such as China and those countries that have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Enhanced security and administrative checks could lead to delays for nationals from these countries, reflecting broader geopolitical concerns. The administration could also bring back its Travel Bans via executive orders, as it did previously.\n\nPotential Revisions to Existing Policies\n\nThere is speculation about reversing USCIS\u2019s deference policy, which has allowed USCIS adjudicators to rely on prior approvals involving the same parties and facts rather that adjudicating every visa petition from scratch. While the recent H-1B modernization rule codifies the deference policy, the administration could issue directives requiring case-by-case reviews, potentially complicating and slowing the process for employers and applicants.\n\nAdditionally, work authorization for some spouses of tech workers may disappear. The Trump administration proposed eliminating the H-4 EAD in 2021 and it may try to do this again. There have been no similar attempts at, or discussions around, rescinding L-2 work authorization.\n\nOptional Practical Training (OPT) and STEM OPT\n\nPrevious attempts by the Trump administration to limit OPT and STEM OPT were met with resistance from the tech industry and educational institutions. Further restrictions on these programs seem unlikely in the short term because any changes would likely face significant pushback due to their importance to tech companies and universities.\n\nPrevailing Wage and Union Advocacy\n\nEfforts to increase prevailing wages for H-1B workers may gain traction, with heightened scrutiny on companies accused of undercutting wages through foreign hires. The incoming head of the Department of Labor could advocate for policies that favor higher prevailing wages and address union concerns.\n\nConclusion: Navigating Uncertainty\n\nWhile the new administration may introduce challenges for high-skilled immigration, the business community\u2019s pushback and the economic benefits of these programs could help prevent implementation of any drastic measures. Companies and foreign workers should stay informed and prepare for potential procedural changes.",

            "content": "(Photo illustration by Bruno Rouby/Yahoo Sports)\n\nThe 6 million fans will come from Asia and Latin America, from Africa and Europe, from all across the globe. The 2026 men\u2019s World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will \u201cwelcome\u201d them; it will be \u201cthe greatest spectacle of celebration and inclusivity,\u201d FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said, and \u201cthe biggest, best and most inclusive FIFA World Cup ever.\u201d\n\nWith 17 months until kickoff, however, it is dogged by festering concerns that some of those millions won\u2019t be allowed to enter the United States \u2014 because they won\u2019t be able to get U.S. visas.\n\nFans, World Cup organizers, politicians and other stakeholders are worried that stringent immigration laws and \u201cunacceptably high\u201d visa wait times will hinder certain segments of supporters, and cloud FIFA\u2019s promise of an \u201cinclusive,\u201d welcoming event.\n\nMany of those supporters from non-European countries will need to interview for a visa; but, per January 2025 estimates, the wait for interviews at U.S. embassies or consulates in Colombia, or Nigeria, or India would stretch beyond 300 days.\n\nThe Department of State, which manages visa processing, has pledged to lower those wait times. Barring a late policy change, though, it will not treat soccer fans preferentially. Whereas previous World Cup hosts, such as Russia and Qatar, designed processes to fast-track ticket-holders into their countries, the U.S. government has no such plans.\n\nAnd so, the concerns \u2014 which also pertain to the 2025 Club World Cup and 2028 Olympics \u2014 linger. Some government officials argue they\u2019re overblown, because millions of fans will qualify for waivers or already have U.S. visas. But still, experts say, concern could crescendo under incoming President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly vowed to crack down on immigration and \u201cseal up those borders.\u201d Even if Trump seizes upon the World Cup as an instrument of soft power, and grants FIFA favorable treatment, fast-tracking fans to U.S. shores likely won\u2019t be a top priority.\n\n\u201cThere's just not a good way, and a limited amount of time, to differentiate between the millions of people who are applying for a visa to come into the United States \u2014 for business reasons, for visiting family, or for the purposes of staying long term \u2014 and people who are just coming for the [World Cup],\u201d Travis Murphy, a former State Department officer and now the CEO of Jetr Global, a sports immigration consultancy, told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI have to assume that wait times will go up, that immigration restrictions will be tightened. And as such, the fans \u2014 that could continue to be an issue.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. visa process\n\nUnderpinning the issue, which will disproportionately affect fans from Latin America and Africa, is a visa process that\u2019s complicated and time-consuming.\n\nThe U.S. welcomes tens of millions of visitors annually; but it doesn\u2019t just welcome anyone. U.S. law requires most foreigners to \u201cestablish\u201d that they have \u201cno intention of abandoning\u201d their native country; that they\u2019re \u201cvisiting the United States temporarily,\u201d rather than intending to immigrate.\n\nSo, to secure a \u201cB\u201d visitor visa, they must first fill out the DS-160, an online form that \u201ctakes approximately 90 minutes\u201d to complete, per the State Department. They must submit documentation and personal details; education and work histories; their U.S. itinerary, if they have one; their history of international travel, and more. They must do it all in English, then pay a $185 application fee and schedule an in-person appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate. There, they must submit fingerprints and convince an interviewing officer that they won\u2019t use this \u201cnonimmigrant visa\u201d to stay in the U.S. permanently.\n\n\u201cThe basis of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d says Julie Stufft, the State Department\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for visa services, is \u201caccepting people for their willingness to go back to their home country when they're done with their trip.\u201d\n\nFrom October 2022 to September 2023 (FY2023), the State Department accepted 5.9 million applicants for \u201cB\u201d visitor visas; it denied 1.8 million. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can reject a would-be visitor. Those with a criminal history, without proof of previous travel, without stable income, or without strong ties to home are more likely to be denied by either DHS or, primarily, State.\n\nAll of those criteria lead experts to believe that a minority of fans who plan travel to the 2026 World Cup could be refused entry to the U.S., which will host 78 of the 104 matches. \u201cIf they don't have any sort of [travel history], and they're seeking for this to be their first international trip, it's going to be very difficult to obtain a visa,\u201d Murphy says.\n\nAnd for some, it could be difficult to even land an interview.\n\nU.S. visa wait times\n\nNone of the above will apply to the citizens of 43 countries \u2014 most of Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, Israel, Qatar and a few more \u2014 who qualify for the Visa Waiver Program. The vast majority of fans from those countries, which should comprise roughly half the 2026 World Cup field, will be allowed to travel with an electronic authorization, and won\u2019t need to navigate the intensive visa application process.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, should be able to score an interview. Wait times aren\u2019t universally long. In Argentina, Brazil, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, they\u2019re less than 50 days.\n\nIn Colombia, though, the wait is 700 days. In Turkey, it\u2019s 560. In Ecuador, Morocco, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Honduras, Costa Rica, Mexico and elsewhere, it\u2019s more than 200. In Iran, Venezuela and a few other potential World Cup nations, there is no operating U.S. embassy, and visa applicants must go through a consulate or embassy abroad.\n\nThe wait times, which are among the highest in the world, could foil or deter thousands of fans who\u2019d otherwise plan a World Cup trip \u2014 either to attend matches, or to simply partake in the surrounding party.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino has promised that the 2026 World Cup will be the most inclusive ever, but U.S. visa hurdles may complicate that vision. (Eva Marie Uzcategui/FIFA via Getty Images)\n\nIn response to this concern, the State Department\u2019s primary message to fans has been to \u201capply early.\u201d Stufft, the visa services deputy, told Yahoo Sports in an October interview: \u201cIf you think you might be coming to the World Cup, either as a ticketed guest or somebody who wants to be adjacent to the activities, apply now.\u201d FIFA has echoed and amplified that advice. \u201cFans can apply for visas at any time to start the process,\u201d a spokesman told Yahoo Sports in an emailed statement, \u201cand they do not need to wait for a ticket.\u201d\n\nTo many, though, the advice is unsatisfactory. No nations have qualified yet; no tickets are available. Relatively few fans will pay $185 for the chance to get a visa, and for the chance to get a (potentially very expensive) ticket to a World Cup match between unknown teams.\n\nThe vast majority who need to apply, therefore, will probably do so between the fall of 2025 \u2014 when most teams will qualify, and when tickets will go on sale \u2014 and the spring of 2026.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s task will be to meet that surging demand.\n\nWhy the U.S. won\u2019t give the World Cup special treatment\n\nThe creation of a special, World Cup-specific visa circulated as an idea within FIFA and the U.S. government, multiple people familiar with the discussions told Yahoo Sports. Organizers of the Los Angeles Olympics have pushed for something similar in 2028, \u00e0 la Paris 2024.\n\nSuch a system, though, would likely apply only to \u201caccredited individuals\u201d \u2014 athletes, coaches, staff, administrators; and perhaps media, commercial partners, volunteers and stadium workers.\n\nOpening it to fans \u2014 or waiving the visa requirement, as Russia did in 2018 with its \u201cFan ID\u201d system \u2014 was always considered unlikely in the world\u2019s wealthiest country, where, unlike in Russia or Qatar, there is suspicion that foreigners would use the World Cup as a false pretense to immigrate. (Of the 9.8 million people from non-North American, non-Visa Waiver Program countries who entered the U.S. as visitors and were expected to depart in FY2023, a suspected 298,560 \u2014 around 3% \u2014 overstayed their \u201cB\u201d visas and remained in the country, per DHS data.)\n\nAnd what about allowing fans to skip the monthslong lines for visa interviews, which could leave them waiting until after the World Cup is over?\n\nThat, as one person close to the issue said, wouldn\u2019t be fair to the \u201cpeople that miss weddings, that miss funerals, that miss important opportunities professionally, that don't get to school on time and therefore lose out on scholarships,\u201d all while waiting on visas. \u201cThere's no shortage of people with urgent need to travel to the United States for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that aren't being allowed to go to the front of the line.\u201d\n\nPlus, one government official reasoned to Yahoo Sports, it would rankle Disney and hundreds of other companies or events that also attract tourists but don\u2019t get preferential treatment.\n\n\u201cThere's a general mentality within the State Department,\u201d Murphy says, \u201cthat all applicants are treated equal.\u201d\n\nAnd so, \u201cOur goal,\u201d Stufft said, \u201cis to use our existing process \u2026 to make sure that anybody who wants to visit the U.S. gets a visa interview that matches their own travel plans.\u201d\n\nBesides, the creation of a special visa would probably require new legislation. A bill would have to trudge through the labyrinth of Congress, at a time when the legislative priority is to tighten border security, not loosen it. Even if one were conceived, introduced, passed and signed into law, \u201cfor the World Cup, I think that's too late,\" Tiffany Derentz, a former State Department official and current senior counsel at immigration law firm BAL, told Yahoo Sports. Implementation might require technology. \u201cAnything involving technology, and changes to an existing system,\u201d Derentz explained, \u201care just a lot harder than it might seem to implement, and take time. Because it has to hit on a number of different systems, and across a number of different agencies.\u201d\n\nSo, in talks with DHS and the State Department, FIFA has focused on operating within current boundaries. Soccer's global governing body, in addition to sorting through visa processes for World Cup participants, has urged the State Department to address the wait times for fans, multiple people involved in the discussions told Yahoo Sports. The hope is that State will hustle resources and personnel to countries who\u2019ll qualify for the World Cup. It is already \u201csending temporary additional staff to Colombia and extending operating hours,\u201d a State Department spokesman told Yahoo Sports. \u201cTourists and business travelers should see appointment availability increase and wait times fall in the coming months.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's return to office has raised concerns about stricter immigration policies that could impact fan attendance at the 2026 World Cup. (Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTrump\u2019s impact\n\nThe wait times largely stem from the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201cwhich made it so difficult for our embassies and consulates around the world to issue visas,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Then, as tourism rebounded post-pandemic, the State Department struggled to keep pace with pent-up, unprecedented demand. It is now processing record numbers of applicants \u2014 12.9 million nonimmigrants in 2023 \u2014 but knows it must do more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to ramp up our capacity to make sure that everyone who\u2019s coming to this country, for these [sporting] events as well as for so much else, get their visas in a timely way and smooth way,\u201d Blinken said in October.\n\nOn Monday, though, a new administration will take charge, one that \u201cwas not particularly friendly to immigrants and foreign nationals previously,\u201d Derentz says. \u201cSo there is a lot of concern there with how the incoming [Trump] administration will handle [World Cup] visitors while maintaining the appearance of keeping their immigration agenda \u2014 which is likely going to include travel bans, and create significant hurdles to obtain a visa.\u201d\n\nTrump, amid similar concerns in 2018, when the U.S., Canada and Mexico were bidding for this World Cup, signed a letter to Infantino that stated, in part: \u201cI am confident \u2026 that all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.\u201d\n\nAlso in his first term, though, Trump suspended some visa interview waivers, and amended a President Barack Obama executive order to remove a command that \u201c80 percent of nonimmigrant visa applicants [should be] interviewed within 3 weeks of receipt of application.\u201d\n\nSimilar moves eight years later could, experts say, further complicate World Cup travel. \u201cThere's potential [to] start seeing wait times going back up instead of down,\u201d Derentz says, and \u201cslower processing overall, and greater scrutiny.\u201d\n\nWill players struggle to get visas?\n\nThere is significantly less concern that the stringent system will impact players or coaches, like it did athletes at the 2022 world track and field championships and various lesser-known teams over the years. \u201cI don't lose any sleep over that,\u201d Stufft said. \u201cWe work with FIFA directly from my office on almost a daily basis. So, we will be sure to know who needs to be here for work. That part we'll get right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur agreement with FIFA is that we have expeditious processing for anyone who is involved with the games themselves,\u201d she added. But she couldn\u2019t say who, exactly, would be considered \u201cinvolved.\u201d Players will, but how far will the \u201cexpeditious processing\u201d extend? To journalists? To sponsor reps? To vendors?\n\nMultiple people familiar with the planning said some of that is still undecided.\n\n\u201cThere's been a lot of conversation that accredited individuals and teams will be fine, they'll be prioritized,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cBut how that will actually work has not been outlined in any way, nor communicated to individual embassies.\u201d\n\nThere are also gray areas between visa categories, and unanswered questions about how some of the 500,000-plus people that FIFA plans to credential will get clearance to come. Like fans, many will need to get it in early 2026. \u201cAnd so,\u201d Derentz says, \u201cyou have thousands and thousands and thousands of travelers all around the world trying to get through a process at the same time.\u201d\n\nWhether they\u2019ll get through without hiccups remains to be seen. The 2026 World Cup will be the first mega sporting event that the U.S. has hosted since the 2002 Winter Olympics \u2014 before DHS was established, and security was strengthened, in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nSo there is no applicable precedent. At earlier planning stages, according to multiple people familiar with the process, many within the U.S. government didn\u2019t grasp the scope and global significance of the World Cup; some held up smaller, less prestigious events, such as cricket\u2019s T20 World Cup or other soccer tournaments, as evidence the U.S. was prepared for 2026.\n\nNow, there is at least a better understanding of the magnitude. How that will translate to policy, or to visa decisions, is the big unknown.\n\nFIFA, in its emailed statement, said that its 2026 World Cup subsidiary is \u201cworking with the State Department to ensure those individuals involved in staging the event have a streamlined visa process, which includes educating State Department officials on the roles that are necessary for a successful World Cup.\u201d",

            "content": "Republicans are feuding over how many people can obtain H-1B visas, permits that allow foreign professionals to legally work in the United States. Today an estimated 600,000 foreigners with H-1B visas have tech, academic, medical and other jobs.\n\nTwo of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s most influential \u2013 yet informal \u2013 advisers, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, want to expand the program to help Silicon Valley\u2019s tech companies recruit what they call \u201cexcellent engineering talent.\u201d Other conservatives with strong Trump ties, such as Steve Bannon and Laura Loomer, see this immigration program as a \u201cscam\u201d and a cheap labor program as pernicious as \u201cillegal immigration.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump, who previously criticized the program, has sided with Musk and Ramaswamy so far, based on my research I doubt the conflict between the sparring GOP camps will go away anytime soon.\n\nI am a public law scholar who studies the history of foreign workers in America. In the book I\u2019m now writing, I describe the long-standing conflict between employers and workers over granting foreigners permission to work in the U.S. That struggle has yielded both compromises and new layers of bureaucracy for more than 100 years.\n\nSwinging the gates shut \u2212 then open a crack\n\nThe fight over the employment of foreign labor began in the late 19th century when Congress passed several laws to stop labor migration in response to pressure from American workers.\n\nThese restrictions further hardened with the passage of the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924. That law tightly curtailed immigration on the basis of national origins quotas. Employers in need of foreign labor began to ask the Bureau of Immigration, an agency that eventually became the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, for exceptions to the new restrictions.\n\nEmployers also lobbied for foreign temporary workers as a legal loophole.\n\nThe biggest early example of their success was the Bracero program. From 1942 to 1964, about 4 million Mexican men got jobs as farmworkers in California and other Western states. They were given the right to legally stay in the country on short-term, renewable contracts.\n\nSince then, farmers, labor unions and civil rights groups have been fighting over the rules protecting American labor under the H-2 visa, which Congress established on behalf of farmers and other employers in 1952 \u2013 generally replacing the Bracero program.\n\nAlthough the government now issues most H-1Bs to temporary migrants with tech jobs, the visa\u2019s origins date back to the days before computers.\n\nThe Bureau of Immigration, the government agency responsible for issuing permits at the time, often approved employer requests after the Johnson-Reed Act\u2019s passage. But organized labor tended to object.\n\nIn 1932, for example, the American Federation of Musicians persuaded Congress to impose limits on these ad hoc permits under the Musicians Immigration Clarification Act. Only artists of \u201cdistinguished merit and ability\u201d \u2013 like the famous Austrian violin virtuoso Fritz Kreisler \u2013 received visas reserved for accomplished and creative foreigners.\n\nIn the 1930s, Ford Motor Co. also asked for authorization to hire engineers from abroad. The Boston Symphony Orchestra wanted to hire foreign musicians. Hollywood sought exemptions so it could scout abroad for actors such as Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo.\n\nStandards for foreign professionsals\n\nIn 1952, Congress borrowed the \u201cdistinguished merit and ability\u201d standard to restrict the new H-1 visa to professionals with global reputations in sports, the arts and the sciences. Lawmakers also ensured that each permit would be valid only for a single year.\n\nThe one-year limit and \u201cdistinguished merit and ability\u201d standard kept the number of foreign workers with H-1 visas low until 1969.\n\nThe numbers shot up after employer groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Foreign Trade Council, lobbied Congress and the agency by then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service to loosen the rules.\n\nExtending their stay\n\nThe federal government obliged by extending the visa limit to three years and loosening H-1 requirements in the early 1970s. A bachelor\u2019s degree would from then on suffice as evidence of \u201cdistinguished merit.\u201d But by 1989, employer groups decided that they wanted even more flexibility in the law.\n\nCongress accommodated them by creating the \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d requirement, which does not require a bachelor\u2019s degree, leading to the advent of the H-1B visa. About one-third of the people whose H-1B applications were approved in 2023 didn\u2019t have a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree.\n\nLawmakers also further loosened the rules by allowing H-1B workers to extend their visas to six years or more and to apply for permanent residency while in temporary status.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, an umbrella group that most U.S. unions belong to, sought to make it harder to obtain the new visa to limit its potential harm to U.S. workers. It wanted the government to adopt a mandate that employers first attempt to recruit Americans. The AFL-CIO also lobbied for new wage requirements subject to Department of Labor enforcement.\n\nBusiness groups objected to what they saw as excessive red tape and costly paperwork, calling for \u201cmore flexibility and less restrictions.\u201d\n\nThe government reached a compromise between organized labor and employers in 1990. Congress dropped the AFL-CIO\u2019s request that employers recruit Americans before H-1Bs, but it set a yearly cap on the number of visas issued \u2013 initially 65,000 \u2013 and a minimum wage for workers with this kind of visa.\n\nMore tensions with Big Tech\n\nAfter 2000, Congress continued to fine-tune this equilibrium between the demands made by U.S. workers and their employers. Business got higher caps, while universities and nonprofits received a permanent exemption from them. Organized labor pushed for and won new protections enforceable by the Department of Labor.\n\nTo many unions and other groups representing workers, however, this was not enough.\n\nAs the number of people with H-1B visas employed at one time climbed to nearly 600,000 in 2009, unions\u2019 objections reached a fever pitch.\n\nImmigration reform efforts of all kinds had stalled in Congress. This meant proposed H-1B reforms, such as the mandate that employers recruit Americans first, went nowhere.\n\nThe fight, which now pitted Big Tech against the old left and the increasingly loud anti-immigrant right, moved to the White House. The Obama and Trump administrations imposed new limits on foreign labor contractors. Industry groups sued in federal courts, with some success, to block those restrictions.\n\nFor example, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated a Trump administration policy that required each employer petition to include every work contract an H-1B worker would have over a three-year period. The idea behind the policy had been to make it virtually impossible for foreign labor contractors to obtain H-1B visas. Trade associations representing information technology services companies prevailed in this case.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced new guidelines in December 2024 that mostly maintained the status quo.\n\nI suspect that Congress will revisit the H-1B visa again. When it does, if history is any guide, lawmakers will set higher caps on the number of visas available, pegged to more stringent regulations.",

The decision comes after the Senators introduced legislation in March 2023 that would have granted Romania eligibility within the U.S. visa waiver program.\n\n\u201cIn the three decades since the fall of one of the most brutal of Communist regimes, Romania has made remarkable progress establishing a democratic, market-based system and has become a valued partner in NATO and the EU,\u201d said Ranking Member Shaheen. \u201cCongratulations to Romania on this achievement that will further deepen the strong bonds between our two nations, finally realizing the objective of our Romania Visa Waiver Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Shaheen and I introduced legislation in 2023 with the hopes that Romania would be granted eligibility within the U.S. visa waiver program,\u201d said Senator Durbin. \u201cI am heartened that DHS and the State Department has added Romania to this program, strengthening our ties with this nation that emerged from the ashes of Soviet tyranny to become a thriving member of the transatlantic community of democracies, NATO and the EU.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Shaheen and Durbin traveled to Georgia and Romania where they met with heads of state, members of the parliament, and representatives from civil society to discuss the nations\u2019 bilateral relationship, as well as the geopolitical importance of the Black Sea region. While in Romania, the Senators met with U.S. soldiers from the 101st Airborne and with Romanian Prime Minister Ciuca, who reiterated the threat of Russian aggression and Romania\u2019s proud role in the larger battle for democracy and freedom. Prime Minister Ciuca also raised the threat Putin poses to the neighboring democracy of Moldova, where Russia already occupies a piece of its territory. The trip followed the 2023 Munich Security Conference.\n\n###",

            "content": "Approval of U.S. visas\u2014which has historically been up to federal officials in Washington\u2014could soon be put in the hands of state attorneys general, creating immense uncertainty for colleges, universities and the international students and scholars they serve.\n\nIt all depends on whether the Senate passes the Laken Riley Act, an immigration measure that Republicans have championed as one of their first actions of the new 119th Congress.\n\nNamed after an Augusta University nursing student who was murdered in Athens, Ga., early last year by an undocumented migrant with a criminal record, the bill\u2019s primary aim is to introduce harsher detention policies. But another section of the legislation that has largely flown under the radar could impact visas for lawful, documented individuals applying to work or study in the States.\n\nThis particular provision of the eight-page bill would expand the power of state appointees, allowing them to sue the federal government and seek sweeping bans on visas from countries that won\u2019t take back deportees. This includes countries such as Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador that are south of the U.S. border and frequently a part of immigration debates, but it could also apply to countries like China and India, which colleges often depend on for large swaths of their international student population.\n\nThe bill swept through the House last week with support from 216 Republicans and 48 Democrats. Now, as the Senate resumes consideration, policy experts say it\u2019s possible that enough Democrats will back the bill to help it clear the more difficult 60-vote threshold.\n\nAll but nine Senate Democrats joined the Republicans in advancing the Laken Riley Act to debate on Thursday. Senators John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Ruben Gallego of Arizona, both Democrats, co-sponsored the Senate version of the bill, and Senators Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Jacky Rosen of Nevada indicated they would vote yes.\n\nFetterman told The Washington Post that while he \u201cnever suggested that it necessarily is a perfect bill,\u201d it is \u201cnecessary.\u201d When asked what he made of other Democrats choosing to consider the bill, he said, \u201cIt was a blinding flash of common sense.\u201d\n\nThe bill was heard on the Senate floor Monday afternoon and could possibly receive a vote before President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration Jan. 20. If all six continue to support the bill, only one more Democrat would have to back the bill in order to send it to the president\u2019s desk.\n\nSome higher education policy experts told Inside Higher Ed that they were unfamiliar with the bill and only started following it in recent days. But Miriam Feldblum, co-founder and executive director of the Presidents\u2019 Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, said college and university leaders should absolutely be concerned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about loss of talent, loss of enrollment, loss of financial revenue contribution, not only for the campus, but for the community,\u201d she said. \u201cThis may not have been fully understood when the bill was formulated, and for those who may be supporting different components of the bill, it\u2019s important to recognize what these provisions could really implicate.\u201d\n\nHow Would It Impact Higher Ed?\n\nBy enabling state attorneys general to file lawsuits not only about the handling of one individual deportee but also all visa applicants, the bill\u2019s impact instantly becomes rather broad and can inadvertently harm the success of colleges and industry groups, Feldblum said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need for talent from specific countries such as China and India. We\u2019re bringing in nonimmigrant professionals on H-1B [visas], or students on F-1s, or immigrant visa holders who are coming in to join family members,\u201d she said. \u201cThose individuals who are coming in legally through established processes should not be harmed.\u201d\n\nBut if the bill passes as it stands, it very well could affect those individuals as well as institutions that enroll a high proportion of international students, she said. The legislation could also make it more difficult for families of existing students or scholars to access visas, deterring them from continuing to teach or research in the States.\n\nRepublicans who introduced the bill, however, seem to be less focused on the bill\u2019s broader potential impacts and more on the acute issue of seeking justice for the Riley family.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s open-border policies have had a devastating impact on too many American families,\u201d Senator John Boozman of Arkansas said in a news release introducing the bill. \u201cLaken Riley\u2019s loved ones now face that reality daily, coping with her unimaginable loss. This bipartisan, commonsense legislation to safeguard our communities by requiring ICE to arrest illegal immigrants who have committed crimes can help spare future victims and uphold the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe legislation is likely to be challenged in court as unconstitutional, since immigration oversight has historically been deemed a federal authority. But up until a state attorney general takes action and the first case makes its way through the court system, Feldblum says, the bill could still cause a significant chilling effect.\n\n\u201cIt sends a message. If this is something that a state attorney general can do \u2026 it really creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty and anxiety among all international students,\u201d she said.\n\nWill the Bill Become Law?\n\nIf the bill makes it to the White House in its current form, President-elect Donald Trump would likely sign it into law when he takes office. The incoming executive has repeatedly blasted the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies and blamed them for Riley\u2019s death at a campaign rally in March.\n\nBut Feldblum noted that parts of the bill are at odds with Trump\u2019s increasing emphasis on ensuring that what immigration does occur legally promotes the introduction of skilled workers.\n\n\u201cThe provisions we\u2019ve been talking about are at odds with the goal to support, recruit, retain global talent and bolster national security and economic prosperity,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s bipartisan support for supporting international talent to be able to come study, work and contribute in the U.S., and, at the same time, there are clearly other forces that can undercut that.\u201d\n\nFor those reasons, the alliance director was hesitant to say how likely the bill is to pass. Instead, she says the focus should be on making lawmakers aware of the damage it could do and helping to make amendments that ensure national security and public safety while continuing to attract top-level academics from around the world.\n\n\u201cColleges and universities are very committed to supporting national security and the recruitment and retention of international students and scholars, and that\u2019s not a contradiction,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important now is to raise awareness about measures that undercut such imperatives that we have, and to work together to try to support our students.\u201d",

These adjustments provide a slight boost to applicants awaiting their turn in the green card backlog.In the EB-1 category, India\u2019s Final Action Date remains unchanged at February 1, 2022. This category, which caters to individuals with extraordinary ability, outstanding professors or researchers, and certain multinational executives, continues to experience high demand, resulting in a stalled progression.For the EB-2 category, designated for professionals holding advanced degrees or individuals with exceptional ability, India sees a two-week advancement to October 15, 2012. While the pace of movement remains slow, it offers incremental progress for those in this highly oversubscribed category.The EB-3 Professionals and Skilled Workers category, which includes professionals with bachelor's degrees and skilled workers, also shows a two-week advancement for India, moving to December 15, 2012. Similarly, in the EB-3 Other Workers category, catering to unskilled labor, India\u2019s Final Action Date advances by two weeks to the same date of December 15, 2012.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)In the EB-5 category, which covers immigrant investors in job-creating enterprises, there is no change for India. The Final Action Date remains at January 1, 2022 for unreserved categories. However, all set-aside categories, including Rural, High Unemployment, and Infrastructure, remain current, allowing eligible Indian investors to proceed without delays.USCIS has confirmed that employment-based adjustment of status applications will be accepted in February based on the Final Action Dates chart. Foreign nationals are eligible to file if their priority date precedes the relevant Final Action Date for their category and country.Understanding the Visa Bulletin is crucial for individuals seeking Green Cards, as it provides vital information about the timeline for adjusting immigration status and eligibility based on application submission. The bulletin acts as a guide for the Green Card journey, featuring two essential sections.This section specifies the earliest date applicants can submit their adjustment of status or immigrant visa applications. It helps applicants determine when they can proceed with their filing based on their visa category and country of origin.These dates estimate the wait time for application approval, leading to permanent residency. They function as a queue based on visa category and nationality, indicating when applicants can expect their applications to be processed.However, there's a crucial caveat for employment-based green card (EB) adjustments. To file in August 2024, applicants must have an application date preceding a specific date listed for their category and country in the bulletin, ensuring their eligibility for filing.The significance of final action dates lies in their role in application processing. These dates vary depending on the visa type and nationality, directly impacting the duration of the green card application process and potential wait times. Understanding and monitoring these dates is essential for individuals navigating the Green Card application process.The Visa Bulletin outlines preference categories for family-sponsored immigrants, providing critical information for navigating the Green Card process. The categories are as follows:The bulletin provides detailed insights into the allocation of immigrant visas, primarily based on priority dates and demand received by April 1st of each fiscal year. When demand surpasses the available visas in a particular category or country, that category is classified as oversubscribed. In such cases, the final action date for oversubscribed categories is determined by the priority date of the first applicant who couldn't be accommodated within the numerical limits.For the fiscal year 2024, the limit for family-sponsored preference immigrants is set at 226,000, with specific allocations for each preference category. Additionally, there are per-country limits set at 7% of the total annual family-sponsored and employment-based preference limits. Immigrant visas are issued in order of priority based on the filing date of the petition.Spouses and children of preference immigrants are entitled to the same status and consideration as the principal applicant. In instances where visa issuances surpass the per-country limit, visa prorating provisions come into effect for oversubscribed chargeability areas, including China (mainland born), India, Mexico, and the Philippines. These provisions ensure fair allocation of visas among applicants from different countries.Understanding these intricacies is crucial for individuals navigating the immigrant visa process. The Visa Bulletin serves as a vital tool, providing essential information about visa availability and processing times, helping applicants plan their immigration journey effectively.The allocation of immigrant visas in the employment-based preference categories is structured to ensure a balanced distribution among various types of skilled and unskilled workers, professionals, and investors. Understanding these categories and their allocation percentages is crucial for individuals seeking employment-based immigrant visas.1. Priority Workers: This category receives 28.6% of the global employment-based preference level. It includes:Additionally, any surplus numbers not used for the fourth and fifth preferences may also be allocated here.2. Members of the Professions Holding Advanced Degrees or Individuals of Exceptional Ability: This category is also allotted 28.6% of the global employment-based preference level, plus any numbers not required by the first preference. It covers:3. Skilled Workers, Professionals, and Other Workers: This category receives 28.6% of the worldwide level, along with any numbers not required by the first and second preferences. It includes:4. Certain Special Immigrants: This category is allocated 7.1% of the global level and includes:5. Employment Creation: This category also receives 7.1% of the global level. It is further divided to ensure targeted investment and job creation:These employment-based preference categories are designed to attract a diverse pool of talented individuals to the United States, fostering economic growth and innovation. By understanding these allocation percentages and categories, applicants can better navigate the U.S. immigration system and plan their visa applications accordingly.",

            "content": "Companies using the H-1B visa program to hire skilled workers from abroad should prepare for an application process that takes longer and costs more, along with site visits and heavier regulation of the program, according to an attorney specializing in employer-based immigration.\n\nHaving campaigned on an immigration-heavy platform, pledging significant changes, president-elect Donald Trump has discussed deporting millions of undocumented people.\n\nHowever, legal immigration is also expected to be affected and many employers are bracing for potential disruptions in the H-1B program, which offers 85,000 visas annually to highly educated workers with specialized skills.\n\nMost of the employees are from India and China, many of them engineers hired by large technology companies after they complete their university studies in the U.S. The H-1B visa is for three years but can be renewed.\n\nA Biden administration modernization of the H-1B rules, designed to increase the program\u2019s efficiency, takes effect on Friday, three days before Trump\u2019s inauguration. The changes were designed to make the 35-year-old worker program more flexible for employers, and harder to change dramatically by administration. Biden\u2019s modernization also gave the executive branch more oversight tools to monitor H-1B compliance.\n\n\u201cThe modernization rule was largely put in place to codify a lot of the areas that the first Trump administration had targeted and tried to use executive orders to change,\u201d Ann Lee, a Holland & Hart partner specializing in employment immigration, told Legal Dive Monday.\n\n\u201cSo if the Trump administration wanted to change it back, it would be a big hurdle. Does it mean it\u2019s not possible when they put their mind to it? No. But it may also mean they just kind of work within the confines of what they already have.\u201d\n\nThe H-1B visa program has become a topic of fierce conflict within Trump\u2019s Republican party before the incoming administration takes office.\n\nLast month, two of Trump\u2019s wealthy supporters, billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, posted their support of expanding the program, with Trump appearing to side with their view. \u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program,\u201d Trump told the New York Post Dec. 28, when asked about the intra-party conflict.\n\nMusk\u2019s companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have both hired large numbers of engineers using the visa program. Musk has said the U.S. does not produce enough natively born, qualified engineers with the work ethic his businesses need.\n\nTrump\u2019s first administration sought to reduce the number of H-1B visas. Denials of new H-1B petitions for initial employment rose from 6% in fiscal year 2015 to 24% in 2018, according to data recently compiled by the American Immigration Council. The denial rate declined later in Trump\u2019s first term as companies contested the government\u2019s rulings.\n\n\u201cI think it will be interesting to see how much weight Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may end up having, because the first Trump administration heavily targeted H-1Bs,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIs it possible he doesn\u2019t target (H-1B visas) as much, especially because of Musk and Ramaswamy? Yes. But is anyone sitting comfortably here? No. I think time has shown that the Trump administration may not always have been consistent and followed through, if they preferred something or not.\u201d\n\nHow to prepare\n\nWhile the focus in many industries has been I-9 compliance \u2014 and enforcement against undocumented workers\u2014 companies that rely on H-1B employees should focus on \u201cpublic access files,\u201d or the physical and electronic notices regulators require them to post information about the role being filled via a foreign-born person, Lee said.\n\nFor many companies, \u201cit\u2019s easy to not be in compliance with their public access files,\u201d she said. \u201cHow often is someone looking at them?\u201d\n\nAnother issue to consider, Lee said, is whether any employees working on H-1B visas have relocated in recent years, perhaps as part of a remote-working opportunity in a more affordable locale. The visa is granted for a specific location, for example, California or New York City. If the employee has moved to another state, that presents grounds for potentially revoking the visa.\n\nCompanies that need H-1B employees must evaluate their needs and budgets and prepare for processing delays, Lee said. Some companies are forming task forces to identify key \u201cstakeholders\u201d who need to be involved in the worker-sponsorship process, and allocating costs for the process to specific budgets, she said.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is likely to increase their requests for evidence for a range of worker-visa programs and \u201cthat\u2019s going to lead to more legal fees and time delays,\u201d Lee said. These task forces also should consider potential travel restrictions and how that could affect their H-1B workers.\n\nFor in-house legal departments and human resources professionals, \u201cmake sure there are people ready to target these questions and address them at a higher level,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think with a lot of companies immigration usually falls under HR rather than the legal department so it\u2019s probably good to make sure there is more of a connection between HR and talent acquisition and the legal team.\u201d",

The definition of \u201cdesignated country\u201d was amended to refer to countries that the Secretary of Homeland Security has designated for VWP participation and remove references to specific countries in the regulations.

            "content": "A fight erupted on social media in late December pitting allies of President-elect Donald Trump against one another on the topic of visas for highly skilled immigrants.\n\nMAGA influencer Laura Loomer denounced the H-1B visa program that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with certain skill sets. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called it a \"scam.\" On the other side, billionaire Elon Musk, a former H-1B visa holder whose companies employ such visa holders, called for the program\u2019s reform but defended it as an important talent recruitment mechanism.\n\nTrump, who sought reforms of the H-1B program during his first presidential term, sided with Musk.\n\n\"I have many H-1B visas on my properties,\" Trump told the New York Post in late December. \"I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program.\"\n\nDays later, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., disputed Musk, saying corporations abuse the program as a way to get richer and should recruit American workers first.\n\n\"If this program is really supposed to be about importing workers with highly advanced degrees in science and technology, why are H-1B guest workers being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers? Can we really not find English teachers in America?\"\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump\u2019s immigration agenda largely focused on promises to reduce illegal immigration; he didn\u2019t talk much about work visas. But the recent social media battle may foreshadow tensions within the incoming Trump administration over the future of nonimmigrant visas.\n\n\"It is too early to tell which side will prevail in this battle,\" said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a retired Cornell University immigration law professor. \"People like Elon Musk want to preserve H-1B visas. Other Trump administration officials like Stephen Miller want to restrict all immigration, including H-1Bs.\"\n\nWe examined Sanders\u2019 statement about the types of workers who obtain H-1B visas. Here\u2019s the rub with his claim: Employers can \u2014 and have \u2014 sought foreign workers as dog trainers and massage therapists. But Sanders is plucking out very rare situations (teachers are more common). The majority of people with the visas have jobs in the tech industry, not the jobs Sanders cited.\n\nMajority of H-1B holders are in computer jobs, but some are teachers\n\nThe H-1B visa program lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty fields. The majority of these workers have been hired in STEM occupations, with about two-thirds working in computer-related fields, according to the Congressional Research Service. STEM refers to science, technology, engineering and math occupations. Most H-1B visa holders come from India.\n\nProspective H-1B employers must attest that they will pay the H-1B worker the greater of the actual wages paid to similar employees or the prevailing wages for that occupation.\n\nTo qualify for the nonimmigrant visa, the worker must hold a specialized degree, license or training required by the occupation. The status is generally valid for up to three years and renewable for another three years, but can be extended if the employer sponsors the worker for a green card.\n\nCongress caps annual new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees.\n\nThe program has long been a subject of debate. Proponents say the visas allow American employers to fill gaps and allow them to compete with other countries and recruit the \"best minds.\" Critics point to fraud or abuse in the program and say they favor policies that incentivize hiring Americans.\n\nEmployers apply to the Labor Department to use the program. Virtually every application is approved, allowing employers to apply for employee visas through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of State.\n\nIn 2023, most visa approvals were for people who work in computer-related jobs; 6% went to people working in education, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, although the agency\u2019s data didn\u2019t specify how many were English teachers. It also did not mention dog trainers, cooks or massage therapists.\n\nAsked for evidence behind Sanders\u2019 statement, a Sanders spokesperson sent us links from a third-party website that showed employers\u2019 Labor Department applications filed from 2020 to 2024 included requests for visas for dog trainers, massage therapists, English teachers and even cooks.\n\nBut those links did not show whether the applications were approved (the government calls that \"certified\") or whether the employers were successful in getting the visas. And it represented a tiny speck of the applications \u2014 for example, three applications for the dog trainers, two for massage therapists and 10 for cooks. Requests for English teachers were more plentiful in the data Sanders\u2019 office pointed us to \u2014 about 100 \u2014 but still represented a small fraction of the overall pool of applications filed during those years.\n\n\"There are a decent number of H-1Bs for English teachers, and that's not inappropriate because the jobs usually require a college degree,\" said David Bier, immigration studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"They are usually teaching English as a second language, and many schools think it is helpful to know Spanish or another language while teaching English. It can be especially difficult for rural districts to find teachers in general, let alone ones with dual language ability.\"\n\nThe Dallas Morning News, a PolitiFact partner, reported that in fiscal year 2022, the Dallas school district sponsored 232 workers on H-1B visas, the largest number of any district in the country. Most of the H-1B holders were bilingual teachers in the district, where about half of the students do not speak English as their primary language. The district has hired teachers through the H-1B program for 25 years.\n\nSmaller school districts have also filled vacancies with H-1B visas. Jackson, Mississippi, public schools, which have about 17,000 students, have five high school English teachers on H-1B visas, plus teachers for math and science, said Sherwin Johnson, a district spokesperson. The teachers fill critical shortage areas, Johnson said.\n\nNationwide teacher shortages, and scarcity of qualified bilingual teachers, have been widely reported. But does the United States have a shortage of dog trainers?\n\nSanders is barking up the wrong tree here. The data Sanders\u2019 sent us showed only two organizations that sought dog trainers, and we reached one of them.\n\nPatrick Glines, CEO of Guide Dogs of Texas, told PolitiFact that before he applied for a visa, he advertised for about two years to fill a position to train dogs for people who are blind, and had no luck. The job of training dogs for people who are blind is \"incredibly niche\" and is different from training a dog who has behavior issues, Glines said. It takes about three years until someone can do the job on their own.\n\nGlines ended up training a man in Chile, so he hired him through an H-1B visa.\n\n\"In this situation, it has been a significant help for us,\" Glines said. \"It is absolutely a one-off for me, I doubt I will ever apply for another one. In this one instance it has been incredibly beneficial for people who are blind in Texas.\"\n\nThe Labor Department posts employers applications online each quarter, and for the most recent quarter, most of the jobs we saw were within the tech and sciences sectors \u2014 some for cooks or teachers and only one for a massage therapist.\n\nEmployers must prove that a job meets the visa requirements.\n\n\"Technically, the rule for H-1B is that the job requires the training that comes with at least a bachelor\u2019s level education or its equivalent,\" said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute. \"So if it is a specialized masseuse job that requires that level of education, theoretically it could qualify. The burden would be on the employer to make the case to USCIS.\"\n\nCosta noted that a law firm wrote on its website that, \"Years ago, we saw H-1B approvals for a massage therapist, an airline pilot, and an assistant college sports coach. In most cases these jobs do not require a bachelor\u2019s degree and would almost definitely not be approved today.\" (The Massachusetts law firm has since closed.)\n\nWe asked Sanders\u2019 spokesperson whether he had data showing how many H-1B visa holders were ultimately hired as English teachers, cooks, massage therapists and dog trainers and did not get a reply to that question. To see what H-1B applications were granted, we would need access to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data (generally filing Freedom of Information Requests with the federal government is a lengthy process.)\n\nPolitiFact ruling\n\nMostly False\n\nSanders said H-1B guest workers are \"being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers.\"\n\nData shows the majority of the workers who obtain H-1B visas work in science and technology fields. In 2023, about 65% of approved petitions were for workers in computer-related jobs and 6% were in education, but they were not all English teachers.\n\nAlthough Sanders\u2019 office pointed to a sampling of employer applications submitted to the Labor Department requesting visas for massage therapists, cooks and dog trainers, that data didn\u2019t show how many actually got visas. And his statement ignored that in some cases even these occupations require specialized training, such as being able to train dogs for blind people or teaching students in two languages.\n\nBy plucking out random applications, Sanders leaves voters with a distorted picture of the majority of the job titles held by H-1B visa holders.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",

            "content": "Employers should prepare for major changes to employment-based immigration under the incoming Trump administration, including increased worksite enforcement, slowed-down processing, restrictions on employment-based visas, and a rollback of Biden administration policies, experts said.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign included plans for mass deportations of undocumented workers, reversals of Biden-era actions, and the undoing of programs such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which cover hundreds of thousands of workers.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that Congressional legislation around immigration will once again be at an impasse. But the Trump White House will likely issue a flurry of executive actions and regulatory changes to restore policies from the first Trump term that were halted by litigation or revoked by President Joe Biden, including stricter eligibility criteria for temporary work visas and employment-based green cards.\n\n\u201cThere are things we can expect with higher certainty and things that are more like question marks,\u201d said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. \u201cWith higher certainty, we can expect a return to increased scrutiny of applications, a bigger focus on fraud detection, slower immigration processing, and more country-based travel bans,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what we saw the first time, but intensified to a new level,\u201d said Cecilia Esterline, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nAndrew Wilson, an immigration attorney and partner at Lippes Mathias in Buffalo, N.Y., agreed that President Trump\u2019s first term holds the answers to what to expect over the next four years. One thing that might reappear: discussion of a merit-based or points-based immigration system.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration could make changes in that direction through executive orders, regulatory updates, and policy guidance,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cNew leadership at the Department of Homeland Security and the immigration agencies will interpret and enforce the current laws differently. The laws don\u2019t even have to change if you have people enforcing them differently.\u201d\n\nEmployers should anticipate changes to employment-based immigration hiring practices and compliance responsibilities, said Denise Gavica Perez, chair of the immigration planning and compliance practice at Akerman, based in Miami.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is likely to push forward with stricter enforcement, and employers should begin preparing for these imminent changes, particularly in areas such as E-Verify and I-9 compliance, and employment visa and work authorization processes,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to experts, other actions a second Trump administration might take include:\n\nRevising the H-1B visa program to make it more selective.\n\nUsing backlog numbers to trigger the automatic suspension of applications from employment-based green card categories.\n\nAdvocating for mandatory E-Verify registration.\n\nSignificantly increasing worksite inspections and I-9 audits, including immigration raids on employers in industries suspected of hiring undocumented immigrant workforces; affected employers will include those operating farms and meat processing plants.\n\nExperts also said that while some of President-elect Trump\u2019s plans can be implemented quickly through executive or administrative action, many of those efforts are likely to be challenged in court, similar to Trump\u2019s first term in office.\n\n\u2018Sand to the Gears\u2019 of Legal Immigration\n\nTara Watson, director of the Center for Economic Security and Opportunity at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., predicted that the Trump administration will add \u201csand to the gears\u201d of existing legal immigration pathways.\n\n\u201cGiven the backlogs in many parts of the system, simply slow-walking the routine work of immigration processing could reduce employment-based immigration, as occurred during the first Trump administration,\u201d she said.\n\nEsterline expects \u201cmore memoranda at USCIS shifting the agency\u2019s role to more of a vetting responsibility rather than a benefit-granting role.\u201d\n\nTake H-1B petitions as an example. The denial rate for those visas increased from 6% in 2015 to 24% in 2018 simply as the result of memos and policy guidance, according to Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy in Arlington, Va. The denial rate dropped to 4% after court rulings and a legal settlement in 2020.\n\nSimilarly, requests for evidence (RFE) reached 60% for H-1B petitions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, before falling to 10% in fiscal year 2022, Anderson said.\n\nExperts believe that the Trump administration will look to once again eliminate a policy granting deference to applicants with prior immigration case approvals, something that was reinstated by the Biden administration.\n\n\u201cThe rescission of deference to prior case approvals was a major setback in the immigration world during the first Trump administration, specifically for employment-based visa renewals, such as H-1B visas,\u201d said Jorge Lopez, chair of the immigration and global mobility practice group at Littler, based in Miami.\n\nThe change added to the backlog in visa adjudication as officers were required to review each application as if it were a new application, even if there were no changes to the applicant\u2019s employment conditions or eligibility, Lopez explained.\n\n\u201cIf implemented again, this has the potential to disrupt a business\u2019 ability to maintain a steady workforce if it relies on foreign workers,\u201d he said.\n\nMore Scrutiny, Longer Waits\n\nPerez said that employers can expect heightened scrutiny of visa petitions, including stricter evaluations of job duties, qualifications, wage compliance, and recruitment. This may lead to increased RFEs and other challenges, with additional documentation required to verify that positions qualify as specialty occupations or align with prevailing wage requirements.\n\n\u201cProcessing delays are likely, and the adjudication process may be more rigorous, leading to longer wait times and more documentation required to support PERM labor certifications and employment-based green card petitions and applications,\u201d Perez said.\n\nThere will be more of a focus on fraud detection and national security concerns related to certain countries at U.S. consulates abroad, Gelatt said. \u201cI would expect the reimposing of visa interviews for most people processing abroad, which would hurt overall consular capacity, adding to longer delays at consulates, and a growing backlog for visa interviews,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Trump administration restricted the use of visa interview waivers, which were commonly used under the Obama administration. The Biden administration reinstated the use of those waivers.\n\nPerez said that the new administration is expected to tighten entry restrictions, reintroduce travel bans for certain countries, and institute rigorous security screening procedures for foreign nationals, including biometric data collection and extensive background checks. Countries previously affected by travel bans may face similar restrictions, potentially impacting both work-related and personal travel for foreign workers.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that we will see a version of the \u2018Buy American, Hire American\u2019 executive order [from Trump\u2019s first term], which sought to promote domestic manufacturing and protect U.S. jobs by prioritizing American workers and businesses, under a new Trump administration,\u201d Lopez said.\n\nRegulations Redux\n\nSome of the regulations proposed\u2014but never realized\u2014during the first Trump term are likely to resurface, including plans to redefine eligibility for the H-1B visa program and update prevailing wage rules for H-1B and employment-based green card workers.\n\nIn its final days, the Biden administration accelerated the publishing of several employment-based immigration rules, which included codifying much of the H-1B process, strengthening worker protections in the H-2 seasonal visa programs, and permanently increasing the automatic extension period for work permits for certain renewal applicants.\n\n\u201cIf the H-1B rule was not finalized in time, a new administration could easily halt implementation and more easily draft more restrictive regulations,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBeing final makes it a much more arduous task to try and rescind it,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the Trump administration will seek to make changes to or withdraw the regulation. The incoming 119th Congress could also invoke the Congressional Review Act to repeal the rule.\n\n\u201cI expect another attempt at updating prevailing wage rules for H-1B workers, increasing salaries for eligibility, and making it more difficult to hire those workers,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nRaising the required salary became another way to make it difficult for employers to hire H-1B visa holders or sponsor highly skilled foreign-born employees for permanent residence, Anderson explained.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the Department of Labor [DOL] published a rule aimed at pricing high-skilled foreign nationals out of the labor market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe DOL changed the formula for calculating the prevailing wage, which acts as the minimum wage employers must pay H-1B professionals or green card holders through the permanent labor certification process.\u201d\n\nThe rule was blocked by a judge because it was not accompanied by a public comment period.\n\nThe previous Trump administration had also sought to make it harder for an employer to send an H-1B visa holder to work at a client\u2019s location. That measure was never published in final form.\n\nTrump could take another shot at restricting work authorization for H-4 visa holder spouses of H-1B employees waiting for green cards, Wilson said. This was a benefit the Obama administration granted in 2015. The Trump administration announced its intention to eliminate the rule, but that effort never materialized.\n\n\u201cIf the H-4 [work authorization] program is rescinded, many spouses of H-1B holders will lose their work authorization, which could reduce household incomes and affect the satisfaction and retention of H-1B workers,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nThe loss of H-4 work authorization may make U.S. employment less attractive to skilled foreign workers and would make it difficult for many families to wait years for an employment-based green card.\n\nAny changes to regulations will likely be followed by litigation, but one big new determining factor is the 2024 U.S. Supreme Court decision to end courts\u2019 deference to federal agencies when interpreting statutes, Wilson said.\n\n\u201cWe are left to see how the Trump administration utilizes the new directive, where courts now hold the upper hand,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cAs this is a recent change, it remains to be seen how the administration, or those opposing administrative changes, will utilize the court\u2019s authority. This will create a more activist role for the judicial branch in interpreting immigration statutes and regulations.\u201d\n\nMore Worksite Raids Ahead?\n\nIn a second Trump term, employers should expect 1) more Form I-9 employment eligibility verification audits, 2) more inspections by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service\u2019s Fraud Detection and National Security division, 3) more DOL audits of labor certification and labor condition applications, and 4) more of a focus on discrimination against U.S. workers.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is expected to ramp up enforcement measures across various visa programs, with penalties for noncompliance becoming more severe,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThis scrutiny will extend to wage compliance, employee eligibility verification, and adherence to visa-specific requirements.\u201d\n\nEmployers in industries that are known or suspected to have a high percentage of undocumented workers\u2014such as manufacturing, agriculture, food processing, hospitality, and construction\u2014face the risk of having Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conduct workplace raids.\n\n\u201cWorksite raids can be very disruptive and a concern for businesses but have not historically generated large numbers of arrests or deportations,\u201d Gelatt said. The highest number of worksite arrests was about 6,000 in fiscal year 2008. The Trump administration reported about 2,300 worksite-related arrests in fiscal year 2018.\n\nBut President Trump campaigned on mass deportation, something that could affect millions of undocumented workers\u2014if it could be implemented. The biggest obstacle to mass deportation is resource constraints, particularly when it comes to the money, manpower, and space required to round up, detain, and process millions of people. There\u2019s already a massive immigration court backlog.\n\n\u201cIt will take a lot of resources to get up to one million deportations a year from the U.S. interior, vastly more than has been done before,\u201d Gelatt said. \u201cWe may see more deportations, but not at the scale of what\u2019s being talked about.\u201d\n\nThe largest number of removals came in fiscal year 2012 during the Obama administration, when more than 400,000 people were deported from the U.S.\n\nExperts have warned that the abrupt removal of millions of immigrant workers would likely lead to economic instability, particularly in industries heavily reliant on undocumented labor, such as agriculture and hospitality.\n\nMore Immigration Programs to Come Under Fire\n\nExperts believe that programs such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which currently provide work authorization to hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals, will also likely be curtailed under the new administration.\n\nDACA provides protection for immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. \u201cThe Supreme Court prevented the administration from dismantling the program in 2020 on technical grounds, but the legal effort may well succeed in the new term,\u201d Watson said.\n\nMore than 535,000 people currently have DACA protection, but their status has been under challenge since 2018, when Texas and seven other states brought a lawsuit arguing the program is unconstitutional; the case will likely make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court this year.\n\nThe other program, TPS, allows migrants from countries where unstable conditions (from environmental disasters to armed conflicts) affect their safety to stay and work in the U.S. As of March 2024, more than 860,000 individuals from 17 countries lived in the United States under TPS, with countries of origin including El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and Venezuela.\n\nThe controversy over TPS is that these programs were meant to be temporary, but most countries have been redesignated multiple times, with some TPS grants stretching back over 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration expanded TPS to hundreds of thousands of new beneficiaries,\u201d Gelatt said. \u201cI would expect that the Trump administration will move to end many of those TPS grants, likely when they come to the end of their current duration.\u201d\n\nIn addition to TPS, the Biden administration\u2019s humanitarian parole programs\u2014which allow over 740,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Ukraine to live and work in the United States for two years\u2014will likely come under immediate review.\n\n\u201cThe termination of the DACA and TPS programs would remove work authorization for many employees, potentially leading to workforce shortages in industries that depend on these workers,\u201d Perez said.",

Proponents, meanwhile, maintain that the program ensures companies can continue to access a skilled labor pool \u2014 wherever the talent is located.\n\nSandeep Aujla Courtesy of Intuit\n\nWith a view of both talent and software as global, Mountain View, California-based Intuit, a tax preparation and accounting software company, is among the many Silicon Valley companies that use the program to help bring skilled talent to the U.S.\n\nBetween Aug. 1, 2023 and July 31, 2024, Intuit filed 716 H-1B petitions, of which nearly all (715) were approved and 1 was denied, the company told CFO Dive. The total includes new H-1Bs counted against the annual cap, along with H-1B transfer and extension petitions. The congressionally mandated H-1B cap, or limit, is 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas allocated to individuals who earned a U.S. master\u2019s degree or higher.\n\nVisas spark MAGA backlash\n\nThe H-1B visa program recently sparked a heated debate on social media among key backers of President-elect Trump, with the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) co-leads Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy voicing support for it. Meanwhile, some conservatives, including former South Carolina governor and former presidential candidate Nikki Haley, rallied against hiring workers from outside the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe should be investing and prioritizing in Americans, not foreign workers,\u201d Haley wrote in an X post late last month.\n\nAujla\u2019s views appear to roughly align with those of Musk, who recently suggested the program is a key tool for hiring critical engineering talent.\n\n\u201cOF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process,\u201d Musk posted on X on Dec. 25. \u201cHOWEVER, there is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America.\u201d\n\nPrepping for the Trump administration\n\nAsked about the company\u2019s broader approach to preparing for the incoming administration, Aujla said Intuit has long worked with both political parties.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history of being bipartisan, and our focus remains on the policies that matter most to our customers, who are consumers and entrepreneurs,\u201d he said.\n\nContributions by the Intuit Inc. 21st Century Leadership Fund (Intuit\u2019s affiliated PAC) are almost evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, with about 49.6% of all contributions during the period allocated to Democratic recipients, and 50.4% of contributions going to Republicans. Federal and state contributions in 2023 and 2024 were similarly spread out, with 49% going to Democrats and 51% going to Republicans, the company told CFO Dive.\n\nA good shot\n\nAujla\u2019s comments come as companies are extending overtures to the incoming Trump administration. Intuit is one of many Big Tech firms, such as Amazon and Meta, contributing to Trump\u2019s second inaugural fund, according to The Wall Street Journal. Intuit contributed $1 million to the fund.\n\n\u201cIntuit is committed to ensuring our customers\u2019 voices are heard on important issues, and our expanded participation in the democratic process reflects our growth as a company and the variety of policy issues that impact the approximately 100 million diverse consumers and businesses we serve,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nTech firms are courting the incoming administration because they believe they have an opportunity to influence the course of immigration reform, including the future of the H1-B program, said Chirag Mehta, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research.\n\n\u201cThey have a very good shot at lobbying [for] H1-B reforms. There are quite a few ideas being pitched,\u201d he said.\n\nHurdles with the program, from a CFO\u2019s perspective, include the annual limit of 85,000 H1-B visas and the lottery system for selecting successful candidates, he said.\n\n\u201cEven if you can find talent, there are a whole bunch of challenges,\u201d including the risk of paying legal and filing fees with an uncertain likelihood of success, along with the complexity of transitioning H1-B employees to permanent resident status, he added.\n\nCompetition from free tax prep\n\nThe maker of TurboTax and one of the largest players in the tax preparation software market, Intuit is also facing some changes in the sector.\n\nAmid reports that the incoming Trump administration is considering creating a new free tax filing app, Aujla said he was not concerned about potential competition, pointing out that a new free platform from the government won\u2019t affect demand for Intuit\u2019s TurboTax products. But the government\u2019s efforts would be better directed towards making tax filing easier, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are a plethora of free offerings in the marketplace. The government entering this space and coming up with yet another free offering is not going to change the landscape,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say that's not an area where the government needs to expend much energy. Where we would love the government to expend energy is to make the taxes simpler.\u201d\n\nThe company has historically butted heads with free tax-filing programs offered by the government, lobbying against Direct File, an in-house free filing tool offered by the IRS, according to a Reuters report.\n\nIn a statement shared with CFO Dive Friday, a company spokesperson was critical of the IRS offering. \u201cIRS Direct File is a solution in search of a problem and that solution will unnecessarily cost hard-working Americans billions of dollars for something that already exists,\u201d said Derrick Plummer, director of corporate communications at Intuit.\n\nDirect File began as a pilot in 2024 and will be expanded to 25 states for the 2025 tax season, according to a Jan. 10 IRS release. Intuit was previously a part of Free File, a program that allows taxpayers to file their taxes for free through partner firms, since 2003, but exited the program in July 2021.\n\nLooking ahead, Aujla would prefer to work with the incoming administration on simplifying the tax code to improve the experience of filers, he said.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on, on the consumer side, helping [consumers] get access to their biggest paycheck of the year, which for many, is their tax refund,\u201d Aujla said. \u201cLet's help the consumer get access to the money the fastest way possible.\u201d",

            "content": "Supporting H1-B visas: A personal perspective on innovation and opportunity\n\nAs a young engineer in the early days of Silicon Valley\u2019s technological boom, I had the privilege of being part of a team at Verbatim Corporation that developed and demonstrated the world\u2019s first erasable optical disk. This innovation, later commercialized as the CD-ROM burner, revolutionized data storage. Looking back, it\u2019s clear that the success of this project \u2013 and countless others in tech \u2013 would not have been possible without the contributions of professionals who came to the U.S. under the H1-B visa program.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Verbatim\u2019s engineering team showcased global collaboration. Our vice president of engineering, director of research and development and directors of drive and media development all came to the U.S. on H1-B visas. Two young engineers on the team were also H1-B visa holders. These individuals, all with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering, played critical roles in overcoming technical challenges. Under the leadership of my manager, Dr. Ingolf Sander, we tackled some of the most complex problems in data storage. Our wages were among the highest in Silicon Valley, and none of these H1-B holders displaced American workers. Instead, they filled a skills gap essential for our success.\n\nH1-B visa holders often go on to create jobs and drive economic growth. Consider these examples of technology leaders who began their journeys in the U.S. on H1-B visas:\n\nSatya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, transitioned from a student visa to an H1-B, driving innovations in AI and cloud computing.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, started his career on an H1-B, overseeing transformative products like Google Chrome and Android.\n\nJensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, whose GPUs revolutionized gaming, AI and high-performance computing.\n\nThese individuals\u2019 contributions have generated millions of jobs and positioned the U.S. as a global tech leader.\n\nCritics argue the H1-B program suppresses wages or displaces American workers, but my experience tells a different story. In the 1980s, demand for skilled engineers outpaced supply. Companies like ours competed globally for talent, offering competitive salaries to attract the best minds. The H1-B program was a lifeline that enabled innovation and growth.\n\nToday, industries like software development and biotechnology still face shortages of qualified candidates. Restricting H1-B visas risks stifling innovation and losing competitive advantage to other countries. H1-B visa holders are not just employees; many become entrepreneurs. A 2016 study found that immigrant-founded firms account for 25% of all venture-backed startups in the U.S., disproportionately driving job creation and economic dynamism.\n\nThe personal stories of my colleagues at Verbatim underscore the promise of the American dream. Many chose to become U.S. citizens, raising families and contributing to their communities. Their journeys exemplify the power of opportunity and innovation.\n\nAs we tackle 21st-century challenges, the need for skilled professionals has never been greater. The H1-B visa program enables the U.S. to attract the brightest minds from around the world. By investing in this program, we ensure a future where engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs can build on the foundations we\u2019ve laid.\n\nMy experience at Verbatim demonstrates the critical role H1-B visa holders play in advancing innovation and economic growth. From groundbreaking products like the CD-ROM burner to transformative companies like Microsoft and NVIDIA, skilled immigrants are vital to our success. As a nation, we must support policies that welcome talent and foster collaboration to maintain the U.S.\u2019s position as a global technology leader.\n\nJoe Wallace is a retired CEO of the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership.

Several Indians with American visas told The Strait Times that their employers and immigration lawyers have been asking them to return to the US before Trump assumes power on January 20.\n\nThe rise in fear is coming amid brewing debate among Trump supporters on whether the president should limit the number of H1-B visas awarded to foreign professionals every year. Many Indians are avoiding travelling out of the US fearing that a visa rule change block could block their re-entry to the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe H-1B is a temporary visa to the US for skilled foreign workers with a minimum qualification of a bachelor\u2019s degree. It can be renewed every three years and is considered a stepping stone towards getting a permanent residency and eventually a green card. It is pertinent to note that Indian professionals are one of the main beneficiaries of the H1-B visa.\n\nAccording to The Strait Times, in 2023, 278,148 professionals from India made up more than 72 per cent of H-1B visas issued and renewed, followed by Chinese citizens at 12 per cent. Interestingly, nearly two in three H-1B holders work in computer-related jobs, with an average annual salary of US$118,000.\n\nWhere does Trump stand on the matter?\n\nThe debate on H-1B visas started after Trump named venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan to an advisory role in artificial intelligence (AI). Krishnan was born and educated in India and moved to the United States in 2007 to work at Microsoft. He became a US citizen in 2016 and is now a venture capitalist.\n\nSeveral Trump loyalists especially the supporters of Make America Great initiatives called out Krishnan\u2019s past statements advocating the removal of \u201ccountry caps for green cards\u201d and to \u201cunlock skilled immigration.\" However, he never passed any comments on the H-1B visas, a top raised by supporters of Trump\u2019s Make America Great (MAGA) initiative.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s advisers such as Tesla founder Elon Musk and Republican politician Vivek Ramaswamy have expressed support for legal, high-skill immigration. Trump, however, held contradictory views on the programme. At a New Year\u2019s Eve party in 2024, he told reporters: \u201cWe need smart people coming into our country.\"\n\nBut when asked about H-1B during a 2016 Republican presidential debate, he said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have it. Very, very bad for workers.\u201d Trump has made immigration a core issue during his campaign, frequently mentioning that 1.6 million people immigrated to the US in 2023, the most in two decades. Hence, it will be interesting to see whether he will promote or scale back on providing H-1B visas to professionals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith inputs from agencies.",

However, he added, \"That doesn't mean we should move toward laxity. We must maintain a strict policy, but one that allows us to intelligently condition and simplify our visa policy.\"The acknowledgement of failure stems from the report by Paul Hermelin, submitted to the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs in April 2023, says Le Point.\"The tightening of visa policies is reflected in the numbers: the refusal rate rose from 10.7% in 2010 to around 17% in 2023. This trend confirms the security-focused approach that has dominated in recent years, sometimes at the expense of the country's attractiveness.\"(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates)The issue of resources remains critical, the report by Paul Hermelin says. \"Visas generate substantial income: \u20ac175 million in 2022. Yet consular services receive only a fraction\u20140.75% of the revenue. This is absurd, given that a single day of work by an agent can generate more than their monthly salary.\"Paul Hermelin does not advocate for a relaxation of controls but rather for a better balance between three objectives: security, migration management, and attractiveness, says Le Point. He specifically suggests improving the identification and facilitation of priority \"target audiences\" (talents, entrepreneurs), maintaining strict controls while enhancing administrative efficiency, and adopting a differentiated approach based on applicant profiles, rather than a generalized tightening that unfairly penalizes those who do not deserve it, as per the media house.Cost savings could certainly be achieved by pooling visa services with other Schengen countries for smaller visa operations abroad, Le Point adds.\"Additionally, a Schengen e-visa system will be implemented in 2026. The digitization of Schengen visa application procedures, eliminating consulate appointments and easily forged visa stickers, will completely reorganize the administrative process. Between 22 and 25 million visa applications worldwide will be processed through this platform at its launch, saving time and money for member states.,\" the report by Paul Hermelin says.Le Point notes that Macron has drawn lessons from the Hermelin report and has announced a reform that would implement the recommendations. However, it is yet to be seen what the reform will include exactly and who will be affected the most.",

            "content": "Barbados, Bahamas, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Dominican Republic Boost Visa Free Travel: How Henley Passport Index Highlights Caribbean Passports ?\n\nThe Henley Passport Index, which ranks global passports based on the number of destinations they grant visa-free or visa-on-arrival access, has spotlighted Caribbean nations as leaders in travel convenience. As of January 2025, Caribbean passports like those of Barbados and St. Kitts and Nevis are ranked among the highest globally, offering their holders extensive access to international destinations. However, the advantages these passports provide come with significant financial costs, especially for those pursuing citizenship through investment.\n\nTop-Ranked Caribbean Passports\n\nCaribbean nations have performed impressively in the Henley Passport Index, with Barbados ranking 21st globally, offering access to 165 destinations without the need for prior visas. The Bahamas follows closely at 22nd, with visa-free access to 161 destinations. St. Kitts and Nevis, along with St. Vincent and the Grenadines, are tied at 24th globally, providing entry to 157 destinations. Antigua and Barbuda (27th, 153 destinations) and Trinidad and Tobago (28th, 152 destinations) also make notable contributions to the region\u2019s mobility profile.\n\nSingapore Tops, and Japan Ranks Second, According to Henley Passport Index; Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden Are Also in the List: New Passport News Update\n\nChallenges for Lower-Ranked Passports\n\nWhile the higher-ranked passports simplify global travel, lower-ranked ones such as Jamaica (56th, 89 destinations), the Dominican Republic (67th, 75 destinations), and Haiti (89th, 53 destinations) face greater challenges. Citizens from these nations often endure rigorous visa application processes, requiring substantial documentation to prove intent to return home after visiting wealthier countries. This is a common hurdle for individuals from economically disadvantaged nations seeking entry into regions like the U.S. or the EU.\n\nThe Role of Citizenship-by-Investment Programs\n\nCitizenship-by-Investment (CBI) programs have emerged as a popular route for wealthy individuals seeking access to high-ranking passports. These programs typically require significant financial contributions, ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to direct investments in the host nation\u2019s economy. Participating countries in the Caribbean, such as St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica, offer CBI options that promise visa-free travel to numerous destinations.\n\nWhile these programs provide unparalleled global mobility, they also raise concerns about potential misuse. Critics argue that lax oversight could enable tax evasion or compromise security. However, proponents highlight the economic benefits these programs bring to host countries, such as increased foreign investment and infrastructure development.\n\nVisa-Free Travel: Who Benefits?\n\nThe value of visa-free travel varies significantly among individuals and groups. Frequent travelers, such as businesspeople and digital nomads, benefit immensely from streamlined entry processes. High-ranking passports are particularly advantageous for accessing regions with strict visa requirements, such as the Schengen Zone, the UK, and the US.\n\n2025 Henley Passport Index Unveils Dramatic Shifts in Global Mobility, Ranking the World\u2019s Most Powerful Passports\n\nOn the other hand, occasional vacationers and individuals who rarely travel internationally are less affected by the ranking of their passports. For residents in open-access regions like the Caribbean or South America, visa-free travel holds limited additional value.\n\nGlobal Leaders and Diplomatic Privileges\n\nUnder the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, world leaders often enjoy special visa privileges, including exemptions or diplomatic visas. These benefits extend even to leaders from nations with lower-ranked passports, such as Haiti. However, political factors can influence entry, emphasizing the importance of robust international relations.\n\nSingapore: The World\u2019s Most Powerful Passport\n\nSingapore currently holds the top position on the Henley Passport Index, offering visa-free access to 192 destinations. Unlike citizenship-by-investment programs in the Caribbean, Singapore\u2019s citizenship is not for sale. It can only be obtained through birth, marriage, or long-term residency. Attempts to circumvent these rules are considered serious legal violations.\n\nEthical and Financial Considerations\n\nWhile high-ranking passports provide significant advantages, obtaining them through investment raises ethical and financial questions. The costs associated with CBI programs limit their accessibility to wealthy individuals, often excluding the majority of the population. Additionally, the dual-purpose nature of the Henley Passport Index\u2014as an informative tool and a marketing strategy for CBI services\u2014invites scrutiny regarding its objectivity.\n\nSingapore Leads the Henley Passport Index in Global Mobility as Malaysia Rises in Visa Free Travel\n\nThe Henley Passport Index underscores the value of global mobility, with Caribbean nations leading the region in facilitating visa-free travel. For frequent travelers, businesspeople, and digital nomads, a high-ranking passport offers significant advantages. However, the financial barriers and ethical concerns tied to citizenship-by-investment programs warrant careful consideration. As the travel landscape evolves, passport rankings remain a critical factor for global mobility, shaping opportunities for individuals and nations alike.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nRead Travel Industry News in 104 different regional platforms\n\nGet our daily dose of news, by subscribing to our newsletters.

However, the Final Action Dates show some progress for EB-2 and EB-3 categories for certain countries and categories.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFor the EB-1 category, which covers first-priority workers such as multinational CEOs and individuals with exceptional abilities, there are no changes for most countries, including China and India.\n\nIn the EB-2 category, there are notable advances. China moves forward by one month to April 22, 2020, while India advances two months to October 1, 2012. Other countries will progress to April 1, 2023, a two-week advancement.\n\nIn the EB-3 category, India sees a three-week advance to December 1, 2012, while China moves ahead by two months to June 1, 2020. Other countries will advance by two weeks to December 1, 2022.\n\nThere are no changes in the EB-5 category. India remains at January 1, 2022, while China stays at July 15, 2016, for EB-5 Unreserved categories.

While these categories remain current for now, the rising demand for EB-5 visas suggests that delays could emerge in the future.\n\nUS Immigration Fund (USIF), a leading player in the EB-5 Regional Center industry, and Donoso & Partners, a respected immigration law firm, encourage investors to act proactively in securing priority dates to ensure a smooth path to US permanent residency.\n\nVisa retrogression, when demand exceeds available visas, has historically affected larger EB-5 investor groups, such as those from India and China. However, with growing interest in rural and HUA projects, these challenges may soon extend to investors from other countries as well.\n\nWhat is an EB-5 visa\n\nThe EB-5 Investor Visa Program, established in 1990, allows eligible foreign investors to obtain US permanent residency by investing in a US business. In essence, you can secure a green card by making a qualifying investment in the US economy.\n\nTo qualify for an EB-5 visa, you must invest at least $800,000 in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) and support a business that creates a minimum of 10 jobs for American workers.\n\nAdditionally, you have the option to invest independently or join a group of investors through Regional Centers (RCs). These federally approved entities connect foreign investors with developers seeking funding to grow their businesses.\n\nNotable companies funded through the EB-5 program include Hilton, Hyatt Hotels, Marriott, and Starwood\u2019s SLS Hotel & Casino.",

This policy marks a significant shift in Italy\u2019s immigration procedures, requiring applicants to provide fingerprints as part of their visa application process.\n\nKey Policy Changes and Scope\n\nFor the first time, biometric data collection is being extended to long-term visas under Italy\u2019s revised immigration framework. Previously limited to short-term Schengen visa applicants, this new requirement will now apply to a broader range of visas, including work, family reunification, and study-related visas.\n\nThe process involves mandatory in-person biometric appointments at Italian consulates for Type D visas, which cover stays exceeding 90 days. While this measure enhances security, it adds complexity and length to the visa application process.\n\nImpact on International Students\n\nInternational students are expected to be among the most affected by this policy. Italy, a popular destination for foreign students, may see a decline in its appeal due to the additional hurdles introduced by the new requirement.\n\nStudents enrolling in programs longer than three months will need to account for extra time and expenses, including scheduling biometric appointments and traveling to consulates. This poses a particular challenge for those residing far from consular offices, potentially adding stress to an already complex process.\n\nLogistical Challenges and Concerns\n\nThe introduction of mandatory biometrics raises several operational issues:\n\nProcessing Delays: Extended processing times may lead to delays, affecting students\u2019 academic timelines.\n\nExtended processing times may lead to delays, affecting students\u2019 academic timelines. Added Costs: Travel to consulates and possible time off work or studies may result in financial strain.\n\nTravel to consulates and possible time off work or studies may result in financial strain. Consular Capacity: Questions remain about whether Italian consulates are adequately equipped to handle increased demand.\n\nQuestions remain about whether Italian consulates are adequately equipped to handle increased demand. Backlog Risks: Peak application seasons may see backlogs in appointment availability, further complicating the process.\n\nBalancing Security and Administrative Burden\n\nThe Italian government has emphasized that biometric data collection is a crucial security measure. The collected data, valid for 59 months, spares repeat applicants from resubmitting fingerprints during that period. However, the initial implementation phase is expected to disrupt processes for educational institutions and prospective students alike.\n\nGlobal Context and Comparisons\n\nItaly\u2019s policy aligns with a global trend of using biometrics for enhanced security and identity verification. However, Italy stands out for its comprehensive application of biometrics to all long-term visa types, placing it at the forefront of biometric adoption within the Schengen zone.\n\nStakeholder Reactions\n\nEducational institutions and international student organizations have voiced concerns about the potential impact on Italy\u2019s reputation as a study destination. They are urging the government to introduce measures that mitigate the added burden on students, such as streamlining procedures for educational visas or increasing consular resources to handle the anticipated surge in applications.\n\nHow Applicants Can Prepare\n\nTo navigate these changes effectively, prospective applicants should:\n\nApply Early: Begin the visa application process earlier to account for possible delays.\n\nBegin the visa application process earlier to account for possible delays. Stay Updated: Monitor announcements from Italian consulates and universities regarding new procedures.\n\nMonitor announcements from Italian consulates and universities regarding new procedures. Plan Finances: Budget for travel and other costs associated with biometric appointments.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWhile the immediate focus is on managing the new requirements, the long-term implications include potential standardization of biometric collection across visa categories. Once fully implemented, the system could lead to more streamlined immigration processes. However, initial challenges must be addressed to ensure smoother transitions for students and institutions.\n\nBy adopting these measures, Italy aims to strengthen its immigration system, but the country will need to balance security enhancements with the operational and financial realities faced by visa applicants.\n\nShare On:",

            "content": "The debate over immigration in America has taken a strange turn recently. Elon Musk, Donald Trump\u2019s wealthiest backer and a prolific spreader of dehumanizing anti-immigrant conspiracy theories, finds himself defending an immigrant-visa program against his fellow right-wingers. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders, perhaps the most prominent leftist in the country, has taken to harshly criticizing the same program for undermining American workers. Odder still, the richest man on the planet and the senator who thinks billionaires shouldn\u2019t exist actually agree on what should be done to reform the program.\n\nThe policy in question is the H-1B program, which allocates about 85,000 temporary visas every year to foreign workers who hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree and have expertise in a \u201cspecialty occupation,\u201d such as engineering or information technology. The program is relatively small, but the debate around it could have deep implications for both major political parties. For Republicans, it is a harbinger of a looming intra-MAGA war over skilled immigration that might intensify when Trump enters office. For Democrats, it represents a key front in the fight over whether the party should turn in a nativist direction to repair its toxic brand on immigration. In both cases, the struggle is a preview of just how unpredictable the country\u2019s immigration politics could be over the next four years.\n\nThe debate began just before Christmas, when Donald Trump appointed Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-born former Twitter executive and a vocal supporter of skilled immigration, to be a senior AI-policy adviser in his incoming administration. Laura Loomer, the openly xenophobic MAGA influencer, criticized the decision on X and attacked Krishnan for his views on immigration. Other right-wing figures piled on. This prompted members of the tech right wing, most notably Musk, to defend both Krishnan and high-skilled immigration more broadly. The dispute quickly turned to the merits of the H-1B visa program, as the nativist right argued that the program was designed to replace American workers with foreign labor and the tech right countered that it is necessary to fill a shortage of highly skilled workers and help the U.S. compete with its rivals. \u201cThe \u2018fixed pie\u2019 fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking,\u201d Musk posted on X. \u201cThere is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation.\u201d (The back-and-forth also featured less high-minded arguments. \u201cOur country was built by white Europeans, actually. Not third world invaders from India,\u201d Loomer posted on X. Indians make up more than 70 percent of H-1B holders.)\n\nRog\u00e9 Karma: Why Democrats got the politics of immigration so wrong for so long\n\nEventually, Donald Trump weighed in on the side of Musk, claiming he\u2019d always been supportive of the H-1B program. \u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties,\u201d the president-elect told the New York Post. \u201cI\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program.\u201d (In fact, Trump campaigned against H-1B at points in 2016, and he might have been mistakenly referring to his use of the H-2B visa program for lower-skilled immigrants who work on his properties.) Trump\u2019s intervention caused the controversy to quiet down temporarily. Then an unexpected interlocutor entered the fray.\n\n\u201cBillionaires like Elon Musk claim it is crucial to our economy,\u201d Sanders wrote in an op-ed for Fox News on Wednesday, referring to the H-1B program. \u201cThey are dead wrong.\u201d The Vermont senator went on to accuse H-1Bs of allowing wealthy corporations to enrich themselves by importing cheap labor (or, in Sanders\u2019s phrasing, \u201cindentured servants\u201d) at the expense of native-born workers.\n\nBoth Sanders and Musk turn out to have a point. Sanders is correct that the H-1B program has major flaws that are often exploited by corporations at the expense of workers. A 2021 analysis by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, for instance, found that at least a quarter of H-1B visas are allocated to outsourcing firms, which use the program to import foreign workers, train them up while paying below-market wages, and ultimately return them to their home countries, where they can do the same work at a fraction of the cost. In one infamous case, tech workers at Disney were forced to train their replacements, H-1B visa holders who were subcontracted by an Indian firm, before being laid off.\n\nHowever, Musk is correct in the sense that most careful experimental studies on the program find that, overall, it has neutral or positive effects on the employment prospects and wages of native-born workers. Companies that receive H-1B visas tend to grow faster than companies that don\u2019t\u2014likely because many of them really are hiring foreign workers whose skills they need\u2014and thus often end up employing more native workers overall. Employers receiving H-1B visas also tend to develop new products and technologies at higher rates, which helps create new jobs.\n\nDespite their sharply different takes on the merits of the H-1B program, Musk and Sanders endorse the same set of reforms to it: a combination of raising the salary floor for H-1B visa holders and raising the cost to companies for maintaining an H-1B visa, which together would make it more expensive for a company to hire foreign workers over domestic ones.\n\nBut the fact that Musk and Sanders agree on solutions means very little about the prospects for reform, because the real conflict here is within the parties, not between them. This is especially true on the right, where the fight is over how the second Trump administration should approach skilled immigration. Trump was elected by a coalition that included Silicon Valley technologists, who tend to believe in immigration for skilled workers, and hard-core nativists, who believe that all immigration, at least from most non-European countries, is bad. Both sides will hold considerable power in the incoming administration; the tech right is represented most prominently by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy while the nativist right is represented by Stephen Miller, a longtime opponent of even skilled immigration. Miller shaped much of immigration policy during Trump\u2019s first term, including multiple efforts to limit the H-1B program, and has been tapped for an even larger role in his second.\n\nRog\u00e9 Karma: The truth about immigration and the American worker\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know which faction will ultimately triumph in the second Trump administration. As Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop has pointed out, although Trump has rhetorically endorsed Musk\u2019s position on H-1Bs, he tends to defer to Miller on the substance of immigration policy. The current, mostly online spat over H-1B visas is likely a preview of a larger coming showdown between Miller and Musk. (Complicating matters further, Trump recently appointed Miller\u2019s wife to staff the Department of Government Efficiency alongside Musk and Ramaswamy.)\n\nThe left is engaged in a factional fight of its own. The Democratic Party\u2019s approach to immigration is widely understood to have hurt its standing with working-class voters, including many Latinos. But a new politics of immigration has yet to emerge to take its place. Sanders\u2019s criticism of the H-1B program suggests one direction the party could take: a return to old-school economic populism that portrays certain forms of immigration as a scheme perpetuated by corporations to enrich themselves at the expense of the American worker. Sanders embraced this position during his 2016 presidential campaign, at one point calling open borders a \u201cKoch Brothers proposal\u201d that would \u201cmake everybody in America poorer.\u201d\n\nBack then, Sanders\u2019s immigration skepticism was met by widespread criticism from the left. Not this time. In fact, some of Sanders\u2019s fellow Democrats have leveled their own criticisms at the H-1B program. But the Sanders approach suffers from a glaring flaw: A large body of research shows that even low-skill immigration does not make native-born American workers worse off; high-skilled immigration almost certainly makes them better off. Claiming otherwise might be an effective way for Democratic politicians to win over immigration-skeptical voters. But in the long run, they might find out that false narratives about immigrants, once unleashed, are hard to control.",

(PTI Photo)\n\nMay make mistakes, but won\u2019t do so with bad intentions: PM\n\nNEW DELHI: PM Modi said the decision of US authorities to cancel his visa was taken on the basis of \"falsehoods\" peddled by some people and it rankled with him because it was an insult to a democratically elected govt and the country as a whole.\"Visiting the US as a private citizen was not material to me. But I was the chief minister, heading a democratically elected govt and this was an insult to a democratically elected govt and the country. It troubled me. Some people peddled falsehoods...\" Modi said during a conversation with Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of online trading platform Zerodha, in a podcast.\"But when I addressed a press conference...I said I can visualise a day when people will be queuing up for Indian visas. I said that in 2005... I can clearly see that India's time has come,\" he said in his debut on a podcast, a medium politicians across the world are banking on to get their message across.The US cancelled the visa of Modi on the basis of allegations about his complicity in the communal riots that erupted after 59 kar sevaks on Sabarmati Express were burnt to death in Godhra. An SC-monitored probe cleared Modi of the charge.Modi touched upon the Godhra arson attack, saying he was deeply anguished by the ghastly sight but was obligated to rise above his emotions. \u201cIt was a painful sight. There were dead bodies everywhere, but I knew I am in a post where I have to rise above my emotions. I tried to keep myself together,\u201d he said.He acknowledged that while humans could make mistakes, they should not act with harmful intentions. \u201cWhen I became CM, in one of my speeches, I had said that I will leave no stone unturned in my efforts. Second, I will not do anything for myself. Third, I am a human, I may make mistakes, but I will not make mistakes with bad intentions. I made them my life\u2019s mantras. It is natural to make mistakes, after all I am a human, I am not God, but will not do wrong intentionally,\u201d he said.The free-wheeling conversation covered Modi\u2019s personality as well as important episodes through his career, with Kamath prodding the PM on whether he was a risk-taker, and on parallels, if any, between politics and entrepreneurship, and high entry barrier facing those wishing to join politics.Modi described himself as a risk-taker, emphasising that he could afford to take more risks because he \u201cdoes not have anything personal at stake\u201d. \u201cMy risk-taking ability is several times more and I have not exhausted my risk-taking capacity yet,\u201d he said. At another point, Modi said while he was not immune to anxieties, he could handle them better. \u201cDefinitely, such situations arise... but everyone has a different style and capacity to face such situations,\u201d he said.Asked if he factored in worst-case scenarios while taking important calls, Modi said, \u201cI have never thought about life or death, those who lead calculated lives may feel so. When I became CM, I was surprised how I ended up there because that was not the trajectory I had chosen.\u201d He recalled his desire to become a sanyasi and a monk with Ramakrishna Mission as well as his wanderings in the Himalayas and in the salt deserts of Kutch. \u201cMy background is such that my mother would have distributed sweets in the entire locality if I had become a teacher,\u201d he said.",

These updates are expected to address workforce demands, improve efficiency, and provide greater clarity for employers navigating the complex visa system.\n\nEmployers petitioning for H-1B workers must use the newly updated Form I-129, which becomes mandatory on the same day. To help employers adapt, a preview of the revised form is already available on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website.\n\nKey changes include revised specialty occupation criteria that better link the required degree to job duties, expanded flexibility for nonprofit and governmental research entities exempt from the annual cap, and streamlined processes for F-1 visa holders transitioning to H-1B status. The rule also simplifies processing for previously approved H-1B visa holders and allows individuals with a controlling interest in their petitioning organization to qualify, provided specific conditions are met.\n\nTo ensure program integrity, the rule formalizes USCIS\u2019 authority to conduct inspections and impose penalties for violations. USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou noted, \u201cThe changes made in today\u2019s final rule will ensure that US employers can hire the highly skilled workers they need to grow and innovate while enhancing the integrity of the program.\u201d\n\nDespite these updates, the H-1B program will continue to be subject to an annual cap, with demand far exceeding supply. The USCIS will open cap registrations for the fiscal year 2026 in March 2025, maintaining the lottery-based selection process.",

Trump will be sworn in as the 47th President of the United States on January 20 \u2013 his second term.\n\nStarted in 1990, the H-1B Visa programme allows American employers to hire immigrant workers in occupations that require \u201ca high level of skill\u201d and \u201cat least a bachelor\u2019s degree\u201d, according to the US Department of Labour. The programme was intended to help \u201cemployers who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the US workforce by authorising the temporary employment of qualified individuals who are not otherwise authorised to work in the United States\u201d. However, Trump\u2019s re-election in November brought renewed focus on the programme, two groups of his supporters battling each other over whether stricter immigration controls were needed.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nSharad Lakhanpal, a Lucknow-based doctor who has been living in the US for the last 40 years and is now an American citizen, said the business class there need the H-1B Visas and highly-skilled Indians.\n\n\u201cThough it\u2019s a political issue and we have a new president\u2014Trump- \u2014 coming, we have to see what his policies will be. I don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s tenure will be averse to Indians as he has already appointed many Indians in high-level positions like Vivek Ramaswamy in the newly created Department of Government Efficiency,\u201d said Lakhanpal, who stays in Dallas.\n\nSarada Panda too echoes this sentiment. An Odia living in Dallas for the last 25 years, Panda, a US citizen and vice-president at CitiBank, believes that the business class there needs the Indian workforce.\n\n\u201cMaybe that is why there is a lobby there to increase the number of H-1B visas,\u201d Panda, who works as the vice president in CitiBank, told The Indian Express.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nCurrently, there is an annual cap of 65,000 visas/year under the programme, with an extra 20,000 available to those with a master\u2019s degree or higher from a US university.\n\nCalling the \u201cmuch-debated\u201d Visa programme a \u201cwin-win situation\u201d for both the United States and the motherlands of the beneficiaries, Hariaarjun Patro, a Dallas-based businessman, said the H-1B professionals contribute significantly to both countries.\n\n\u201cThe US government has been supporting professionals from outside countries like India and other countries. It should be continued,\u201d said Patro, who is originally from Berhampur, Odisha.\n\nDebjoyti Roy, a doctor, summed up the row as a \u201ctricky\u201d situation. \u201cOn one hand, there is a need for a skill base but on the other hand, many adjustments are needed. I hope the new regime will take an appropriate call,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe delegation from the US also held a meeting with Union External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.",

            "content": "The visa program changes aim to make it easier for U.S. employers to hire skilled foreign workers.\n\nThe Biden administration made a series of visa program updates last month aiming to make it easier for U.S. employers to hire and retain foreign STEM workers and students. The changes affect the J-1, H-1B, and F-1 visa programs.\n\nThe State Department recently made it easier for some J-1 visa holders to remain in the U.S. by reducing the number of countries on the Exchange Visitor Skills List. The change means that J-1 visa holders from the removed countries are no longer required to return to their country of origin for two years before applying for another type of U.S. visa \u2014 making it easier for U.S. employers to retain talent from these countries. The J-1 visa covers work and study exchange programs in the U.S.\n\nThe list aims to benefit foreign relations by reducing brain drain to the U.S. from countries with skill shortages. The updated list used a new methodology to determine which countries should be included, removing dozens of countries as a result, including China and India. Approximately 300,000 foreign visitors from 200 countries are granted J-1 visas annually.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security published a final rule on Dec. 18 that attempts to modernize the H-1B visa program. H-1B is a temporary visa for skilled foreign workers in specialized occupations.\n\nDHS said in a press release that the changes \u2014 which include a more \u201cstreamlined\u201d approvals process for the H-1B program \u2014 will significantly enhance U.S. companies\u2019 ability to fill job vacancies in critical fields. The changes build on a previous final rule, published in January 2024, to improve the H-1B registration and selection process.\n\n\u201cThe H-1B program was created by Congress in 1990, and there\u2019s no question it needed to be modernized to support our nation\u2019s growing economy,\u201d said Ur Jaddou, director of U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services in the press release. Jaddou said the changes will ensure employers can hire the workers they need to grow while \u201cenhancing the integrity of the program.\u201d The final rule codifies USCIS\u2019 authority to conduct inspections and impose penalties on employers that provide inaccurate information.\n\nUpdates to the H-1B program, which will become effective Jan. 17, expand the types of nonprofit and governmental organizations that can be exempted from annual caps on hiring H-1B workers. Previously, only nonprofit and governmental research organizations whose \u201cprimary mission\u201d is research were exempt from the cap, but the new rule loosens this standard so that such organizations can qualify if research is one of their \u201cfundamental activities.\u201d\n\nThe final rule also includes new language requiring H-1B visa applicants to hold degrees \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the job they want to perform. Some organizations, including the American Physical Society, petitioned DHS to drop that language out of concern that it could exclude people from jobs that are highly relevant to their degree but are not titled accordingly. In a public comment, APS suggested that a USCIS examiner might not realize that a physics background could be relevant for an H-1B position titled \u201cclimate scientist\u201d or \u201coptical engineer.\u201d (APS is an AIP Member Society.)\n\nDHS declined to drop the \u201cdirectly related\u201d language but clarified that they will look for a \u201clogical connection\u201d between the degree an applicant holds and the job duties they would perform. \u201cThese changes recognize that the title of the degree alone is not determinative and that degree titles may differ among schools and evolve over time,\u201d DHS wrote in the preamble to its final rule.\n\nThe updated H-1B visa process also gives F-1 student visa holders applying for an H-1B visa more flexibility to stay in the U.S. while their application is being processed, codifying the automatic \u201ccap-gap\u201d extension so that F-1 visa holders can avoid lapses in immigration status while waiting to hear back about their H-1B petition.\n\nHow the incoming Trump administration will approach visa programs for skilled STEM workers remains unclear. While some high-profile conservatives have been vocal in their opposition to the U.S. hiring more foreign talent, some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, notably Elon Musk and David Sacks, have expressed support for reforming and expanding the H-1B program to make it easier for U.S. companies to hire more foreign tech workers.\n\n",

These changes require employers to strengthen compliance and adapt to ensure effective use of the H-2 programs.\n\nNonimmigrants are Urged to Return to the U.S. Prior to January 20, 2025\n\nAccording to reports, various colleges and universities are warning foreign students to return to campus before President-elect Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, 2025, due to concerns about travel bans imposed during his previous administration and his more recent comments on restricting entry into the United States when he returns to the White House. Upon the January 20, 2017 inauguration, the first Executive Order implementing a Travel Ban was announced on January 27, 2017.\n\nImpact: Employers should consider the risks of employee international travel after January 20th.\n\nDHS Permanently Extends Certain Work Authorization Renewal Periods\n\nOn December 10, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a final rule extending the automatic work authorization renewal period for eligible noncitizens from up to 180 days to up to 540 days.

Notably, China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates, among other countries, have been removed from the list.\n\nThis change means J-visa exchange visitors from these countries are no longer subject to the two-year foreign residence requirement based on the prior Skills List.\n\nImpact: The updated Exchange Visitors Skills List, benefits employers by removing the two-year foreign residence requirement retroactively from countries like China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the UAE. This change allows employers to more easily retain talent from these countries sponsoring non-immigrant visas and green cards without delays tied to the prior requirement.\n\nDOJ Reaches Agreement with Healthcare Facilities Service Provider to Resolve Immigration-Related Discrimination Claims\n\nOn December 6, 2024, the Department of Justice announced that it secured an agreement with Healthcare Services Group Inc. (HCSG), a nationwide provider of housekeeping, laundry, and food services for healthcare and nursing facilities. DOJ\u2019s Employee Rights Section (IER) concluded that HCSG discriminated against a worker by refusing to honor her valid document showing her permission to work because of her citizenship status. IER\u2019s investigation also determined that HCSG had a policy of unlawfully refusing to hire certain workers who had permission to work but were not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents at its Siler City location from at least February 2022 to at least December 2022.\n\nImpact: Employers should ensure anti-discrimination measures are taken during the onboarding and I-9 form completion process or face stiff penalties.",

            "content": "In a hurry to move out of the country? Head to Spain\u2014before it\u2019s too late.\n\nThe European nation has seen a mass migration of Americans pouring into its cities in recent years thanks to its popular golden visa program, which lets individuals gain residency through real estate investments, Bloomberg reported.\n\nEarlier this week, though, the Spanish government confirmed that it would be terminating its residency-by-investment program for non-EU nationals on April 3, 2025\u2014a policy that was first proposed around the same time last year. For prospective buyers, that means there\u2019s currently less than three months to apply, and people are already moving fast so they don\u2019t miss out on the perks.\n\nThe rate of U.S. citizens rushing to Spain to buy homes has doubled since 2014. In fact, there were 41,000 Americans populating the country as of June, which is a dramatic 39 percent spike from just three years ago. And in wake of the golden-visa termination announcement, the demand has skyrocketed in recent days, according to luxe real estate investment firm Golden Partners.\n\nWATCH\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been non-stop requests,\u201d Matt Anderson, a Mallorca-based real estate broker, told Bloomberg. Per the agent, the island has recorded a 12 percent uptick in U.S. buyers over the last year. More specifically, they noted that the sunny, warm climate and top-tier international schools were the main reasons they were relocating.\n\nSince Spain\u2019s golden visa program debuted over a decade ago in 2013, there have been approximately 15,000 visas issued to foreigner homeowners. To get the visa, one must invest in a property worth at least \u20ac500,000 (or $516,000) and live in the country for a minimum of five years.\n\nThe process, however, isn\u2019t always smooth. Take Portugal, for example, which has had a hugely successful golden visa program since it was established in 2012. Most recently, a backlog has pushed applications way past the 90-day deadline, and now those who were hoping for a shot at citizenship are suing. The government has opted to restructure its program, though, instead of ending it entirely.\n\nTourism hot spots such as Greece and Italy have their own similar programs in place, which have also become widely attractive to Americans over the past few years. In December, New Zealand announced it would be tweaking the rules of its golden visa program in an attempt to increase the number of applications coming in. Since 2022, the nation has only issued 35 golden visas, bringing in an extra NZ$352 million. However, that\u2019s nothing compared to the NZ$1 billion (or roughly $580 million) per year that the program used to earn.",

            "content": "Steve Bannon, one of the architects of Trumpism, is one the most influential voices on the right. Bernie Sanders, the veteran US senator from Vermont, is among the leading figures on the progressive left. In these divided times, they have found common ground.\n\nAs Donald Trump returns to the White House, a bitter row over H-1B visas \u2013 designed to bring skilled foreign workers to the US \u2013 has exposed the delicate threads that tie together his broad coalition \u2013 and that of the Democrats.\n\nTrump\u2019s appointment of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, as an adviser on artificial intelligence sparked a backlash from within his base \u2013 fueled in part by anti-Indian racism and criticism of Krishnan\u2019s views on immigration. This was the stage for an acrimonious spat over the merits and pitfalls of the H-1B scheme.\n\nWhile Elon Musk, a close ally of the president-elect, has argued the visas are essential for hundreds of companies at the heart of American industry, Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, has branded the H-1B program a \u201ctotal and complete scam\u201d that deprives American workers.\n\nTrump backed Musk over Bannon, declaring himself to be a \u201cbeliever\u201d in H-1Bs after using them \u201cmany times\u201d in his businesses. But this fight is not over: Bannon is demanding the \u201ccomplete and total elimination\u201d of the scheme, and Musk has declared he would \u201cgo to war\u201d to defend it.\n\nView image in fullscreen Steve Bannon. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBannon, who still holds significant sway over Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, has received support \u2013 albeit indirectly \u2013 from Sanders, who issued a lengthy critique of the H-1B status quo last week.\n\n\u201cElon Musk is wrong,\u201d the senator wrote. \u201cThe main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest\u2019, but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.\u201d\n\nAbout 85,000 H-1B visas are granted every year. More than half a million people are authorized to work in the US under H-1B visas. While these are temporary, and typically granted for three years, holders can try to extend them, or apply for green cards.\n\nTech giants are some of the biggest corporate beneficiaries, with Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Alphabet, the owner of Google and YouTube, and Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among those with the most approved petitions last year, according to the National Foundation for American Policy. Amazon alone had 3,871 petitions approved.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elon Musk speaks with President-elect Donald Trump, who backed Musk over H-1B visas. Photograph: Brandon Bell/Reuters\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest person, and a naturalized US citizen, was born in South Africa. He has himself held an H-1B visa and stated that \u201cso many critical people\u201d in his industrial empire \u2013 which includes Tesla, the electric carmaker, and SpaceX, the rockets and satellites business \u2013 have used the scheme.\n\nLeaders in Silicon Valley have long claimed the system is essential for their businesses and beneficial to the wider economy. In an essay for the Washington Post in 2013, Facebook\u2019s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg questioned why the US offered \u201cso few H-1B visas\u201d that demand greatly outstripped supply, claiming that \u201ceach of these jobs will create two or three more American jobs in return\u201d.\n\nBut critics say it disadvantages Americans because firms are able to recruit workers from overseas \u2013 and pay them less. In a 2020 report, the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI) argued that the program enabled employers to undercut local wage levels.\n\nCompanies \u201chave an incentive to use this program, because they can control the wages, and have a lot of control over the worker\u201d, Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the EPI, told the Guardian. The labor standards around H-1B were too \u201clax\u201d, he argued, and the broader rules \u201cinadequate\u201d.\n\nCosta is in favor of reform, rather than scrapping the scheme altogether. \u201cI agree there needs to be a way for them to hire skilled and talented people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just not the way the program is being used right now.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Bernie Sanders. Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Luis Maga\u00f1a/AP\n\nSo often in politics, the fault lines of debate are drawn by political allegiance. But this is immigration. And this is Trump\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cHis Maga base is against immigration, but they don\u2019t define it further,\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. So on a narrow, nuanced component of the issue \u2013 in this case, H-1B visas \u2013 the coalition is divided.\n\n\u201cThey have different interests involved. Bannon [Trump\u2019s incoming deputy chief of staff], Stephen Miller and others just want undocumented immigrants out,\u201d said Sabato. \u201cBut of course, others have financial interests involved: Elon Musk is representing a big group of tech leaders and others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that this will lead to a compromise. Trump cannot afford to alienate his base. He cannot afford to alienate the richest man on earth, and all of his allies.\u201d\n\nThe dividing lines of this debate are blurred by volatile protagonists. A day after Musk threatened to \u201cgo to war\u201d on issues like H-1B, for example, he made the case for raising the minimum salary requirements for workers granted such visas to make it \u201cmaterially more expensive\u201d for firms to recruit overseas workers. \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSome Democrats are already considering how they might exploit the president-elect\u2019s struggle to unite, and universally satisfy, his base. \u201cLet\u2019s take back the immigration issue by making it an economic issue,\u201d James Carville, the veteran strategist, wrote in the New York Times last week, \u201cand force the GOP to deny bipartisan reform that expedites entry for high-performing talent and for those who will bring business into our nation.\u201d\n\nH-1B emerged as the first battle between the unusual consortium that pushed Trump back into power. It is unlikely to be the last.\n\nSabato pointed to a planned extension of Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar package of tax cuts, which came into effect in 2018, and provided significant boosts to big business and wealthy Americans. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be fights on this, that and the other,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposals \u201cneed to help the working class, who went with him\u201d, added Sabato. \u201cAt the same time, he can\u2019t alienate the rich people.\u201d",

            "content": "The American Immigration Council does not endorse or oppose candidates for elected office. We aim to provide analysis regarding the implications of the election on the U.S. immigration system.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently cut off another path for judicial review of decisions by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) adjudicators. In Bouarfa v. Mayorkas, the Court held that a decision to revoke the prior approval of an immigrant visa petition filed by a U.S. citizen on behalf of her noncitizen spouse could not be reviewed because Congress intended the revocation decision to be completely within the agency\u2019s discretion. The revocation statute says that the secretary of Homeland Security \u201cmay, at any time, for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,\u201d revoke the approval of a family-based or employment-based immigrant visa petition. Yet there is federal district court jurisdiction to review the denial of an immigrant visa petition.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court decided Bouarfa, most federal circuit courts of appeals had already decided that district courts were barred from reviewing revocations of immigrant visa petitions, although some made exceptions where the revocation was based on a purely legal issue or a mixed question of law and fact. But judicial review was available in district courts within the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which includes California, Arizona, Washington and six other states, plus two U.S. territories) because the Ninth Circuit concluded that the statutory language \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d established an objective standard which courts could review. Because the revocation statute applies to immigrant visa petitions beyond a U.S. citizen filing on behalf of their spouse, courts likely will apply the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to bar federal district court review of all decisions by USCIS to revoke immigrant visa petitions.\n\nThe Decision\n\nMs. Bouarfa, a U.S. citizen, had received USCIS approval of an immigrant visa petition filed on behalf of her spouse. But USCIS later revoked the approval, maintaining that the noncitizen spouse\u2019s previous marriage was a \u201csham\u201d (entered into for the purpose of evading U.S. immigration laws). After failing to overcome the USCIS\u2019 notice of intent to revoke and failing to reverse the revocation at the Board of Immigration Appeals, Ms. Bouarfa filed a lawsuit in federal district court. She argued that USCIS\u2019 revocation was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d because the agency lacked sufficient evidence of a \u201csham\u201d marriage. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed on the ground that the Immigration and Nationality Act bars district court review of USCIS\u2019 decision to revoke the approval of the petition, as a \u201cdecision or action\u201d which Congress intends to be in the agency\u2019s discretion.\n\nMs. Bouarfa argued that because USCIS is required to deny an immigrant visa petition if it finds a \u201csham\u201d marriage, then USCIS was required to revoke\u2014a nondiscretionary decision\u2014which the district court could review. However, the Supreme Court agreed with the Eleventh Circuit that the text of the revocation statute clearly gave the Secretary discretion whether to revoke, even when USCIS later decides it wrongly approved the petition. The Supreme Court concluded that the requirements for denying an immigrant visa petition did not carry over to the revocation statute.\n\nEven Broader Impact\n\nThe Supreme Court also has effectively foreclosed, without truly considering, whether the jurisdictional bar should apply when the noncitizen is not in removal proceedings. Ms. Bouarfa assumed that the jurisdictional bar applied but that the decision was not subject to the bar. The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, and the American Immigration Council submitted an amicus brief arguing that Congress intended that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, in which the jurisdictional bar relevant to this case and another jurisdictional bar (which the Supreme Court construed in Patel v. Garland) appear, apply only to cases involving removal proceedings. In Bouarfa, the Supreme Court said that it also \u201cassume[d]\u2014without deciding\u201d that the section of the INA containing the two jurisdictional bars applies \u201cwhen, as here, a noncitizen is neither in removal proceedings nor seeking review of a final order of removal.\u201d Although the Court professes not to decide the issue\u2014which it also did in Patel\u2014it will be difficult to persuade lower courts not to apply the bar when a noncitizen is not in proceedings.\n\nBouarfa potentially creates major problems for employment-based petitions. Ms. Bouarfa has already filed another immigrant visa petition on her husband\u2019s behalf and if it is denied, she will be able to challenge that denial in federal district court. An employer may find the challenges too daunting to continue sponsoring the noncitizen. For example, the noncitizen may have been working for the employer that filed the immigrant visa petition, or for a subsequent employer, based on employment authorization USCIS issued because the noncitizen was a pending adjustment applicant (for a green card). If USCIS later denies the adjustment application and terminates the work authorization after revoking the immigrant visa petition, the noncitizen likely has no option to remain in the United States and continue their employment. And an employer would then face years without the noncitizen\u2019s services in the United States if U.S. Department of Labor and USCIS approval are required to proceed with new processing. And there could be further delays because the demand for employment-based immigrant visa numbers is greater than the annual limits.\n\nBouarfa raises the possibility that USCIS could approve an immigrant visa petition and later revoke to avoid accountability.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a final rule on Dec. 18 updating H-1B visa eligibility requirements and other changes it said would give employers greater flexibility in employing skilled foreign workers.\n\nDHS\u2019 rule follows up on a 2023 proposed rule that sought to \u201cmodernize\u201d the H-1B program. Specifically, Wednesday\u2019s rule revises the definition of \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d to clarify that while sponsoring employers may accept a range of qualifying degree fields when considering candidates for such occupations, the fields must be directly related to a job\u2019s duties in order to meet the specialty occupation requirement.\n\nOther changes include updated definitions for the nonprofit and governmental research organization categories, through which DHS would expand visa cap exemption eligibility for some petitions in these categories. Another set of updates clarifies requirements for visa petitioners. The rule is set to take effect Jan. 17, 2025.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nEmployers should prepare for some potential disruption caused by the new rule, attorneys with law firm Fragomen said in a Dec. 17 blog. The firm said the rule would require use of a new Form I-129 and that adjudicators for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u201cmay take some time to become familiar with the new legal standards.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of many immigration-related adjustments employers might need to make ahead over the next few months. The upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has caused some employment law experts to warn of the potential for worksite investigations, as well as auditing of employers\u2019 Form I-9 compliance practices.\n\nIn a Dec. 17 press release, DHS said its latest rule aimed to improve efficiency as well as flexibility in the H-1B program.\n\n\u201cThe H-1B program was created by Congress in 1990, and there\u2019s no question it needed to be modernized to support our nation\u2019s growing economy,\u201d Ur Jaddou, director of USCIS, said in the release. \u201cThe changes made in today\u2019s final rule will ensure that U.S. employers can hire the highly skilled workers they need to grow and innovate while enhancing the integrity of the program.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s H-1B proposed rule also contained provisions around preventing fraud that DHS addressed separately in a final rule published last January. That rule amended the agency\u2019s process for selecting H-1B visa program registrants, implementing a \u201cbeneficiary centric\u201d process that selects petitions by unique beneficiary rather than by registration.",

They will require a visa\u2014and not an ETIAS travel authorization\u2014to cross the EU\u2019s external borders.\u201d\n\nThis clarification dismisses rumors that Turkish passport holders would have to pay the \u20ac7 ETIAS application fee.\n\nEU travel authorization system clarified for visitors\n\nThe ETIAS aims to improve EU border security by pre-screening travelers from visa-exempt countries. Once active, it will replace passport stamps with an electronic system and track arrivals and departures.\n\nTravelers will apply online, and most will receive approval quickly. The system is designed to streamline border checks and give EU authorities better monitoring tools.\n\nThe ETIAS will launch after the Entry/Exit System (EES) is implemented. The EES will electronically record entry and exit data, ending the use of passport stamps. EU officials plan a phased rollout for both systems, but the exact timeline is still unclear.\n\n(Image courtesy of Tima Miroschnichenko via Pexels)\n\nTurkish visitors unaffected by EU\u2019s digital travel plan\n\nTurkish nationals traveling to EU countries will keep their current travel procedures. Diplomatic and special passport holders can continue to travel visa-free without extra requirements.\n\nMeanwhile, ordinary passport holders will still need to apply for a visa, with no changes to the existing process.\n\nThis clarification aligns with the ETIAS\u2019 goal to simplify travel for visa-exempt countries while keeping policies unchanged for non-visa-waiver nations. It ensures Turkish travelers face no unexpected changes and maintains the integrity of EU border rules.\n\nEU immigration policies unchanged for Turkish nationals\n\nThe ETIAS system marks a major change in how the EU handles visa-free travel, but the exemption for Turkish nationals reflects efforts to uphold bilateral agreements and regional stability.\n\nBy separating visa-exempt and non-visa-exempt travelers, the EU keeps its current visa rules for T\u00fcrkiye while improving security.\n\nEU officials see ETIAS and the EES as tools to unify immigration practices across member states. For countries like T\u00fcrkiye, this approach supports ongoing cooperation while keeping border policies clear and consistent.\n\n(Image courtesy of Ahmad Ardity via Pixabay)\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThe launch of ETIAS strengthens EU travel security without changing existing agreements with T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nBy exempting Turkish nationals, the EU reinforces its commitment to fair travel and migration policies. This decision reassures Turkish travelers during ongoing talks about modernizing border systems.\n\nAs EU countries prepare for ETIAS, travelers and migrants should stay updated through official sources. With systems like EES and ETIAS becoming standard, understanding these processes will be important for meeting future travel requirements in Europe.",

An applicant's priority date must be current in whichever chart USCIS is using in a given month to be eligible to file their application that month. See our prior blog for an explanation on priority dates and Final Action Date chart vs. Dates of Filing chart.\n\nFor January 2025, USCIS announced that it will follow the Dates for Filing chart for employment-based and family-sponsored preference categories \u2013 as shown below. This means that those with current priority dates listed in the Dates for Filing chart are eligible to submit their AOS application from January 1, 2025 to January 31, 2025, and encouraged to complete the filings promptly, and before the end of the month.\n\nEmployment- Based All Chargeability\n\nAreas Except\n\nThose Listed China-\n\nMainland\n\nBorn India Mexico Philippines 1st C 01JAN23 15APR22 C C 2nd 01AUG23 01OCT20 01JAN13 01AUG23 01AUG23 3rd 01MAR23 15NOV20 08JUN13 01MAR23 01MAR23 Other Workers 22MAY21 01JAN18 08JUN13 22MAY21 22MAY21 4th 01FEB21 01FEB21 01FEB21 01FEB21 01FEB21\n\nBelow, we provide key details and takeaways from the updated visa bulletin.\n\nKey Takeaways for Employers and Applicants\n\nUSCIS will follow the Dates for Filing chart.\n\nThe priority dates across all categories in the Dates for Filing Chart remain the same in January as last month.\n\nThe Final Action Dates show some advancement for EB-2 and EB-3 for certain countries/categories, as outlined below.\n\nFinal Action Date Charts Analysis\n\nFinal action dates show slight advancement for EB-2 and EB-3 for some countries and categories, reflecting a change in the date when USCIS or the Department of State (DOS) may adjudicate and issue a final decision on an immigrant visa application or approval of an adjustment of status application. More specifically:\n\nEB-1 \u2013 No Change: The category for first preference workers, including multinational executives and those with extraordinary abilities, remains current for most countries and with no change for India and China.\n\nEB-2 \u2013 Advancements: India advances by two months to October 1, 2012 and China advances by one month to April 22, 2020. All other countries will advance by two weeks to April 1, 2023.\n\nEB-3 \u2013 Advancements: India advances by three weeks to December 1, 2012. China advances by two months to June 1, 2020. All other countries advance by two weeks to December 1, 2022.\n\nOther Workers Category \u2013 Advancements: India advances by three weeks to December 1, 2012. China remains the same at January 1, 2017. All other countries advance by one week to December 8, 2020.\n\nEB-5 \u2013 No Change. In the EB-5 Unreserved categories, China remains at July 15, 2016, and India remains at January 1, 2022. All other countries and the set-aside categories (Rural, High Unemployment, and Infrastructure) also remain current.\n\nImplications and Looking Ahead\n\nThe January 2025 Visa Bulletin provides both opportunities and continued challenges for employment-based immigration. USCIS' acceptance of the Dates for Filing chart for Adjustment of Status filings offers a welcomed window of opportunity for many applicants to secure travel and work authorization documents based on the submission of the Adjustment of Status Application.\n\nThe January 2025 Visa Bulletin also shows little retrogression and slight advancements in final action dates for EB-2 and EB-3 for some countries and categories. While this is a positive sign, the overall waiting period remains lengthy and these prolonged wait times continue to challenge employers seeking to retain top talent.\n\nThe Bulletin reports on the rising approvals of I-526E petitions and increased application completions in EB-5 set-aside categories. To ensure annual limits are not exceeded DOS may introduce Dates for Filing and Final Action Dates. DOS states that the situation will be monitored, and adjustments made as necessary.\n\nThe February 2025 visa bulletin is expected to be released sometime in mid-late January.\n\nThe content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

These stocks are backed by companies with strong brand names and reputations that generate dependable earnings and consistent dividends, which provide stability and passive income during turbulent market conditions.\n\nIn recent years, Wall Street has become reliant on the best blue chip stocks. While the S&P 500 was up by about 24% in 2024, most of the gains were driven by gains in seven of the biggest blue chip stocks. The \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks, which include seven of the biggest companies by market cap, accounted for a 13.7% point gain in the S&P 500. Therefore, investors who focused on these stocks ended up generating significant gains.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds.\n\nThe trend is not expected to change in 2025. Blue chip companies should be the biggest beneficiary as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and the new administration under Donald Trump pushes for fewer regulations. The easing of regulatory pressure that has taken a significant toll on tech giants should be a boon to see blue chip stocks edge even higher. David Miller, co-founder at Catalyst Funds, expects blue chip stocks to continue leading the way in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe Mag 7 stocks are generating significant growth in terms of revenue and earnings power,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cThese companies are massive monopoly businesses with strong fundamental tail winds. I have no reason to believe that the Mag 7 names won\u2019t continue to dominate the S&P in 2025.\u201d\n\nValuations among the blue-chip stocks have gotten out of hand after two years of blockbuster gains amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Blue chip companies boast significant profits and a competitive edge to back their valuations up, however.\n\n\u201cThe Magnificent Seven are not pie-in-the-sky companies: They\u2019re generating \u201ctremendous\u201d revenue for investors\u201d, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. \u201cHow much more gain can be made is the question,\u201d he added.\n\nTherefore, any well-diversified investment portfolio should include some of the best blue chip stocks. It\u2019s the only way investors can take advantage of the market rally that\u2019s driven by various factors, including the artificial intelligence frenzy, robust economic growth and friendly monetary policy.",

Strengthening post-study opportunities and clearer visa pathways will also contribute to solidifying India\u2019s reputation as a global education hub,\u201d said Aritra Ghosal, founder, OneStep Global.\n\n\u201cWe are keen to work alongside the Study in India initiative by partnering with Indian universities to streamline student engagement, enhance outreach, and promote India as a destination of academic excellence.\u201d\n\nWith international students hailing from countries such as Madagascar, Sudan, Syria, Nepal, Bhutan, the USA, UAE, and Oman, DSU boasts a diverse international student body.\n\nMathew highlighted that alongside this diversity, there are key challenges that require government intervention and the establishment of supportive systems.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenges in attracting international students include complex visa and immigration policies, which, coupled with restrictive stay-back options, can deter applicants. Affordability concerns for students from developing countries, global recognition of universities, and cultural adaptation are some of the other obstacles,\u201d said Mathew.\n\n\u201cAddressing these challenges requires proactive government support through flexible visa policies, streamlined immigration processes, robust scholarship programs, and fostering partnerships between universities and global academic institutions.\u201d",

            "content": "H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers\n\n8 January 2025 Share Save Soutik Biswas and Zoya Mateen \u2022 @soutikBBC BBC News, Delhi Share Save\n\nAFP Donald Trump and Elon Musk have defended the visa programme\n\nAshish Chauhan dreams of pursuing an MBA at an American university next year - a goal he describes as being \"stamped in his brain\". The 29-year-old finance professional from India (whose name has been changed on request) hopes to eventually work in the US, but says he now feels conflicted amid an immigration row sparked by President-elect Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme. The H-1B visa programme, which brings skilled foreign workers to the US, faces criticism for undercutting American workers but is praised for attracting global talent. The president-elect, once a critic, now supports the 34-year-old programme, while tech billionaire Elon Musk defends it as key to securing top engineering talent. Indian nationals like Mr Chauhan dominate the programme, receiving 72% of H-1B visas, followed by 12% for Chinese citizens. The majority of H-1B visa holders worked in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, with 65% in computer-related jobs, in 2023. Their median annual salary was $118,000 (\u00a394,000). Concerns over H-1B visas tie into broader immigration debates. A Pew Research report shows that US immigration rose by 1.6 million in 2023, the largest increase in more than 20 years. Immigrants now comprise over 14% of the population - the highest since 1910. Indians are the second-largest immigrant group - after Mexicans - in the US. Many Americans fear this surge in immigration could harm job prospects or hinder assimilation. India has also surpassed China as the leading source of international students, with a record 331,602 Indian students in the US in 2023-2024, according to the latest Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange. Most rely on loans, and any visa freeze could potentially devastate family finances.\n\n\"My worry is that this [resistance to H-1B visas] could also spark animosity towards the Indians living there. But I can't park my ambitions, put my life on hold and wait for the volatility to subside because it's been like this for years now,\" Mr Chauhan says. Efforts to restrict the H-1B programme peaked under Trump's first term, when he signed a 2017 order increasing application scrutiny and fraud detection. Rejection rates soared to 24% in 2018, compared to 5-8% under President Barack Obama and 2-4% under President Joe Biden. The total number of approved H-1B applicants under Biden remained similar to Trump's first term. \"The first Trump administration tightened H-1B visas by increasing denial rates and slowing processing times, making it harder for people to get visas in time. It is unclear whether that will happen again in the second Trump administration,\" Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School, told the BBC. \"Some people like Elon Musk want to preserve the H-1B visas, while other officials in the new administration want to restrict all immigration, including H-1Bs. It is too early to tell which side will prevail.\" Indians have a long relationship with the H-1B visa. The programme is also the reason for the \"rise of Indian-Americans into the highest educated and highest earning group, immigrant or native in the US\", say the authors of The Other One Percent, a study on Indians in America. US-based researchers Sanjoy Chakravorty, Devesh Kapur and Nirvikar Singh noted that new Indian immigrants spoke different languages and lived in different areas than earlier arrivals. Hindi, Tamil and Telugu speakers grew in number, and Indian-American communities shifted from New York and Michigan to larger clusters in California and New Jersey. The skilled visa programme helped create a \"new map of Indian-Americans\".\n\nAtal Agarwal moved back to India from the US because he had reached a 'dead end' on an H-1B visa\n\nThe biggest draw of H-1B visas is the opportunity to earn significantly higher salaries, according to Mr Chauhan. The US offers higher pay, and for someone who is the first in their family to achieve professional qualifications, earning that much can be life-changing. \"The fascination with H-1Bs is directly tied to the wage gap between India and the US for the same engineering roles,\" he says. But not everybody is happy with the programme. For many, the H-1B programme is an aspirational pathway for permanent residency or a US green card. While H-1B itself is a temporary work visa, it allows visa holders to live and work in the US for up to six years. During this time, many H-1B holders apply for a green card through employment-based immigration categories, typically sponsored by their employers. This takes time. More than a million Indians, including dependents, are currently waiting in employment-based green card categories. \"Getting a green card means signing up for an endless wait for 20-30 years,\" says Atal Agarwal, who runs a firm in India that uses AI to help find visa options globally for education and jobs. Mr Agarwal moved to the US after graduating in 2017 and worked at a software company for a few years. He says getting the H-1B visa was fairly straightforward, but then it seemed he had \"reached a dead end\". He returned to India. \"It's an unstable situation. Your employer has to sponsor you and since the pathway to a green card is so long, you are basically tied to them. If you lose your job, you only get 60 days to find a new one. Every person who is going on merit to the US should have a pathway to a green card within three to five years.\" This could be one reason that the visa programme has got tied up with immigration. \"H-1B is a high-skilled, worker mobility visa. It is not an immigration visa. But it gets clubbed with immigration and illegal immigration and becomes a sensitive issue,\" Shivendra Singh, vice president of global trade development at Nasscom, the Indian technology industry trade group, told the BBC.\n\nMany in the US believe the H-1B visa programme is flawed. They cite widespread fraud and abuse, especially by major Indian IT firms which are top recipients of these visas. In October, a US court found Cognizant guilty of discriminating against over 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022, though the company plans to appeal. Last week, Farah Stockman of The New York Times wrote that \"for more than a decade, Americans working in the tech industry have been systematically laid off and replaced by cheaper H-1B visa holders\". Mr. Singh of Nasscom argues that H-1B visa workers are not underpaid, as employers must pay them above the prevailing or actual wage of comparable US workers in the area. Companies also invest tens of thousands of dollars in legal and government fees for these costly visas. Also, it has not been a one-way traffic: Indian tech giants have hired and supported nearly 600,000 American workers and spent over a billion dollars on upskilling nearly three million students across 130 US colleges, according to Mr Singh. The Indian tech industry has prioritised US worker hiring and they bring employees on H-1B visas only when they are unable to find locals with the skills they need, he said.",

This development represents a major change in the entry process and will reshape the way people plan their journeys.\n\nThe ETA scheme emphasises the need for proper planning and compliance, with the introduction of new administrative requirements that businesses must address to avoid disruption to their operations.\n\nCHANGES TO SPONSORSHIP COSTS FOR SKILLED WORKERS\n\nThe UK government has implemented a significant policy shift regarding sponsorship costs for Skilled Workers. Effective December 31, 2024, sponsors are prohibited from passing on certain sponsorship costs to Skilled Workers. This change aims to address concerns about work-related debt and exploitation.\n\nPROHIBITED COSTS\n\nThe following costs are now prohibited from being passed on to Skilled Workers:\n\nSponsor Licence Fee: This includes the fee for new sponsor licence applications or adding the Skilled Worker route to an existing licence, submitted from December 31, 2024 onwards.\n\nThis includes the fee for new sponsor licence applications or adding the Skilled Worker route to an existing licence, submitted from December 31, 2024 onwards. Certificate of Sponsorship Fee: The fee for a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned on or after December 31, 2024 is also prohibited.\n\nThese prohibitions align with the existing rule against passing on the Immigration Skills Charge to workers. Other immigration-related costs, such as visa application fees, Home Office commercial partner service charges, and Immigration Health Surcharges, can still be recouped by the employer.\n\nPENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE\n\nNon-compliance with these new regulations can lead to the revocation of the sponsor licence. This can result in reputational damage, financial losses, and significant disruption for existing sponsored workers.\n\nACTIONS FOR EMPLOYERS\n\nEmployers should take the following steps to ensure compliance:\n\nReview and Update Policies: Review and update internal immigration policies and employment policies related to sponsorship costs.\n\nReview and update internal immigration policies and employment policies related to sponsorship costs. Review and Update Agreements: Review and update employment contracts, side letters, and \"clawback\" agreements related to sponsorship costs.\n\nReview and update employment contracts, side letters, and \"clawback\" agreements related to sponsorship costs. Budgetary Considerations: Assess the impact of these changes on the company\u2019s budget for immigration and its potential consequences for future recruitment and sponsorship.\n\nELECTRONIC TRAVEL AUTHORISATION SCHEME\n\nAs set out in our previous LawFlash, the ETA grants permission to travel to the United Kingdom\u2014similar to the US Electronic System for Travel Authorization. The ETA is applicable for UK visitors who do not need a visa for tourism, transit, visiting family and friends, business, or short-term study. It also applies for those coming to the United Kingdom for up to three months on the Creative Worker visa concession and for those coming for a permitted paid engagement.\n\nIt is not applicable for those who hold a UK visa, those with permission to reside to live, work, or study in the United Kingdom, or for British or Irish nationals.\n\nKEY DATES AND ELIGIBILITY\n\nThe scheme will be mandatory for non-European nationals, including US nationals, from January 8, 2025.\n\nThe scheme has been live since October 2023. The roll out dates are as follows:\n\nNon-European Nationals: As of November 27, 2024, eligible non-European nationals can apply for an ETA for travel to or transit through the United Kingdom from January 8, 2025.\n\nAs of November 27, 2024, eligible non-European nationals can apply for an ETA for travel to or transit through the United Kingdom from January 8, 2025. European Nationals: Eligible European nationals can apply from March 5, 2025, and will need an ETA from April 2, 2025.\n\nEligible European nationals can apply from March 5, 2025, and will need an ETA from April 2, 2025. Universal Requirement: From April 2025, all travellers to the United Kingdom (except British and Irish citizens) will need either an ETA or an eVisa.\n\nETA VS. VISA\n\nThe ETA is not a visa and does not grant the right to live or work in the United Kingdom. Visitors are still bound by the visitor visa rules and must comply with these regulations. Those needing to work in the United Kingdom must obtain the appropriate visa before traveling.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR BUSINESSES\n\nEmployers should review their travel needs for the next six to eight months to ensure affected overseas employees have the necessary ETAs. Failing to obtain an ETA can lead to delays or refusal of entry to the United Kingdom.\n\nEmployers may also wish to provide updates to their employees on the rollout of the scheme.\n\nEmployees should ensure that they have sufficient passport validity and ensure a timely submission of their ETA application. Employees should flag any concerns they may have about the application as soon as possible.\n\nEUROPEAN TRAVEL INFORMATION AND AUTHORISATION SYSTEM\n\nBusinesses should also be aware of the upcoming European Travel Information and Authorisation System, a similar system being implemented by the European Union. This will affect British nationals traveling to the Schengen Area. Travelers from over 60 visa-exempt countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada, will be impacted. Holders of valid Schengen visas will not require European Travel Information and Authorisation System authorisation.",

But the self-proclaimed democratic socialist sided with a wing of the incoming Trump administration last week, amplifying their criticisms about employment-based immigration, specifically the use of H-1B visas used to hire foreign professionals to fill specialty occupations.\n\n\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s supporters have split after he appointed Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American who favors bringing skilled immigrants to the United States, as his senior White House policy adviser on artificial intelligence. Vivek Ramaswamy, co-head of the newly organized Department of Government Efficiency, declared his support for employment-based immigration, calling it a necessary antidote to a culture that has \u201cvenerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, an immigration hardliner, bashed the H-1B program, which he claims allows wealthy elites to snub American workers.\n\n\n\nThe backlash has exposed tensions among Trump supporters about the costs and benefits of guest worker programs and whether the incoming administration should restrict legal immigration pathways. Proponents of the H-1B program argue it\u2019s one of the only viable paths for talented professionals from overseas to contribute to the U.S. economy. They say Congress and the executive branch should focus on streamlining cumbersome regulations and addressing decades-long green card backlogs. But critics warn the program is often misused when companies pass over eligible American workers in favor of less costly labor.\n\n\n\nRamaswamy\u2019s co-chairman, Elon Musk, said the H-1B program is essential for tech companies like Tesla, which ranks 16th in the lineup of companies employing the most H-1B visa holders. Musk, an immigrant from South Africa, claims he would not be in the United States without the visa, though details about his immigration journey remain unclear.\n\n\n\nSanders challenged Musk\u2019s comments, painting the H-1B visa program as a money-making scheme for billionaires and comparing visa holders to \u201cindentured servants\u201d who are paid low wages to replace \u201cgood-paying American jobs.\u201d\n\n\n\nCongress created the H-1B visa program in 1990. Companies may file petitions for high-skilled workers with \u201ctheoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\u201d U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services explains. Applicants must have already completed at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a field of study applicable to the potential role.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a program that is primarily very highly skilled people who are very highly compensated for their work,\u201d said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute. There are 85,000 spots available every year, 20,000 of which are reserved for individuals who graduated from a master\u2019s or doctorate program within the United States. (Institutions for higher education and nonprofits are not subject to the cap.)\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been filled basically every year that we\u2019ve had the 85,000 cap,\u201d Bier noted. If more applicants register than the number of available visa spots, the applications enter a lottery. The 2025 cap was filled on Dec. 2, 2024. According to Bier, applicants have about a 1 in 4 chance of being selected through the lottery.\n\n\n\nNikita Kothari remembers crying with her friends when she found out she wasn\u2019t selected from the lottery the first time her company filed her H-1B petition. \u201cI [thought] I would have to go back home,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\n\nKothari, 33, grew up in Bangalore, India, but has lived in the United States for about 10 years\u2014first as a master\u2019s student in Chicago and now in Durham, N.C., as a remote employee for an internet provider. She told me she left India because it offered only limited opportunities for individuals with electrical engineering degrees like hers. International students who graduate from a STEM program in the United States have up to three years to work in their field of study and obtain another visa.\n\n\n\nKothari became a Christian around the same time she accepted the role with her current company, and told me she learned to trust that God is sovereign\u2014even over administrative errors and visa lotteries. \u201c[The visa process] definitely stretched my faith in a lot of ways,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nWith one year left before she would have to leave the country, Kothari\u2019s company entered the H-1B lottery on her behalf for the second time in 2019. At 4 a.m. one morning, an email from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services landed in her inbox. She had been selected.\n\n\n\nThough the H-1B visa is a nonimmigrant visa category, recipients often use it as a stepping stone to permanent residency and ask their companies to sponsor employment-based green cards. Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow with the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation, said this wasn\u2019t how the program was intended to be used.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a de facto immigrant visa,\u201d said Hankinson, who interviewed H-1B applicants as a consular officer from 2000 to 2002.\n\n\n\nWORLD spoke with five H-1B visa holders working in technology or healthcare fields. Four of them emigrated to the United States from India, and all of them have already requested permanent residency.\n\n\n\nH-1B visas are granted for three years and may be renewed once. But many recipients end up staying on the visas for much longer due to backlogs impeding the green card process, especially for Indian and Chinese applicants, who regularly exceed the number of available spots. Immigration rules limit each nationality from receiving more than 7% of the 140,000 employment-based green cards each year.\n\n\n\nKrishnan, the Trump appointee, came to the United States from India in 2007 on an L-1 visa\u2014which enables an employer to temporarily transfer an employee from a foreign office to an office in the United States\u2014and is now a U.S. citizen.\n\n\n\nIndians received 72% of all of all H-1B visas approved in 2023, according to the Migration Policy Institute. As of August 2023, 63% of migrants stuck in the green card backlog were Indian, and new applicants face waits of up to 134 years. \u201cAs long as the green card system is capped the way it is, you\u2019re going to have a lot of people living on H-1B indefinitely,\u201d Bier added.\n\n\n\nRaj Karnatak, an infectious disease and critical care doctor in Milwaukee, Wis., has been on an H-1B visa since he arrived in the United States from New Delhi, India, in 2011. When we talked in June 2022, he told me he was waiting for a green card he\u2019d been approved for in 2015. I spoke with him again last week. He\u2019s still waiting\u2014though he recently changed to a category he hopes will progress more quickly.\n\n\n\nKarnatak wants to visit his aging parents back in India, but until he officially becomes a permanent resident, travel is risky, and he now has an 11-month-old son to consider. \u201cI may get stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is [my wife] going to take care of him alone?\u201d\n\n\n\nEmployers sponsoring an H-1B visa must file a labor condition application with the Department of Labor stating their requested H-1B employee is not displacing similarly qualified American workers and will be paid the prevailing wage in the industry. The whole visa process process may take up to eight months and cost employers between $1,250 to $4,500 in filing fees and even more in legal fees, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\n\n\nStill, critics of the visas say companies use the H-1B program to pass over American workers for cheaper substitutes instead of relieving genuine labor shortages. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank funded by labor unions, published a report showing outsourcing firms accounted for half of the top 30 H-1B employers in 2021.\n\n\n\nHankinson with the Heritage Foundation said he witnessed rampant fraud firsthand: cases where applicants weren\u2019t remotely qualified for the job or were hired by large outsourcing companies for jobs that didn\u2019t yet exist.\n\n\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute also noted that the top 30 H-1B employers collectively hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022, despite laying off at least 85,000 workers in 2022 and early 2023. On Sunday, the Austin American-Statesman reported that though Tesla laid off 10% of its global workforce in April, the company requested roughly 2,000 H-1B visas, according to a report from Electrek.\n\n\n\nStan Veuger, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, argued it\u2019s impossible to make a direct connection between a company laying someone off and then hiring an H-1B worker. That perspective stems from an economic viewpoint that some MAGA Republicans and democratic socialists like Sanders share, he said: \u201cThey believe that, if there\u2019s basically a fixed number of jobs, you bring in immigrants, they drive down wages.\u201d\n\n\n\nVeuger, originally from the Netherlands, formerly held an H-1B visa. \u201cPeople are a little casual about the existence of the program, as if there\u2019s all these alternatives that come with more flexibility or a more immediate path to permanent residency,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut H-1B visa holders are employed in some of the highest-earning areas of the country, he argued, and often end up complementing, not competing with, American-born workers. He warned that cutting the program would hurt American companies overall, who would in turn shrink their entire labor forces. \u201cYou\u2019ll see less innovation, fewer new American businesses,\u201d Veuger said.\n\n\n\nFollowing the online spat about the visas, Trump indicated in an interview with the New York Post that he supports the program, though during his first administration, he restricted access to the visas. \u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first Trump administration imposed visa and travel restrictions on H-1B applicants during 2020, so the number of admitted visa holders plummeted from 601,594 in fiscal year 2019 to 368,440 in 2020. Lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the tally to drop to 148,603 in 2021, but during 2023, 755,020 were admitted, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\n\n\nStill, Bier with the Cato Institute said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Trump restricts the program in some way once he takes office. \u201cIf he does that, then that\u2019s going to really decimate the program and prevent many skilled people from being able to stay in the United States,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "\u00bb The Platinum E3 Visa is no longer available.\n\nCredit One announced in December 2024 that the Platinum E3 Visa is closed to new applicants. Current cardholders can continue to use their cards.\n\nSeveral credit cards in Credit One\u2019s portfolio are targeted toward people with bad credit who want to improve their scores. Of those, the Platinum E3 Visa has one of the highest rewards rates, at 3%.\n\nDepending on your credit scores, though, that rate may come at a price \u2014 an annual fee of up to $99. Plus, the card's 3% rewards categories aren\u2019t necessarily representative of everyday expenses.\n\nEven if you have bad credit, it\u2019s possible to find cheaper and better options than the Platinum E3 Visa.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Credit One\u2019s Platinum E3 Visa.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Credit One (not to be confused with Capital One) offers multiple versions of its \"Platinum\" card, including the Credit One Platinum X5 Visa, which has different features and terms. For more information on the X5, see our review here.\n\n1. Annual fee is based on your credit score\n\nCredit One says the Platinum E3 Visa is meant for people who are building or rebuilding credit. If that\u2019s you, expect to pay a price for carrying the credit card. Cardholders with bad credit (credit scores of 629 or lower) will pay a $75 annual fee in the first year and $99 thereafter. The initial $75 annual fee is assessed upon account opening and immediately lowers your amount of available credit. After the first year, the $99 annual fee is billed in monthly increments of $8.25.\n\nBalking at a nearly $ 100 annual fee is a reasonable response when there are several other good cards for people with bad credit that don\u2019t cost a thing. Many of the best secured cards don\u2019t have an annual fee, though they do require an upfront, refundable security deposit.\n\nThe annual fees for the Platinum E3 card decrease the better your credit score is: Those with fair (aka average) credit \u2014 or credit scores from 630-689 \u2014 can expect a $39 annual fee. Credit cards for fair credit are somewhat limited, and as such, the Platinum E3 Visa isn't the worst you can do.\n\nThere\u2019s no annual fee if your credit is excellent, meaning a score of 720 or above. But then again, if you have excellent credit, there's little reason to apply for the Platinum E3 Visa. With an excellent credit score, you can qualify for credit cards that earn 5% cash back, travel credit cards with hundreds of dollars in bonuses or credits, or a balance transfer card that waives interest for more than a year.\n\n2. It earns rewards\n\nThe Platinum E3 Visa has a two-tiered rewards structure. It earns:\n\nUnlimited 3% cash back on streaming services, entertainment and ridesharing.\n\nUnlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases.\n\nCredit One counts movies, live theater and sporting events purchased through Ticketmaster as entertainment, but not amusement parks and sports tickets from the box office. Prime Video is excluded from the 3% rate on streaming.\n\nPlatinum E3 Visa cardholders can also get up to 10% back at select merchants, which as of this writing include places like Costco, Petco and CVS Health. Rewards are earned automatically without having to activate offers. Merchants change periodically, but cardholders can find the current list of eligible retailers by logging in to their accounts.\n\nRewards don\u2019t expire as long as the account is in good standing.\n\n3. Rewards can be redeemed for gift cards, among other things\n\nRedemption options include statement credit, gift cards, or eligible merchandise and services. Cardholders may choose to redeem rewards manually or automatically. However, statement credit is the only option if you opt for automatic redemption.\n\nThe minimum redemption amount for a statement credit is $10. For a gift card, it's $25.\n\n4. Credit lines start at $300\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nThe minimum credit line on the Platinum E3 Visa is $300. (Credit One didn't disclose the maximum credit limit.) Remember, though, that any annual fee will be charged upon account opening and thus will immediately reduce the amount of available credit.\n\nIf you need more spending power, consider a card like the Varo credit card or Chime Secured Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card. Credit limits on both cards are determined by the amount of money you have in a linked spending account.\n\nCredit One regularly reviews cardholders\u2019 accounts to see whether they are eligible for a credit line increase.\n\nSee more from Chime\u00ae Chime says the following: The secured Chime Credit Builder Visa\u00ae Credit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted. Please see the back of your card for its issuing bank.\n\nTo apply for Credit Builder, you must have an active Chime\u00ae Checking Account. Based on a representative study conducted by Experian\u00ae in January 2024, members who made their first purchase with Credit Builder between June 2022 and October 2022 observed an average FICO\u00ae Score 8 increase of 30 points after approximately 8 months.

            "content": "Amid recent infighting on the social media site X between MAGA Republicans and Silicon Valley tech leaders like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy over immigration, attention quickly centered on a visa program used by highly skilled workers. Musk and his allies defended the H-1B visas that have been the backbone of their industry while the likes of Laura Loomer, a Trump-allied political activist, argued that the visas were contrary to \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies.\n\nBut what are H-1B visas anyway?\n\nThe specialty occupation visa.\n\nThe H-1B visa is a temporary visa that a U.S. employer may request to fill a specialty occupation with a foreign worker. To qualify as a specialty occupation, a position must usually require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in a specific field. Common H-1B occupations include software engineers, data scientists, and architects, among others.\n\nH-1B visas are typically issued for three years initially, but they can be extended for up to three additional years. However, if the employee has applied for permanent residency via an employment-based green card but is awaiting green card availability due to nationality restrictions, H-1B status can be extended beyond the usual six-year limit.\n\nEvery year 85,000 initial H-1B visas are up for grabs, including 20,000 visas reserved for individuals who have earned a master\u2019s degree or higher from a U.S. institution. Because of the limited availability of H-1B visas, recipients are chosen by lottery after being registered by the employer. Lottery registrations regularly exceed annual visa allocations, so registrants are chosen at random to submit a full petition for adjudication.\n\nRegistration numbers dropped significantly in last year\u2019s lottery due to changes in the registration process, but U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) still received over 470,000 registrations, of which only around 135,000 were invited to submit a full petition. The new process aimed to disincentivize unscrupulous employers from trying to game the system by submitting multiple registrations on behalf of the same employee. In the fiscal year 2024 lottery, before this change was made, USCIS received over 780,000 registrations, including over 400,000 on behalf of people with multiple registrations.\n\nInstitutions of higher education, their affiliated nonprofit entities, nonprofit research organizations, and government research organizations are exempt from the annual cap and can sponsor H-1B visas for foreign employees without competing in the annual lottery.\n\nEfforts to protect American workers.\n\nEmployers seeking to hire foreign workers through the H-1B program have to attest that doing so does not harm American workers. These attestations are submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) after a registrant is chosen in the lottery and are required before USCIS makes a determination regarding the merits of an H-1B visa petition.\n\nEmployers must attest that there is not a strike or labor lockout happening in their company at the time of the application. They must confirm that they will notify union representatives and/or employees that a visa application has been filed with DOL, and they must attest that the working conditions\u2014including the hours, shifts, vacations, and benefits\u2014provided to the foreign worker will not negatively affect the working conditions of Americans in similar positions. The employer must also agree to pay the H-1B worker a wage that is at least equal to the wage of its U.S. workers in similar positions or equal to the DOL-designated prevailing wage for that occupation in that location, whichever is greater. The median salary of approved H-1B beneficiaries in fiscal year 2023 was $118,000, according to USCIS. The Labor Department reviews these attestations for completeness and compliance before certifying the application and allowing the employer to proceed.\n\nMost employers also have to pay a fee, ranging from $750 to $1,500 per H-1B petition, to satisfy the requirements of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act. The fees go to grants to help fund training programs for U.S. citizens to prepare them for skilled jobs and thereby reduce American dependence on foreign labor. For example, during the COVID pandemic, such programs trained Americans to address rural health care shortages. In 2023, the grants directed $94 million to training programs intended to boost the pipeline of American workers in advanced manufacturing and information technology fields.\n\nSoaring demand for the H-1B program.\n\nDespite efforts aiming to reduce dependence on foreign labor and the many requirements that participating employers must satisfy to bring in workers on H-1B visas, demand for these visas still regularly exceeds the program\u2019s capacity. Why is there so much demand?\n\nThe H-1B program has played a critical role in the U.S. immigration system for decades in part because it is one of the only employment pathways available to foreign graduates of American universities who want to stay and work in this country. International students represent nearly 80 percent of graduate students in computer science at U.S. universities, so it is no surprise that computer-related occupations, including computer systems analysts, software engineers, and software developers, accounted for 65 percent of approved H-1B petitions in fiscal year 2023. At current enrollment rates, American universities are not producing enough domestic graduates to meet industry demand, so the H-1B becomes a pipeline to fill the gap.\n\nDemand for the H-1B also remains high because very little of the employment-based immigration system has been adjusted to meet modern needs. Statutory H-1B allocations have not increased since 2004 though incremental changes have been made through regulation to accommodate some additional demand. For instance, on December 18, 2024, the Department of Homeland Security finalized a rule that clarified visa cap exemptions for certain nonprofit organizations, exempting an additional 0.3 to 0.8 percent of H-1B petitioners from the annual lottery.\n\nConstraints in other parts of the immigration system also maintain the high demand for H-1B visas, particularly among Indian nationals. Each year, about 140,000 green cards are made available through the employment system, and no country\u2019s nationals may receive more than a combined 7 percent of family and employment-based green cards. Indian nationals must often wait several years longer than nationals of other countries before qualifying for an employment-based green card. Indian nationals made up over 72 percent of approved H-1B beneficiaries in fiscal year 2023. While some of this may be the result of Indian nationals\u2019 prevalence in American universities, it is more likely a side effect of these country caps on the employment-based green card process.\n\nAs mentioned previously, individuals can usually extend their H-1B visa beyond the six-year limit if they are in the queue for an employment-based green card. Therefore, while other foreign nationals may cycle off of the H-1B visa because anyone needed long-term in the U.S. would likely have the opportunity to obtain a green card, Indian nationals are much more likely to stay on the H-1B for several years while they await green card availability. Due to these uncapped extensions, the H-1B program had more than 610,000 active beneficiaries as of the last estimate in 2019.\n\nWaiting on Congress.",

Musk and his allies defended the H-1B visas that have been the backbone of their industry while the likes of Laura Loomer, a Trump-allied political activist, argued that the visas were contrary to \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies.\n\nBut what are H-1B visas anyway?\n\nThe specialty occupation visa.\n\nThe H-1B visa is a temporary visa that a U.S. employer may request to fill a specialty occupation with a foreign worker. To qualify as a specialty occupation, a position must usually require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in a specific field. Common H-1B occupations include software engineers, data scientists, and architects, among others.\n\nH-1B visas are typically issued for three years initially, but they can be extended for up to three additional years. However, if the employee has applied for permanent residency via an employment-based green card but is awaiting green card availability due to nationality restrictions, H-1B status can be extended beyond the usual six-year limit.\n\nEvery year 85,000 initial H-1B visas are up for grabs, including 20,000 visas reserved for individuals who have earned a master\u2019s degree or higher from a U.S. institution. Because of the limited availability of H-1B visas, recipients are chosen by lottery after being registered by the employer. Lottery registrations regularly exceed annual visa allocations, so registrants are chosen at random to submit a full petition for adjudication.\n\nFull article here.",

            "content": "The MAGA camp is divided over the question of visas for highly skilled workers, but the corporate media never digs deep into the real issues at stake. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are advocating more H-1B visa admissions, while anti-immigrant hardliners like Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon stand opposed. | Photos: AP / Design: PW\n\nIn the latest effort to divide the working class along national and racial lines, a heated political and ideological battle has ignited between Republican President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA allies over the H-1B visa program.\n\nThe framing of the \u201cdebate\u201d comes in the context of a rightward shift across corporate media after Trump\u2019s re-election\u2014either in terms of ultra-right demagogy or bending over backwards to accommodate Corporate America\u2014and many facts about the nature of the guest worker program have been lost in the weeds.\n\nThat\u2019s no accident. Ever polarizing, the mainstream press has focused on generating outrage and hyping up division, with little attention to the real issues at stake behind the supposed debate. Hesitant to spill any information which could threaten ruling class profits, the media instead opts to frame the debate as a false choice between the camps of \u201cpro-immigrant\u201d and \u201canti-immigrant,\u201d or \u201cright\u201d versus \u201cleft.\u201d\n\nThe whole effort serves to divert attention away from the real root causes of the H-1B dilemma and the complex challenge they present for the working class.\n\nMAGA factionalism\n\nThe H-1B visa program was established under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and later modified by the Immigration Act of 1990. The program provides work authorization for migrant workers in occupations for which enough U.S. workers supposedly cannot be found, typically those requiring advanced education, like computer sciences, information technology, and software development. It is the largest temporary work visa program, with nearly 600,000 workers currently in the U.S. in this category.\n\nElon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the tech and pharmaceutical billionaires chosen to lead the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump, are at odds with ultra-right, anti-immigrant Trump advisors such as Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon, who\u2019ve long advocated sealing the border.\n\nMusk, the richest person in the world, has spoken out in favor of H-1B visas and said he will \u201cgo to war\u201d over this issue. Ramaswamy, in an X post that originally lit the fire, complained that Americans are simply not \u201cgood enough\u201d when it comes to competing with foreign workers in the technology sector and that\u2019s why he backs expanding H-1B admissions. He blamed the \u201cdumbed-down\u201d culture of the U.S. as the main culprit\u2014sending the \u201cAmerica First\u201d section of the MAGA coalition into a frenzy.\n\nEver eager to please his billionaire backers, Trump\u2014who in 2016 pledged to eliminate \u201crampant, widespread\u201d abuse of \u201cH-1B as a cheap labor program\u201d\u2014said recently: \u201cI have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program.\u201d\n\nBig Tech exploits H-1B visa program for profit\n\nOriginally meant to fill U.S. labor market shortages with skilled foreign workers, the H-1B visa program has diverged from its initial purpose over the years. Rather than plugging holes and raising economic standards, in many ways the program has become a disaster for visa holders and U.S.-born workers alike.\n\nThe corporations that rely most heavily on the program\u2014such as Tata Consulting Services, Infosys, Cognizant Tech Solutions, and others\u2014have an outsourcing business model that exploits the program by underpaying migrant workers, who have virtually no labor rights. H-1B incentivizes corporations away from seeking qualified workers in the U.S. who are looking for higher pay. It has been criticized as a \u201cjob laundering\u201d program and a form of \u201cindentured servitude.\u201d\n\nA glaring example of the exploitative nature of the H-1B visa program was seen in 2015, when 250 Disney workers were told that they would be laid off. Many of their jobs were transferred to migrants on temporary visas for \u201chighly skilled technical workers,\u201d or the H-1B visa. Over the next three months, some Disney workers were required to train their replacements to do the jobs they had just lost.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe they could fly people in to sit at our desks and take over our jobs exactly,\u201d one former worker told The New York Times. \u201cIt was so humiliating to train somebody else to take over your job. I still can\u2019t grasp it.\u201d\n\nMusk has been using his newfound influence in the Trump coalition to push for increasing the cap on H-1B visa recipients. His Tesla corporation, like the tech consultancy firms, has relied heavily on H-1B to trim its costs and boost profits. In late 2024, Tesla ramped up its use of H-1B visas to replace the U.S.-born workers it let go during a wave of layoffs earlier in the year.\n\nRoughly 15,000 workers were made jobless at Tesla last spring, with every department reportedly impacted. Current and former workers at Tesla said that many of the laid-off U.S. workers were replaced by H-1B visa holders. They said that many workers let go were senior engineers with higher pay; they\u2019ve been replaced with junior engineers at significantly lower pay rates.\n\nAmazon, one of the world\u2019s largest corporations, ranked first for a number of years recently in terms of both new H-1B workers and layoffs. In 2022, the company hired 6,400 new H-1B workers and almost the same number the year before, with nearly 6,200 brought on board. But the company is also looking at laying off 27,150 workers, more than double the total number of H-1B workers they hired in 2021 and 2022 combined. Amazon\u2019s owner and multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos is now an ally of Trump, seen wining-and-dining at private events with the incoming president.\n\nGoogle and Meta, both tech giants and virtual monopolies in their own right, have been top H-1B employers for many years, bringing in over 3,100 new H-1B workers last year. Meta has such a large number of H-1B workers that it has classified itself as an \u201cH-1B dependent\u201d corporation in government filings because over 15% of its U.S. workforce consists of H-1B workers. Google and Meta jointly laid off 33,000 workers in 2022, almost 11 times the quantity of new H-1B workers they hired.\n\nWeak labor protections at the heart of program\u2019s failures\n\nCorporations, in the pursuit of maximum profit, exploit the guest-worker recipients through lower wages and precarious working conditions. U.S. law leaves them minimal economic and political rights and prevents them from seeking new job opportunities or advocating for better working conditions.\n\n\u201cThe main function of the H-1B visa program and other guest worker initiatives is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ind-Vt. in a statement. \u201cThe cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.\u201d\n\nSanders highlighted that during the years 2022 and 2023, the top 30 corporations utilizing this program laid off at least 85,000 U.S.-born workers while they brought on board over 34,000 new H-1B guest workers. Estimations suggest that up to 33% of all recent Information Technology job openings in the nation are being filled by guest workers.\n\nFurthermore, according to U.S. Census Bureau information, millions of Americans with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are not currently working in those fields. As many as 74% of such graduates are not employed in the sector they trained for.\n\nTeamsters General President Sean O\u2019Brien said on X that \u201cSenator Sanders is 100% right. The H-1B guest worker visa program displaces U.S. workers and allows billionaire tech employers to exploit foreign workers.\u201d\n\nRather than using the H-1B program only as a last resort when U.S. workers are not available, many corporations hire H-1B workers because they can be paid less and are essentially tied to the employer who sponsored their application\u2014hence the indentured servitude descriptor.\n\n\u201cWe must stand against worker exploitation in all forms, be it American workers, workers overseas, or immigrant workers here in America,\u201d said labor-backed former Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner. \u201cThe ruling class wants cheap labor and will game any system to secure it.\u201d\n\nMost H-1B workers are vastly underpaid, earning less than the market average for their occupation and location. According to a study done by the Economic Policy Institute, 60% of H-1B positions certified by the U.S. Department of Labor are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the same occupation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, current DOL rules allow for large-scale wage theft of H-1B workers. In a 2021 study, EPI found that thousands of skilled migrants employed by HCL Technologies\u2014an India-based IT staffing firm that places H-1B workers at corporations like Disney, FedEx, and Google\u2014were underpaid by at least $95 million.\n\nGuest-worker programs operate outside of standard labor laws, allowing corporations to employ a workforce that has few of the protections afforded to citizens and permanent residents. And since corporations aren\u2019t required to test the U.S. labor market to see if any workers are available before hiring an H-1B worker, or pay their H-1B workers a fair wage, corporations have exploited the program.\n\nWhen H-1B workers are laid off, they are under immense pressure to find a new employer to support their visa within a strict 60-day timeframe, or else face potential deportation from the U.S. The fear of being forced to leave serves as a powerful tool to prevent workplace organizing and encourages compliance with management orders.\n\nIn effect, the precarity of these workers and their conditions lower the labor standards for all workers in their respective fields.\n\nAs capitalism\u2019s chief critic, Karl Marx, pointed out, the system\u2019s mode of production leads to the elimination of \u201cspecialized\u201d labor and a general reduction of wages and conditions of life for the entire working class to the same low level. The H-1B visa gives corporations the power to dilute the bargaining power of workers who have special education and training, driving down pay and security for everyone\u2014U.S.- or foreign-born\u2014in the interest of profit. It allows companies to shift the labor market\u2019s supply and demand equation for their benefit.\n\nAnother benefit to monopoly corporations is the \u201cbrain drain\u201d of other countries, whereby the workers who could produce in their countries and contribute to economic development there are being used up and exploited here in service to Corporate America.\n\nMAGA doesn\u2019t really care about U.S.-born workers\n\nThe ultra-nationalist section of the MAGA coalition, represented in Trump\u2019s circles by people like Bannon and Miller, are demagogically using the discourse around the H-1B program\u2014along with the justified criticisms of it\u2014as a battering ram against all immigration and immigrant workers in general.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Bannon and Miller raised the same grievances, alleging that \u201clegal immigration is the real problem\u201d for the economy. They deceptively try to portray themselves as defenders of U.S.-born workers.\n\nLast week, Bannon warned Musk that he and other MAGA fanatics are going to \u201crip his face off\u201d unless Musk \u201csmartens up\u201d and stops pushing visas for foreign workers to \u201ctake jobs from Americans.\u201d\n\nWith the incoming administrating threat ening the \u201clargest deportation operation in the history of the U.S.,\u201d this latest maneuver by the ultra-right around the H-1B program only contributes to the negative ideological influences of nativism, jingoism, and nationalism on the working class. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain has warned that MAGA and the capitalist class are preparing to \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d and \u201cleave with all the loot\u201d while pretending to care about U.S. workers.\n\nGeorgi Dimitrov, an anti-fascist leader of the 1930s, explained the ideological influence of fascism on the masses of working people:\n\n\u201cFascism aims at the most unbridled exploitation of the masses, but it approaches them with the most artful anti-capitalist demagogy, taking advantage of the deep hatred of the working people against the plundering bourgeoisie, the banks, trusts, and financial magnates, and advancing those slogans which at the given moment are most alluring to the politically immature masses.\u201d\n\nThe fact of the matter is that these ideologues of the capitalist class don\u2019t actually care about U.S.-born workers, or the working class in general. They are staunch opponents of basic civil rights such as the right to vote, let alone union and labor rights, women\u2019s rights, LGBTQ rights, or the rights of racial and ethnic minorities. It\u2019s yet another instance of fascists using the grievances of the working class, paying lip service to them, dressing them up in an \u201canti-capitalist\u201d veneer, and turning them on their head for capitalism\u2019s benefit.\n\nAs corporations struggle to maintain and expand their profits, we\u2019re also seeing an increase in the exploitation of other guest-worker programs, such as H-2A and H-2B visas. There is widespread abuse, especially in meatpacking and poultry, of these programs, leading to human trafficking and the abuse of migrant workers\u2014even children\u2014in the process.\n\nFor workers laboring in these industries worried about deportation and visa loss, many choose not to raise their voices or unionize their shop. It\u2019s the same situation faced by workers in the H-1B visa program\u2014but at even more precarious wage levels and working conditions.\n\nThe more hesitant these vulnerable workers are to organize, the more likely corporations will be to continue putting the squeeze on working conditions and wages for all workers.\n\nThe working class response\n\nThe labor movement and its allies have to contend with the reality of the situation facing the working class of our country. While the response of the ultra-right in this discourse is to put blame on the recipients of H-1Bs and drive wedges between workers, the working class response is to fight for stronger political and economic democracy for working people\u2014whether they be domestic, permanent, temporary, or migrant workers\u2014including but not limited to the guaranteed right to organize at the workplace, fair and equal wages for equal work, and dignity on the job.\n\nThe lack of good-paying jobs, rising debt, and the lack of productive work has led to widespread precarity, depression, and anger amongst the U.S. working class. As household and college debt continue to pile up, workers are increasingly having to work underemployed and low-wage jobs, while the capitalist class exploits the H-1B program to pay lower wages for what were once considered higher-wage jobs.\n\nThe ultra-right demagogically uses the deteriorating conditions of life for working people not to criticize the system of capitalism but to place the blame for the ills of the system on marginalized sections of the class.\n\nThe presence of weak labor laws makes it very profitable for corporations to prioritize hiring H-1B workers over U.S.-born workers, not only because of their exceptional skills but due to the reduction in payroll costs and their indentured relationship with employers. For capitalism, it\u2019s all about profit and maximizing it.\n\n\u201cWe must significantly raise the minimum wage for guest workers, allow them to easily switch jobs,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt should never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker.\u201d\n\nThe EPI recommends changing the rules of the H-1B program to force companies to pay visa holders wages that are higher than the U.S. median. This would disincentivize the corporate practice of hiring H-1B workers as a cost-cutting measure to fill positions with lower wages. Moreover, closing the exploitative loophole that fuels the outsourcing business model and enforcing prevailing wage laws for H-1B workers would ensure fair pay and discourage corporations from undermining U.S. wage standards.\n\nThe threat of lay-offs, and thus deportation of migrant workers and their families, must be challenged head-on by the labor movement and its allies. Many H-1B vias holders have deep ties to the U.S., especially in their local communities, and are likely to have U.S.-born children. Can they be seen as a force separate from the whole of the American working class?\n\nAt minimum, the H-1B program needs reform\u2014the guest workers must be allowed to switch jobs within the field they were received under; they must enjoy the same labor rights and protections as other workers; and they must be allowed to organize without fear of retaliation. The initial solution lies in working class unity and solidarity and refraining from playing into Corporate America\u2019s \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d tactics.\n\nAs with all opinion and news-analysis articles published by People\u2019s World, the views reflected here are those of the authors.\n\nPeople\u2019s World, we believe news and information should be free and accessible to all, but we need your help.

            "content": "The global mobility divide is widening significantly. As the Henley Passport Index January 2025 edition reveals, global travel freedom has nearly doubled from 58 visa-free destinations in 2006 to 111 in 2025, but the gap between the most and least mobile nations has reached unprecedented levels. As Dr. Christian H. Kaelin has highlighted, \u201cThe global mobility gap between those at the top and bottom of the index is now wider than it has ever been, with top-ranked Singapore able to access a record-breaking 169 more destinations visa-free than Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThis growing mobility disparity is particularly evident in Schengen visa application outcomes. My 2024 research revealed that African applicants face significantly higher rejection rates than the global average. These rejection rates, largely driven by passport power and identity-based visa policies, have more than doubled over the past decade and create substantial barriers to economic mobility for African citizens.\n\nKey findings in Schengen visa rejections\n\nIn this edition, following up on my previous analysis, I present three key findings from a data-driven1 comparison of Schengen visa rejection rates between African and Asian countries.2\n\nFirst, African applicants face consistently higher rejection rates than their Asian and global peers. In 2023, despite submitting half as many applications as those from Asia, African applicants were twice as likely to be rejected, with rates 14 percentage points higher than Asian applicants.\n\nSecond, while the strength of the applicant\u2019s passport based on the Henley Passport Index and Henley Passport Power Index, as well as reciprocity agreements, are key factors in Schengen visa access, the variation in rejection rates between regions and nationalities goes beyond economic considerations. Discriminatory policies driven by identity-based electoral processes, broad discretionary powers of immigration officials, and visa sanctions against countries deemed uncooperative in readmitting irregular migrants contribute to higher rejection rates for certain nationalities, ultimately reducing legal mobility.\n\nThird, these regional disparities between the Global North and Global South, and between Africa and Asia, reveal how visa policies contribute to a rapidly widening mobility gap in a world where travel freedom is expanding selectively, creating a system where some nationalities enjoy greater mobility while barriers grow for others.\n\nSchengen discrimination in numbers\n\nTable 1. World Top 10 Countries with Highest Schengen Visa Rejection Rates in 2023\n\nSource: Compiled by Author using data from European Commission \u2013 Migration and Home Affairs, May 2024\n\nAmong the top 10 countries facing the highest Schengen visa rejection rates illustrated in Table 1, six are in Africa. Comoros leads with a 61.3% rejection rate, followed by Guinea-Bissau at 51%, Ghana at 47.5%, Mali at 46.1%, Sudan at 42.3%, and Senegal at 41.2%. Three Asian countries and a European country complete the list: Pakistan with 49.6%, Syria with 46%, and Bangladesh with 43.3%. Greece, despite being a European Union member and part of Europe\u2019s Schengen area, holds the second-highest rejection rate at 56.4%. Although not in the global top 10, it is worth highlighting the UAE, which the UN classifies as an Asian country, where European consulates reported a 22.8% rejection rate in 2023, placing it among Asia\u2019s highest. These high rejection rates in Greece and the UAE are largely attributed to applications from non-citizens of the countries.\n\nSchengen visa rejection rates vary significantly between the countries with the highest rejection rates and the global average. In 2023, the top 10 countries globally faced a 48.5% rejection rate, despite accounting for only 2.7% of all applications. Similarly, the top 10 African countries, while submitting only 2.8% of global Schengen visa applications, faced a rejection rate of 44.8%. Half of the 277,792 applicants from the top 10 countries with the highest rejections were denied visas. Although these countries represent just 2.7% of total applications, the rejection rate of 48.5% \u2014 almost one in two applications \u2014 stands in sharp contrast to the global average, where only one in six from a total of over 10 million applications is rejected.\n\nTable 2. Top 20 African and Asian Countries with Highest Schengen Visa Rejection Rates in 2023 by Percentage\n\nSource: Compiled by Author using data from European Commission \u2013 Migration and Home Affairs, May 2024\n\nLooking at broader regional patterns in 2023, as Table 2 reveals, the top 20 countries in Africa and Asia submitted 703,894 applications, representing 6.8% of all Schengen visa applications, of which 40% were rejected. The top 10 African countries faced particularly high rejection rates, with applicants experiencing a 45% rejection rate, higher than the combined Africa\u2013Asia average of 40% (see Table 3).\n\nTable 3. Total Schengen Visa Applications 2013\u20132023: Comparing Africa, Asia, and Global\n\nSource: Compiled by Author using data from European Commission - Migration and Home Affairs, May 2024\n\nTable 3 shows that while in 2013, African applicants faced a rejection rate of 18% \u2014 13 percentage points higher than the global rate of 5%, by 2023, the rejection rate for African applicants had risen to 27%, 11 percentage points higher than the global average of 16%. The 10-year difference in rejection rate of 2 percentage points shows a slight narrowing of the gap between African and global Schengen visa rejection rates.\n\nThe rejection rate for Schengen visa applications from Africa increased from 18% in 2013 to 27% in 2023 \u2014 a 9-percentage point rise, while, the global rejection rate increased by 11 percentage points, from 5% in 2013 to 16% in 2023. In a nutshell, the likelihood of African applicants for Schengen visas being rejected is 11% higher than the global average.\n\nThe contrast between regional Schengen visa rejection rates is striking. Over the period 2013 to 2023, rejection rates increased across regions, with African rates rising by 9% and Asian rates by 7%, following the global trend of an 11% increase.\n\nGraph 1. Schengen Visa Applications 2013\u20132023, Absolute Number and Rejection Rate: Comparing Africa, Asia, and Global\n\nSource: Compiled by Author using data from European Commission \u2013 Migration and Home Affairs, May 2024\n\nGraph 1 illustrates that between 2013 and 2023, the total number of Schengen visa applicants from Asia (5.9 million) was more than double that of applicants from Africa (2.5 million). However, the rejection rate for applications from Africa (27%) was more than double that of those from Asia (13%). The disparity is clear in the annual figures shown in Table 2: in 2013, 18% of applications from Africa were rejected, compared to only 6% of applications from Asia. By 2023, the gap between African and Asian rejection rates widened, with African rejections rising to 27% compared to Asia\u2019s 13%, despite Asia submitting 3.4 million more applications. The gap between African and Asian rejection rates grew from a difference of 12 percentage points in 2013 to one of 14 percentage points in 2023 \u2014 an increase in disparity of 2 percentage points. This growing gap in Schengen visa rejection rates reflects the broader pattern of global mobility inequality, placing African citizens at a greater disadvantage in accessing economic opportunities.\n\nGraph 2. Schengen Visa Rejection Rates 2013 vs 2023 in Percentage: Comparing Africa, Asia, and Global\n\nSource: Compiled by Author using data from European Commission \u2013 Migration and Home Affairs, May 2024\n\nAs Graph 2 illustrates, in 2013, Asian applicants faced a rejection rate just 1 percentage point higher than the global rate of 5%. However, by 2023, the rejection rate for Asian applicants rose to 13% \u2014 3 percentage points lower than the increased global rate of 16%.\n\nAs mentioned above, the cases of the UAE and Greece (a member of the European Union) demonstrate that rejection rates are more closely tied to the nationality and identity of the applicants rather than their economic status. In 2023, despite being one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations, the UAE saw a 22.8% rejection rate for its 233,932 Schengen visa applications (2.3% of global applications). Notably, over 90% of these rejections were for non-Emirati UAE residents, including applicants from Egypt, India, Jordan, Philippines, Russia, and South Africa. Similarly, Greece, a member of Europe\u2019s Schengen area, recorded a striking 56.4% rejection rate for the 4,894 applications made in the country, most of which were made by non-Greek residents or tourists.\n\nBeyond economics: Analyzing Schengen visa rejection patterns\n\nSeveral factors explain the variation in rejection rates between regions and countries. The disparities in Schengen visa access can be significantly explained by the Henley Passport Index and Henley Passport Power Index, where the main determinants of visa access are the GDP per capita of the nationality and the bilateral agreements and free movement policies in place among countries. However, the differences observed cannot be justified and fully explained by economic factors and reciprocity agreements alone. Identity politics, far-right political influence, and fears about demographic changes play significant roles, alongside historical migration patterns and cultural diversity concerns.\n\nMigration policy has become a primary tool for addressing domestic political pressures driven by anti-immigration sentiments. Discriminatory policies often emerge from electoral processes dominated by identity politics and the desire to maintain specific socio-cultural demographics in destination countries. Such policies manifest in the discretionary power of immigration officials to assess the credibility of applicants and their intention to return. Additionally, the visa sanctions regime, which imposes longer processing times for countries deemed uncooperative in the return and readmission of nationals staying irregularly in Europe, also contributes to reduced legal mobility and potentially higher rejection rates.\n\nHowever, irregular stay rates alone fail to explain high rejection rates. For example, 35.5% of applications from Malta are rejected despite the country having only 147 irregular migrants per 100,000 residents, compared to Slovenia, which has 1,667 irregular migrants per 100,000 and a rejection rate of 17.4%.\n\nGraph 3. Africa\u2019s Leading Trade Partners, 2019\u20132021\n\nSource: Compiled by Author based on data from Afreximbank and IMF\n\nRestrictive visa policies undermine Africa\u2013EU mobility\n\nBetween 2013 and 2023, the number of global Schengen visa applications fell by 40.13% (from 17.3 million to 10.3 million), while visa fees increased by 50% (from EUR 60 to EUR 90), and rejection rates rose by 12%. Contrary to this global trend, as shown in Table 3, African applications increased by 22.41% (from 2.02 to 2.47 million), despite facing consistently higher rejection rates than other regions, particularly Asia.\n\nThese high rejection rates contradict established migration theories and existing Africa\u2013European Union migration partnership agreements. Various factors and migration theories suggest there should be robust mobility between Africa and Europe: high trade volume (the European Union remains Africa\u2019s leading trading partner), geographic proximity, demographic complementarity, historical connections, and linguistic ties. Migration theories including network theory, as discussed by Massey et al. (1993), demonstrate how African migrant networks typically help lower migration costs and risks by providing social capital that facilitates movement. The Gravity Model of Migration developed by Stewart (1948) suggests that migration volume between regions should be inversely proportional to the distance between them, thus higher mobility should exist between Europe and Africa. Additionally, the Demographic Transition Theory by Thompson (1929) and Notestein (1945) points to demographic complementarity between the regions, as population growth and changing age structures create natural migration pressures where Europe\u2019s demographic decline and Africa\u2019s youthful demography would be expected to complement each other.\n\nMoreover, while the European Union, though declining as shown in Graph 3, remains Africa\u2019s leading trading partner, legal mobility of Africans to Europe is, paradoxically, increasingly restricted. The promise of legal mobility from Africa to Europe, which has been a critical demand from Africa and a pillar of the Africa\u2013Europe partnership on migration and mobility, remains as elusive as Godot.\n\nWhat is more, current European Union migration policies appear to increase both the human and economic costs of travel to Europe, whether through regular or irregular channels. This is evidenced by the fact that the Central and Western Mediterranean have been the deadliest migration routes in the world, along with ever-increasing Schengen visa fees and associated costs.\n\nInstead, current visa policies increase both human and economic costs of travel to Europe, contributing to the already declining share of trade, and reducing educational and cultural exchanges. These restrictive policies, driven by domestic and geopolitical identity politics and ideological considerations, contradict the European Union\u2019s commitment in the African Union\u2013European Union partnership to take concrete actions and allocate resources to expand legal migration pathways. Consequently, they are widening the mobility gap, and particularly disadvantaging African nationals.\n\nNotes\n\n1 The data for this piece is mainly taken from Migration and Home Affairs \u2013 European Commission. 2024. \u201cShort-stay visas issued by Schengen countries\u201d.

Initial changes to the AEWV aimed to control net migration and reduce migrant exploitation. Operational improvements have since increased productivity and speed up processing times. Key changes effective from March 2025 include:\n\nReducing the minimum experience requirement for lower-skilled migrants to two years.\n\nIncreasing visa duration for new applicants in Level 4-5 roles from two to three years.\n\nExtending interim work rights to AEWV applicants from any work or student visa type.\n\nThe domestic workforce threshold for specific construction roles is reduced from 35% to 15%.\n\nAmending the labor market test to a declaration-based model.\n\nAdjusting the income threshold for AEWV holders supporting a dependent child from NZ$43,322 to NZ$55,844.\n\nAdditionally, two new seasonal visas will be introduced in late 2025 to address specific sector needs. The Job Check step of the AEWV process will also be redesigned for greater efficiency. These changes aim to attract higher-skilled workers, manage migration levels responsibly and ensure New Zealand has the skills needed for economic growth.\n\nContent in this publication is for informational purposes only and not intended as legal advice, nor should it be relied on as such.

            "content": "Being banned from Thailand made me realize I need to pay better attention to even the smallest details when traveling.\n\nI traveled for the first time when I was 12 years old. My mother is from Mombasa, Kenya, and wanted my brother and me to meet our family and experience our Kenyan heritage. She sent us as unaccompanied minors from Chicago to Kenya, where we stayed for two years.\n\nThat trip instilled a love of travel in my soul. I started traveling again as an adult at 21 years old. I\u2019m a business owner who owns a consultancy. An event in Sydney, Australia, invited me to speak, and I almost broke my keyboard typing, \u201cYES, I\u2019m in.\u201d I got to fly on Virgin Atlantic for the first time, where a bar was in the middle of the Upper Class. From that first trip at 12 to taking pictures in Sydney Harbor at 21, travel has been a way of life\u2014I\u2019ve traveled to 88 countries thus far. I\u2019ve taken trips as part of my business, for pleasure, and some that combined both.\n\nIn 2019, after our last child left for college, my wife and I sold all our material possessions to become full-time digital nomads. We\u2019ve lived in Rome, Lisbon, Nice, Medellin, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and the Dominican Republic.\n\nWe\u2019ve done meticulous research on being accurate with visas, entry and exit requirements, what we need to know about the countries we\u2019re traveling to, and any other details we need to know as we\u2019ve traveled full-time.\n\nContinue Reading Article After Our Video Recommended Fodor\u2019s Video\n\nWhen I tell you I\u2019m a travel expert, I say it from a place of experience. So I should have known better when I made it to Thailand.\n\nThe Mistake\n\nI planned to spend six months traveling throughout Asia from July to December 2023 as I scouted a new possible long-term home base. On arrival in Thailand, I was issued a 30-day visa. I did not apply for this visa beforehand and planned not to stay more than 30 days.\n\nWhen I looked at the dates on my passport, the stamp said July 30 to August 30. I left Pattaya airport knowing I had to leave Thailand before August 30. My wife joined me halfway through my 30 days, so she had more time on her visa.\n\nOur time in Pattaya was amazing. We walked to the beach every day, as it was less than a 10-minute walk from our $400-a-month Airbnb. We soaked up the Southeast Asia heat and enjoyed the cheaper cost of living. We ate delicious food that was never more than $10 a meal. We spent hours walking the two impressive malls near our Airbnb.\n\nPattaya, Thailand, ended up not being a place we could call \u201chome,\u201d but we had the best time. After our time was up, we headed to the airport for the next leg of our journey: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nWe got to immigration at the Pattaya airport, and my wife got through quickly. On the other hand, I waited for what felt like an eternity as the customs agent stared at the screen and called over other immigration agents. They were chatting excitedly.\n\nAfter the commotion, the customs agent told me I had overstayed my visa and might be arrested. After traveling to 88 countries, I\u2019ve never overstayed a visa, and this moment was beyond scary.\n\nThe Lesson\n\nThe issue was that July 30 to August 30 was 31 days\u2014not 30. I was taken and held in a separate immigration area for hours with a lot of uncertainty about what would happen.\n\nI was thoroughly questioned about what I did in Thailand and why I overstayed my visa. The customs agents told me Thailand was sick of digital nomads overstaying their visas and not following the rules. I explained that I miscounted the days\u2014this was not something I had done intentionally. I was not paying attention, and I was sorry.\n\nI was eventually told I had to write a letter explaining why I overstayed and saying I\u2019d never do it again. I paid a fine for overstaying and was banned from returning to Thailand for six months. My passport was stamped with an overstay violation.\n\nI was allowed to leave after hours but was shaken as I went. The uncertainty and fear I experienced were vivid life lessons.\n\nThe Devil Is in the Details\n\nI\u2019m a full-time traveler, but being banned from Thailand made me realize I need to pay better attention to even the smallest details. The details matter and could be the difference between an amazing travel experience or being banned from a country.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a year since the incident, and I\u2019ve since traveled to Japan, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, Ireland, Amsterdam, Spain, France, and England. I\u2019ve not overstayed my visas in any of the countries.",

            "content": "Based on what happened the last time Donald Trump was president, the international education sector has a lot to fear. Travel bans on several Muslim-majority countries and a general unwelcoming stance toward international students did a lot to damage sentiment even before the pandemic quashed mobility outright.\n\nBut this second time around, there\u2019s a lot more at stake. With the U.S. hosting a record-high 1.126 million students from abroad\u2014largely due to growth in graduate students rather than new undergraduates\u2014Trump\u2019s expected crackdown might expose a dirty little secret: widespread misuse of student visas.\n\nWhile the vast majority of students who are granted a student visa successfully enter the U.S. and duly enroll in the academic institution which admitted them, there are exceptions to this general rule\u2014and a troubling many of them at that. According to a recent U.S. Customs and Border Patrol report, in fiscal year 2023, 51,556 individuals who entered the U.S. on an F, J or M student or exchange visitor visa overstayed the terms of their admission, a total overstay rate of about 3.5 percent.\n\nThe report breaks down overstays by country. In some cases, the overstay rate\u2014the percentage of those who were expected to depart the U.S. by a certain date but didn\u2019t\u2014was over 50 percent. And to put the 51,556 figure in a different perspective, consider that the Institute of International Education\u2019s most recent Open Doors report documented 298,705 new international student enrollments in 2023\u201324. So, for every six newly enrolled students, one more student visa holder violated the terms of their admission to the U.S.\n\nSome violations are relatively benign\u2014legitimate students who left the country a handful of days after their allowed postgraduation grace period come to mind. However, others are cases of willful fraud. Instead of showing up to the academic, language or vocational institution which admitted them, some of these \u201cstudents\u201d went underground to live and work in the U.S. illegally. These fake students clog the nonimmigrant visa system, which is already short-staffed, contributing to often lengthy delays for visa interviews for legitimate students eager to study in this country.\n\nAt least as importantly, the prevalence of fake students increases the likelihood that legitimate students don\u2019t get visas due to guilt by association.\n\nThis is a complex, systemic problem seldom discussed by university administrators who individually lack the means to solve or even address it. It is a sobering reality that well-intentioned admissions officials are inadvertently abetting overstays to this extent, along with Customs and Border Patrol agents and consular officials, the latter of whom are, ironically, sometimes criticized for excessive visa denials.\n\nHere is how the gaming of the system works.\n\nA university or school issues an admitted applicant an all-important Form I-20, which is the document required by U.S. consulates overseas to apply for an F-1 student visa. However, upon arrival in the U.S., the student visa holder fails to report to the institution that issued the I-20.\n\nSome students exercise their right to transfer to another U.S. university for legitimate reasons. For example, they may opt to go to a less expensive institution, or choose one that is closer to family and friends. However, some number never actually intended to enroll in college in the first place and just sought a student visa as a pretext to get to the U.S. And some alleged fake colleges have been designed to facilitate this route. The Department of Homeland Security even ran two such fake universities as sting operations to crack down on this route for immigration fraud.\n\nDespite this, U.S. colleges and universities continue to process untold numbers of applications and issue I-20s to individuals who have no intention of actually studying. Meanwhile, international education organizations in the U.S. advocate for policies that will allow more international students to study and work in this country. On balance that\u2019s to be applauded and supported. But this advocacy largely ignores the clear problem of fake students and overstays, and risks coming off as tone-deaf to those grappling with the consequences.\n\nThere are other gray areas in international higher education that are being exploited, even by legitimate students.\n\nMany U.S. higher education institutions offer students the opportunity to engage in curricular practical training. CPT allows students to gain real-world and often paid work experience as part of their academic program and is gaining in popularity\u2014there are currently 140,829 international students availing of this work benefit in the U.S. However, a loophole in the existing CPT regulations allows graduate students to engage in CPT from the very start of their studies; ordinarily students must complete one full academic year of study as a condition of CPT eligibility.\n\nWhile legitimate \u201cDay 1 CPT\u201d programs exist, the provision is being abused by universities and students for whom the academic aspect of their program is a distant second to the main goal\u2014 to work in the United States. A cottage industry has also emerged to help \u201cstudents\u201d avail themselves of Day 1 CPT.\n\nSome universities, such as Indiana-based Trine University, are being scrutinized for their Day 1 CPT practices. According to the Open Doors report, Trine\u2014which has satellite locations in Michigan, Virginia and Arizona\u2014enrolls the highest number of international students among master\u2019s-level universities in the U.S. Bloomberg reported in October that Trine requires as little as one in-person visit per semester for students on CPT.\n\nWhile egregious abuses may be the exception to the rule, too many Day 1 CPT opportunities are \u201cpay tuition to work\u201d schemes that undermine the spirit of the regulations, the proverbial tail wagging the dog. We can do better than this.\n\nInternational education professionals often reflexively avoid talking critically about practical training because few want this student visa benefit to be eliminated. That\u2019s understandable, because legitimate work opportunities in the U.S. are indeed a powerful magnet for international students and in many cases authentically complement their academic studies.\n\nHowever, without foundational soundness, the U.S. cannot continue to build on its reputation, especially one that is currently drawing significant numbers of international graduate students but failing to grow undergraduate enrollments commensurately.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d ethos may withdraw the welcome mat for many international students. But an arguably positive outcome would be cleaning up questionable international student mobility practices. Instead of lamenting another Trump term, it may be a good time to turn the mirror on ourselves and acknowledge what can be improved.",

Here are seven countries with digital nomad visas if you're looking to move abroad.\n\nTaiwan now offers a digital nomad visa for stays of up to six months.\n\nTo be eligible, applicants must meet age and income requirements, and have previously received a digital nomad visa from another country.\n\nTaiwan aims to attract digital professionals and boost tourism with this new visa program.\n\nTaiwan has just joined the list of countries offering digital nomad visas.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, the East Asian destination introduced its first digital nomad visa, allowing eligible foreign remote workers to live and work on the island for up to six months. Currently, U.S. citizens can visit Taiwan on a short-term tourist visa for up to 90 days, according to the U.S. State Department.\n\nLast summer, Taiwanese officials from the National Development Council announced the visa to attract and retain foreign digital professionals to boost Taiwan's tourism and economy, according to the local media outlet Taipei Times.\n\nTaiwan also plans to roll out programs to further incentivize digital nomads, such as investment and entrepreneurship opportunities, plus collaborate with South Korea and Japan \u2013 two nations that recently launched their own digital nomad visas \u2013 for easy travel between the destinations.\n\nTaiwan offers digital nomads the chance to explore its ancient temples, famous night markets and stunning national parks and beaches. It's also known as a generally safe destination, with progressive LGBTQ policies, and its capital, Taipei, ranked as the third-safest city in the world, according to Numbeo's Safety Index.\n\nHere's what to know about Taiwan's digital nomad visa.\n\n'Such a big feat': These Americans recently moved abroad. Here's what life has been like.\n\nWho is eligible for Taiwan's digital nomad visa?\n\nOnly citizens from visa-exempt countries, including the U.S., can apply for the digital nomad visa. There are certain conditions to qualify for the visa, one of which is that you've received a digital nomad visa from another country, according to the official visa guidelines.\n\nThere are also requirements based on your age and income.

            "content": "There are typically four key documents relating to nonimmigrant (i.e., temporary) travel to and authorized stay in the United States. It is important to understand what these documents are, what purpose they serve, and how they impact one another.\n\nUnderstanding these issues will help answer the questions \u201cCan I travel to the US?\u201d, \u201cHow long can I stay?\u201d, and \u201cIf I leave the US, can I come back?\u201d\n\nWhat Are the Nonimmigrant Travel and Status Documents?\n\n1. Passport\n\nA passport is an official travel document issued by a government that certifies a person\u2019s identity and nationality for international travel. In most cases, the passport assures entry only into the country that issued it. A visa is usually required for entry into other countries.\n\nAll nonimmigrants traveling to the US must hold a valid passport or similar travel document. The US requires that the passport be valid for at least six months beyond the period of intended stay in the United States. However, the US has agreements with certain countries that allow their citizens to enter the US even if their passports are set to expire within six months of the end of their intended stay. Citizens of these countries need only have a passport valid for their intended period of stay.\n\n2. Visa\n\nA US visa is an official document issued by a US consulate or embassy outside the United States. It is placed in the passport and allows the visa holder to travel to a US port of entry and request permission to enter the United States.\n\nA traveler seeking admission to the US in a nonimmigrant status must have a visa that is valid on the date of entry. However, the duration of stay (i.e., how long a nonimmigrant is authorized to stay in the US) is determined by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer upon entry.\n\nThere are many types of visas, each for a specific purpose. Examples include B-1/B-2 (business visitor/tourist), F-1 (student), H-1B (specialty occupation worker), and L-1 (intracompany transferee). There are many other categories of visas.\n\nAt present, 42 countries are eligible for visa-waived travel to the US for business and tourist travel purposes. Citizens of these countries may travel to the US for stays of up to 90 days without first obtaining a B-1 (business) or B-2 (tourist) visa. Although a visa is not required, these individuals must secure an approved travel authorization, referred to as Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) approval. Visa waiver/ESTA travelers must still be in possession of a valid passport and will be issued an I-94 record upon admission to the US.\n\n3. I-94 Record\n\nAn I-94 record, also known as an Arrival/Departure Record, is a document issued by a CBP officer at the port of entry. It records the traveler\u2019s entry into the US, specifying the date of entry, the class of admission (e.g., F-1 student, H-1B temporary worker, etc.), and the authorized period of stay.\n\nPrior to 2013, most I-94 records were issued on a white paper card stapled into the traveler\u2019s passport. Since 2013, most I-94 records have been processed electronically and are available via the website of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) here.\n\nThe I-94 is the document that determines nonimmigrant status in the US and its expiration, and it must be unexpired for the individual to remain in valid nonimmigrant status. Mintz recommends that clients check their I-94 record after every admission to the US to ensure that the class and period of admission are correct.\n\nNote that the I-94 may reflect a shortened period of authorized stay if the person\u2019s passport is expiring earlier than the period for which the individual would otherwise be admitted.\n\nWhen a petition or application to extend or change one\u2019s nonimmigrant status in the US is filed with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and approved, the approval notice will contain a new I-94 record reflecting the new or extended nonimmigrant status and period of authorized stay.\n\nWith limited exceptions, every entry into the United States results in a new I-94 record reflecting a new period of authorized admission. This is true even for those whose status was previously extended in the US, so it is critical to check the I-94 after every entry into the US.\n\n4. I-797 Approval Notice\n\nAs noted earlier, visas are issued by US consulates and embassies abroad. Some visa categories, such as H-1B, O-1, and (non-blanket) L-1, require approval of a petition by USCIS before the visa can be issued. The petition approval notice is issued by USCIS on Form I-797 Notice of Action, and a valid I-797 approval is a prerequisite to applying for a visa in these classifications.\n\nIn addition to a valid visa, nonimmigrants entering the US in categories requiring USCIS petition approval must have a valid I-797 approval notice when entering the US.\n\nExtensions and changes of nonimmigrant status are also approved on an I-797 Notice of Action. These will contain an updated I-94 governing the period of stay, which may be valid longer than the originally issued visa. As noted above, when later departing and reentering the US (which may require a new visa), a new I-94 will be issued governing the authorized period of stay.\n\nOther Common Situations\n\nSimilar to certain employment-based nonimmigrants requiring a USCIS-issued Form I-797 approval notice, other common situations include:\n\nStudents applying for F-1 visas must present a Form I-20 issued by the school they will attend in the US\n\nExchange Visitors applying for J-1 visas must present a Form DS-2019 issued by the J-1 program sponsor\n\nTravel to the US\n\nAny nonimmigrant traveling to the US must be in possession of:\n\nA passport valid for the intended duration of stay in the US (or, in some cases, valid for 6 months beyond the intended duration of stay);\n\nA valid nonimmigrant visa (unless traveling with ESTA approval or visa exempt); and\n\nIf applicable, the following classification-specific documents: H-1B, O-1, (non-blanket) L-1: an unexpired I-797 approval notice. Blanket L-1: Completed and signed Form I-129S with an unexpired endorsement from the US consulate or embassy. F-1: valid Form I-20 issued by the intended educational institution. J-1: valid Form DS-2019 issued by the exchange visitor program sponsor.\n\n\n\nAdditional guidance on entry into the US in a nonimmigrant visa status is available here.\n\n\n\nEntry and admission issues can be complex. This document is intended to provide general information only and does not constitute legal advice.

            "content": "06 Jan 2025\n\nGermany has launched an online platform for national visa applications, making its immigration process more modern.\n\nThe Consular Services Portal, introduced on January 1st, 2025, lets people from any country apply online for 28 types of national visas. These include visas for work, study, training, and family reunification.\n\nDigital platform replaces outdated processes\n\nGermany\u2019s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called the platform a \u201creal administrative revolution.\u201d\n\nThe platform follows a two-year pilot program in three visa sections and now connects all 167 German visa offices worldwide.\n\nApplicants can skip long forms and in-person visits by applying online.\n\nThis change addresses delays caused by paper-based procedures and mail. The digital portal speeds up the process, cuts wait times, and makes it easier for people to apply.\n\nAddressing skilled labor shortages\n\nGermany needs at least 400,000 skilled workers each year, impacting industries like healthcare and technology.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to deter people from coming here to roll up their sleeves due to outdated application forms and waiting periods,\u201d Baerbock stated.\n\nThe simplified visa process is part of a larger push to attract international workers and support the economy.\n\nThis effort ties into reforms under Germany\u2019s Skilled Immigration Act. Measures like the Opportunity Card make it easier for migrants with basic German skills and job experience to work in Germany.\n\nIn 2024, Germany also raised the number of work visas for Indian nationals from 20,000 to 90,000, showing its focus on meeting labor demands.\n\n(Image courtesy of Bu\u011fra \u015e\u0131kel via Unsplash)\n\nSimplified access for applicants worldwide\n\nThe Consular Services Portal makes it easier for people to live, work, or study in Germany. It is available at all German consulates and open to applicants worldwide. Plans to allow family and group applications will add further convenience.\n\nFor long-term visitors, the portal removes the need to travel to consulates, saving time and effort. By moving the process online, Germany speeds up visa approvals and makes the country more appealing to migrants and students.\n\nInfluence on EU immigration policies\n\nGermany\u2019s move to digitize visa procedures could shape immigration strategies across the EU.\n\nAs one of the bloc\u2019s largest economies, Germany sets an example for modern and efficient immigration policies. The initiative shows how digital tools can help address labor shortages while ensuring security and efficiency.\n\nBy highlighting the advantages of digital systems, Germany may encourage other EU countries to adopt similar approaches. This could lead to more aligned visa systems within the Schengen Area, strengthening the region\u2019s ability to attract global talent.\n\n(Image courtesy of Nicbou via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nA step toward a future-ready immigration system\n\nGermany\u2019s decision to digitize visa applications shows the need for immigration systems to adapt to global needs.\n\nBy using technology, Germany strengthens its appeal to skilled workers and students, which is vital for economic growth.\n\nThis change improves efficiency and sets a standard for modern immigration policies.\n\nAs Foreign Minister Baerbock stated, Germany now has \u201ca national visa process that is state-of-the-art\u2014modern, digital, and secure.\u201d Other countries may follow this example as they address their own immigration challenges.",

Over the last couple weeks, he\u2019s watched as he and others who share his visa status have been called \u201cinvaders\u201d and \u201ccheap labor.\u201d\n\nHe said it\u2019s hurtful and baffling, and he pointed out that visa holders like him are people who want to contribute and have much at stake.\n\nAs the issue continues to be the subject of debate, people like Pasumarti, 49, who hold an H-1B, a temporary visa for high-skilled workers, say they\u2019re unsure of what will happen to them.\n\n\u201cIt is confusing, actually, to be frank with you,\u201d Pasumarti said, pointing out the whiplash between other recent messaging that focuses on embracing immigrants with specialty skills.\n\nA fiery debate between different factions of MAGA loyalists ignited on social media in the days following Christmas after some of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s advisers came out in support of legal, high-skill immigration. It started after Trump named venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan to an artificial intelligence advisory role. An explosion of racism and xenophobia against Krishnan followed, with some on the far right criticizing him for past statements in support of green cards for skilled workers.\n\nAmid the feud, Trump said he supported H-1B visas. In the past, he\u2019s made comments about the program, saying, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have it. Very, very bad for workers.\u201d\n\nVivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, whom Trump has tapped to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, also weighed in, with Ramaswamy saying in a post, \u201cOur American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.\u201d\n\nMusk added in his own post that \u201cthe number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low.\u201d\n\nA number of prominent names spoke out about these comments, including far-right activists Laura Loomer and Steve Bannon. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley also said the tech industry was being \u201clazy\u201d and needed to \u201cinvest in our American workforce.\u201d\n\nA segment of social media called for the end of the H-1B visa program, making racist posts about Indians \u201cinvading\u201d the U.S. Indians make up around 75% of all H-1B petitioners, outpacing the next highest group, Chinese workers, who make up less than 12%.\n\nTrump\u2019s transition team did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.\n\n\u201cPeople on H-1B visas have always had a sense of concern over their status,\u201d said Pawan Dhingra, a professor of American studies at Amherst College. \u201cThe precarity of their jobs is kind of embedded in the visa itself. I think it\u2019s more intense now.\u201d\n\nOther politicians, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also weighed in, saying Musk is wrong and agreeing the H-1B program needs reform.\n\n\u201cThe main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.\u201d\n\nThe H-1B visa mandates applicants work in jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree, but a number of jobs employers make visa requests that only require an associate degree, such as working in operations.\n\nPasumarti said the overall characterization is insulting.\n\n\u201cThat is really painful,\u201d he said. \u201cThose words are really kind of concerning, actually.\u201d\n\nAccording to immigration experts, the federal government can\u2019t change visa caps; it can make the process slower and more difficult, which Trump attempted to do in his first term.\n\n\u201cThey do have the power to heavily audit firms and make life very difficult for companies that are hiring H-1B workers,\u201d said Gaurav Khanna, an associate professor of economics and an immigration scholar at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThe tech sector is heavily reliant on H-1B workers. If you cut off that supply, the tech sector is going to be unhappy.\u201d\n\nWitnessing the two warring factions of Trump\u2019s movement, workers like Pasumarti say there\u2019s much at stake. He said he is worried about his daughter, who has a disability and isn\u2019t able to go to college or travel. She will soon turn 21 and won\u2019t be eligible for a green card under Pasumarti\u2019s petition.\n\nHe pointed out that she can\u2019t get a student visa or a subsequent H-1B. \u201cI\u2019m going through a different pain to protect my child\u2019s status over here,\u201d he said. \u201cShe needs me. She can\u2019t even travel outside the States.\u201d\n\nThough it remains to be seen how much oxygen this issue gets, Dhingra said, many on the right might already feel more emboldened in their anti-Indian views.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be able to more freely voice these sentiments that make the Indian Americans the outsider, the enemy,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Just a few days before Christmas, when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced the appointment of the Indian-born venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan as senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, tensions within Trump\u2019s 2024 coalition led to a full-blown online war between certain Trump advisers, like the entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, and supporters who take a more hard-line stance against immigration. Krishnan, who moved to the United States almost two decades ago, is a general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and has previously led product and engineering teams at several tech giants, including X, Meta, Snap and Microsoft.\n\nThe clash started when the Trump ally and far-right provocateur Laura Loomer criticized Krishnan\u2019s appointment, calling it \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d on X and highlighting one of his tweets from November, in which he supported the removal of country-specific caps on green cards and \u201cunlocking skilled immigration.\u201d The present system does not allow any country to receive more than 7% of the estimated total of 140,000 employment-based green cards per year. Hence people from large countries such as India and China often face long backlogs compared to those from smaller nations.\n\nAs soon as Loomer\u2019s post gained traction and media attention, the focus shifted to the H-1B visa program, which allows highly skilled foreign workers in specialist occupations to be temporarily employed in the U.S. It turned into a racist row targeting Indians in the U.S., since they are the largest beneficiaries of this visa program. Over 70% of the H-1B visas approved have been allotted to people born in India each year since 2015. Those born in China are a distant second, hovering at the 12%-13% mark since 2018.\n\nThere is an annual regular cap of 65,000 new visas under this program each fiscal year, with an extra 20,000 visas available to those with a master\u2019s degree or higher from an American university. The recipients are picked through a lottery system.\n\nPursuing a postgraduate degree in the U.S. and hoping to get picked for the H-1B visa through a job in the tech or finance sectors has long been a pathway for Indians to migrate to the country, especially in the past decade. Indians also account for the second-highest number of international students in the U.S. In 2023, the U.S. government issued over 140,000 visas to students from India and, as of 2024, there were over 377,000 Indians studying in the U.S.\n\nIt is this dominance of Indians that seems to have caught the attention of the hard-line nativist wing of the MAGA world, whose adherents argue that the H-1B program, meant to attract top talent from around the world to the U.S., is misused by tech companies to staff their low-to-mid-level workforce for much lower pay than Americans would demand. However, Musk and Ramaswamy, Trump\u2019s choices for the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, have weighed in in favor of H-1B visas, saying that \u201cthere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent\u201d and, if the U.S. were to let go of this global talent, it would be employed by competitors.\n\nAs much as it was a \u201cdebate\u201d over H-1B visas, this online backlash has exposed the anxieties among Trump allies and MAGA supporters over Trump\u2019s appointment of several Indian Americans to his Cabinet. These include Ramaswamy, Kolkata-born Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who has been appointed as the director of the National Institutes of Health, and Harmeet Dhillon as the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the Department of Justice. Kash Patel is Trump\u2019s pick to be the FBI director, while Vice President-elect JD Vance\u2019s wife, Usha Vance, will be the first Indian-American second lady.\n\nIt is also, broadly, a reactionary lashing out against Indian immigrants in the U.S., who total a little over 5 million and are a highly influential community as well as the wealthiest minority group in the country. The majority of those who moved to the U.S. after 2010 are high-skilled workers who have well-paying jobs in fields like tech, finance, medicine and law. They are often cited as examples of immigrant achievement in the West and described as a \u201cmodel minority.\u201d\n\nWhile it is well known that Indian-origin CEOs dominate Silicon Valley leadership, including Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft chair and CEO Satya Nadella, about one-third of tech employees in Silicon Valley are also of Indian origin and a number of other top-tier leadership positions in these companies are also held by Indians or those of Indian origin. According to a recent report by the nonprofit Indiaspora, in partnership with Boston Consulting Group, of the 648 unicorn startups (privately owned startups worth over $1 billion) in the U.S., 72 are led by Indian-origin founders.\n\nAround 78% of Indian Americans hold bachelor\u2019s degrees or higher, more than double the national average of 36%. Their median household income of $166,200 is nearly double that of all immigrant-led households ($78,700) and native-led households ($77,600), according to a Migration Policy Institute report. \u201cIn 2023, Indian immigrants were roughly half as likely to be in poverty (6%) as immigrants overall (14%) or the U.S. born (12%),\u201d the report said.\n\nBut apart from drawing attention to Indian immigrants in the U.S., this controversy has also sparked a conversation on \u201cmerit-based\u201d or \u201cskills-based\u201d immigration, which has become something of a policy darling within some Republican circles. The GOP\u2019s 2024 party platform prioritized \u201cmerit-based immigration\u201d over what it described as \u201cchain migration,\u201d the process by which relatives sponsor immigrants for entry into the U.S., describing the former as \u201censuring those admitted to our Country contribute positively to our Society and Economy, and never become a drain on Public Resources.\u201d\n\nA similar defense has been made of H-1B visas, portraying them as beneficial to the U.S. economy and national security, ensuring that the brightest minds come to the country. In a long post on X, Ramaswamy wrote about \u201cculture,\u201d bemoaning the lack of overachievers among 1990s sitcom protagonists. Notably, he said, \u201c\u2018Normalcy\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent. And if we pretend like it does, we\u2019ll have our asses handed to us by China.\u201d\n\nIn this skills-based view, immigration is an extension of the U.S. economy and a tool for its titans of industry. Under such an immigration system, the government decides what \u201ctype\u201d of immigrant is most beneficial to the U.S. and prioritizes immigration access accordingly. A skills-based immigration system provides a tool for recruiting more engineers, computer programmers, welders or whatever occupation is deemed to be in the \u201cnational interest\u201d depending on the prevailing influence in Washington.\n\nWhile revolutionary within right-wing circles for its seemingly colorblind and technocratic approach, merit-based immigration remains at odds with Trump\u2019s racist immigration rhetoric.\n\nThe distinction between legal and illegal immigration was repeated on the campaign trail in order to incite against immigrants. Yet Trump\u2019s accusation that Haitian immigrants were eating their neighbors\u2019 pets in Ohio, as well as his \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d highlight that, for him, country of origin remains an important factor in determining someone\u2019s eligibility to immigrate to the U.S. How this reconciles with a skills-based view of immigration remains unclear.\n\nMerit-based immigration offers its own world of obstacles and issues around discrimination, and still fails to recognize a genuine disconnect between how immigration is discussed as politics and the reality of the U.S. immigration system.\n\nLittle attention is paid to the workers whose immigration status is tied to their job security. Ramaswamy was quick to extol the virtues of those who value \u201cmore math tutoring, fewer sleepovers,\u201d while relying heavily on stereotypes about model minorities without actually discussing any of the challenges immigrant workers face in the U.S.\n\nRamaswamy has seemingly benefited from people assuming he is himself some kind of genius savant, a trend that is not uncommon in the tech and venture capital industries. The myth of digital wizards poses a unique risk for democratic processes, fueling reliance on technocratic experts who, by and large, seem to be motivated primarily by the pursuit of their own self-interest.\n\nMore broadly, merit-based immigration reduces everyone to their profession, a number in a spreadsheet, a smaller part of a much larger economic machine. While presented as technocratic, such an approach ignores what is, by and large, an arbitrary choice about which industry is prioritized. Far from being objective, such a view largely favors wealthier, more educated immigrants who already have an easier time coming to the U.S. It\u2019s bad for workers, regardless of their citizenship status or ethnic background.\n\nTrump weighed in and seemed to contradict comments he made in the past on H-1B, having restricted access to visas for foreign workers during his first term. \u201cI\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B,\u201d Trump told the New York Post over the phone. \u201cI have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program.\u201d On New Year\u2019s Eve, he further added, \u201cI didn\u2019t change my mind. I\u2019ve always felt we had to have the most competent people in our country.\u201d\n\nBut it was the nativist community cultivated by Musk on X that spearheaded the initial criticisms of him and the H-1B program. Many of the earliest posts came from accounts affiliated with white nationalists and MAGA trolls, which were later suspended or had their checkmarks removed shortly after criticizing Musk.\n\nThis was significant because, for the first time, X had seemingly reprimanded accounts engaged in hate speech, albeit only after they posted about Musk. Prior to their suspension or removal of verified account status, these users were paying for X\u2019s suite of features, which replaced the old verification system, and had leveraged them for increased exposure.\n\nIn fact, Musk himself has repeatedly engaged with explicitly antisemitic posts and accounts on X. For instance, in November 2023, he replied to a post accusing Jewish people of spreading \u201canti-white hate\u201d with praise, stating, \u201cYou have said the actual truth.\u201d He also supported Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party after a man drove a car through a Christmas market in Magdeburg. He declared immigration was to blame and penned an op-ed in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, after which the paper\u2019s opinion editor resigned.\n\nThis controversy illustrates the influence that Trump\u2019s 2024 allies, especially Musk, wield on the president-elect\u2019s policy agenda, perhaps to the chagrin of his 2016 supporters. While Steve Bannon, a former Trump campaign manager, was quick to criticize the visa system as a \u201cscam,\u201d those involved in Musk\u2019s orbit have insisted that such policies serve the national interest. It appears that Trump has begun to agree with them, at least for now.\n\nSign up to our mailing list to receive our stories in your inbox.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 A group of Afghan nationals arrived in the Philippines \u2060on Monday to process special immigrant visas for their resettlement in the United States, as part of an agreement between Manila and Washington.\n\nThe Philippines agreed last July to temporarily host a U.S. immigrant visa processing center for a limited number of Afghan nationals aspiring to resettle in America.\n\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza said the Afghan nationals who landed in the Philippines on Monday were provided entry visas. She said they had completed extensive security vetting and undergone full medical screenings prior to their arrival.\n\nThe U.S. government will cover the costs for the Afghan nationals\u2019 stay in the Philippines, including their food, housing, security, medical and transportation expenses, she said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t specify how many Afghans arrived or how long the visa processing will take. Under the Philippines\u2019 rules, visa applicants can stay for no longer than 59 days.\n\nA senior Philippine official told The Associated Press last year that only 150 to 300 applicants would be accommodated in the Philippines under the \u201cone-time\u201d deal. The official who had knowledge of the negotiations agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to speak publicly.\n\nThe Afghan nationals seeking resettlement primarily worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan or were deemed eligible for U.S. special immigrant visas but were left behind when Washington withdrew from the country and Taliban militants took back power in a chaotic period in 2021.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken first relayed the request to his Philippines counterpart in 2022, and President Joe Biden discussed the request with Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr. when he visited the U.S. last year, Philippine officials said.\n\nMarcos has rekindled relations with the U.S. since winning the presidency by a landslide margin two years ago. In February last year, he allowed an expansion of the American military presence under a 2014 defense agreement in a decision that upset China.\n\n___\n\nNg contributed from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",

            "content": "If there is one issue that illuminates the tensions between the populist and the plutocratic wings of Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement, it\u2019s the issuance of H-1B visas to high-skilled workers born overseas. Trump started his political career opposed to the program, which allows up to eighty-five thousand foreign workers with \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d to receive visas each year. Then, in March, 2016, during a primary debate he said, \u201cI\u2019m softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.\u201d At another debate a week later, he reversed course: \u201cI know the H-1B very well. And it\u2019s something that I, frankly, use, and I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use. We shouldn\u2019t have it. Very, very bad for workers.\u201d\n\nAs President, in June, 2020, Trump issued an executive order temporarily banning H-1B visas, which a federal court struck down. That October, his Administration enacted new rules to try to restrict the program. After Trump\u2019s re\u00eblection, this past November, many expected another assault on H-1Bs, but they hadn\u2019t reckoned with the intervention of the tech barons (and Trump appointees) Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who both defended the visa program, setting off a bitter dispute on social media and on conservative airwaves during the holiday season. Steve Bannon has called the H-1B program a corporate \u201cscam\u201d and last week, warned Musk\u2014who had pledged to \u201cgo to war\u201d to protect the visas\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re going to rip your face off.\u201d\n\nTrump supporters such as Bannon and the conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer aren\u2019t the only ones criticizing the H-1B program. In a statement posted on Musk\u2019s X platform last week, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said it served \u201cnot to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad.\u201d Ro Khanna, a progressive Democratic congressman who represents Silicon Valley, said the visa program was being \u201cabused\u201d and needed reforming. Evidently, this is an area where figures from the right and the left find common ground.\n\nAnd yet, for decades there has been a bipartisan consensus that the U.S. is falling behind other countries in technical education, and that bringing in highly skilled foreigners can help to close the gap. A number of economic studies have argued that the visa program helps foster innovation and growth. A paper published in 2019 found that firms that employed workers via H-1B visas were more likely to be associated with new patents and patent citations. A study published last year concluded that H-1B \u201clottery wins enable firms to scale up without generating large amounts of substitution away from native workers.\u201d\n\nBut not everybody is convinced. Shortly before Sanders entered the fray, I spoke with Ronil Hira, a political scientist at Howard University who has been studying the H-1B program for more than two decades and writing about it at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, and elsewhere. Hira has frequently testified before Congress about what he sees as the program\u2019s tendency to depress wages, promote outsourcing, and pad the profits of tech companies. The political fractures exposed by the MAGA blowup weren\u2019t surprising to him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a left-right issue,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a worker-corporations issue.\u201d\n\nH-1Bs are employer-sponsored visas that Congress introduced in 1990 as part of the bipartisan Immigration Act that President George H. W. Bush signed into law. \u201cThis legislation will encourage the immigration of exceptionally talented people, such as scientists, engineers, and educators,\u201d he said at the signing ceremony. Typically, the H-1Bs last for three years and can be extended for another three. Before 2007, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (U.S.C.I.S.) allocated them on a first-come, first-served basis. Now if the cap is reached, it switches to a lottery system. Since 2013, this cap has been reached every year and the number of applicants has usually been four to five times greater than the number of available visas. Legally, the visas are reserved for occupations requiring \u201chighly specialized knowledge.\u201d In its eligibility guidelines, however, the U.S.C.I.S. says this requirement can be satisfied with attainment of a bachelor\u2019s degree or its equivalent. Many successful applicants have higher degrees\u2014master\u2019s or Ph.D.\u2014but others don\u2019t. (A little over a quarter of the visas are allotted to those with higher degrees.)\n\nAlthough any business operating in the United States can sponsor or hire someone who holds an H-1B visa, the successful applicants are predominantly sponsored by large tech companies. In 2024, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and I.B.M. were in the top ten, according to the Wall Street Journal. So were three Indian technology-consulting firms that operate in the United States\u2014Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, and HCL America\u2014and one U.S.-owned equivalent, Cognizant. These consulting firms all facilitate outsourcing routine office work to low-cost contract workers here and overseas. In one notorious case reported in the New York Times in 2015, some tech workers at Disney in Florida were forced to train their replacements, who were supplied by HCL America.\n\nDuring the intra-MAGA spat on X, Musk said he was referring to \u201cbringing in via legal immigration the top ~0.1% of engineering talent as being essential for America to keep winning.\u201d But a wide range of jobs, from senior engineering and managerial positions to junior-analyst jobs are eligible for H-1B visas. According to data from the Department of Labor, Tesla had more than fifteen hundred H-1B positions in 2024, with salaries ranging from under eighty thousand dollars to nearly three hundred thousand. (The median was a hundred and forty-five thousand.) \u201cThere\u2019s always a shortage of the super-skilled workers\u2014the top 0.1 per cent of them, which Musk talks about,\u201d Hira said. \u201cBut most of the people getting H-1B visas are not these geniuses.\u201d\n\nHira has personal experience with the immigration system, and the economic benefits it can generate for people from poor countries who obtain professional jobs in the United States. His mother and father\u2014a doctor and an engineer\u2014both emigrated from India in the nineteen-fifties, and moved to the United States, obtaining green cards before becoming naturalized citizens. \u201cMy cousins in India\u2014it\u2019s clearly far better for them to earn sixty thousand dollars in the United States than ten thousand dollars in India,\u201d Hira said. He also agrees with the consensus among economists that, over all, skilled immigration has generated substantial benefits for the United States. But he thinks that the H-1B program is designed to favor employers and disfavor workers, including H-1B visa holders. \u201cIf you look at how the system operates, you can see that these workers have no leverage and the corporations do,\u201d Hira said. \u201cAre you telling me that for-profit companies won\u2019t take advantage of this situation?\u201d\n\nSupporters of the program dispute the claim that it replaces U.S. workers and keeps wages low. In a fact sheet published on Friday, the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration advocacy group, noted that companies applying for visas have to certify to the Department of Labor that hiring a foreign worker won\u2019t adversely affect the wages or conditions of U.S. workers that they employ in similar positions. The fact sheet also pointed out that, in 2021, \u201cthe median wage of an H-1B worker was $108,000, compared to $45,760 for U.S. workers in general. Moreover, between 2003 and 2021, the median wage of H-1B workers grew by 52 percent.\u201d\n\nOf course, wages in the tech sector tend to be higher over-all than in many other parts of the economy: it\u2019s a high-productivity industry that employs many highly educated people. The Department of Labor sets minimum required wages for H-1B positions based on occupation, skill-level and geographic location. Hira says these wages are too low and enable employers to compensate workers at below-market rates. A 2020 paper that he co-wrote with Daniel Costa, the director of immigration-law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, cited data showing that, in the previous year, sixty per cent of H-1B positions certified to the Labor Department had wage levels below the local median wage for the occupation. \u201cThe fundamental flaw of the H-1B program is that it permits U.S. employers to legally underpay H-1B workers relative to U.S. workers in similar occupations in the same region,\u201d the paper said.",

            "content": "An ongoing clash between Republicans over visas for highly skilled immigrants is bringing new attention to the program, which Maine business and immigration experts say is vital to filling jobs in some of the state\u2019s fastest-growing industries amid a tight labor market.\n\nThe visas, known as H-1B visas, allow 65,000 skilled workers to come to the U.S. each year to fill specialized jobs that require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, often in technology, health care, higher education, scientific research or other STEM fields.\n\nNationally, tech giants like Tesla, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Apple use H-1B visas to source thousands of higher-level employees. Locally, they\u2019re favored by companies like The Jackson Laboratory, Eastern Maine Medical Center, the University of Maine, Idexx and Wex.\n\nThe program made headlines last week after Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who\u2019ve been tapped to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, defended the visas and the need to bring \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d into the United States. Musk, who grew up in South Africa and is now the richest man in the world, wrote on X, the social media platform that he owns, that H-1B visas are the reason he and many other immigrants have found success living and working in the U.S. He said he was prepared to \u201cgo to war on this issue.\u201d\n\nBut anti-immigration Republicans have criticized the program as a way to take well-paying jobs away from Americans and hand them to foreign workers for less money. The H-1B visas have also been criticized by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who argued that companies abuse the program. He likened the visa recipients to \u201clow-wage indentured servants from abroad.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has historically opposed the H-1B visa program, believing companies should prioritize American labor over hiring foreign workers. In 2020, he restricted several forms of legal immigration, including access to H-1B and H-2B visas, which are used for jobs in fields like hospitality and construction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut last week Trump appeared to change course and defended the program, siding with Musk, saying the country \u201cneeds smart people.\u201d\n\n\u2018HARDER TO MEET STAFFING\u2019\n\nThe apparent shift is welcome news to many companies \u2014 including dozens in Maine \u2014 that rely on the program.\n\nEastern Maine Medical Center and The Jackson Laboratory are consistently the top two Maine entities to request H-1B workers. In 2024, the laboratory requested 37 visas and the hospital requested 34. In 2023, they requested 51 and 45 visas, respectively.\n\nEastern Maine Medical Center has roughly 120 H-1B employees at a given time, said Paul Bolin, executive vice president and chief people and administrative officer for Northern Light Health, the hospital\u2019s parent company.\n\n\u201cThings have gotten worse since the pandemic,\u201d Bolin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state isn\u2019t producing enough nurses to meet the need, so the hospital is still reliant on traveling and international nurses and medical staff.\n\n\u201cIf those are further restricted, it would make it that much harder to meet our staffing needs,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Joughin, senior associate director of the Office of International Programs at the University of Maine, said the program is vital to both the university and the broader University of Maine System. In 2024, the university system was approved for 30 H-1B visas, 24 of which were for positions at the flagship campus in Orono.\n\nAccording to Joughin, the program \u201cenables our institutions to attract and retain highly skilled professionals from around the world, ensuring access to a global talent pool essential for advancing research, innovation, and academic excellence. This is particularly critical in specialized fields where domestic expertise may be limited, such as engineering, computer science, and advanced research disciplines,\u201d she said, adding that the national shortage of qualified STEM professionals has made it difficult to recruit U.S. citizens for more specialized roles.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Jackson Lab also reinforced the importance of the program.\n\n\u201cJAX \u2014 and the U.S. scientific community at large \u2014 depends on the H-1B visa program to foster international collaboration and drive groundbreaking research. The diverse expertise and innovative perspectives the international community contributes are crucial to advancing our mission to improve human health,\u201d it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSMALL BUT MIGHTY\n\nOn top of the 65,000 yearly cap, an additional 20,000 visas are available to workers who have received an advanced degree in the U.S.\n\nUniversities, nonprofits affiliated with universities and nonprofit or government research organizations are exempt from the cap. The visas are good for three years and can be extended to six.\n\nThe specialized work visas are different from H-2B visas \u2014 the temporary work authorizations that many of Maine\u2019s seasonal and tourism-based businesses rely on each year.\n\nH-2B visas are issued when there are not enough U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to do temporary work, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Business owners have to prove that they tried to hire in the U.S. and that hiring foreign workers will not adversely impact the wages or working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\n\nH-1B visas, however, do not require proof that the business owner tried to recruit within the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the H-1B visas, there is a 66,000 cap, but the Department of Homeland Security frequently releases more. In November, the federal government announced an additional 65,000 H-2B visas.\n\nIt was welcome news to Maine\u2019s seasonal businesses, which last year were approved for just shy of 2,000 H-2B workers.\n\nComparatively, Maine employers last year were approved for 320 H-1B workers \u2014 148 new positions and 172 extensions.\n\nPatrick Woodcock, president and CEO of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, warned against discounting the program as less important for its size.\n\n\u201cIt is some of the fastest growing companies in the state that are utilizing it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe program has been modest in numbers, but I think in terms of economic output for the state, they really have been pretty consequential.\u201d\n\nH-2B visas are critically important, especially in the increasingly tight labor market of the last few years, but the need for H-1B visas will likely only increase as the state tries to combat an aging population and declining workforce participation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe number of H-1B new or extended workers in Maine has been increasing over the last decade, with a low of 217 in 2015 and a high of 342 in 2022. It was not immediately clear how many total workers are in the state at a given time because people in the second or third year of a visa are not counted in yearly totals.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly important program to supplement our existing workforce \u2026 and it is critical to maintain some of the progress we\u2019ve seen economically in recent years,\u201d Woodcock said.\n\nAN EMPLOYMENT \u2018WORKHORSE\u2019\n\nMany people now on or seeking an H-1B visa came to the U.S. through a different visa program for school, and one to three years after graduation need an employer to sponsor a special skills visa to stay, said Stefanie Trice Gill, founder and chief recruiter of IntWork, a Maine recruiting firm that specializes in pairing immigrants with employers.\n\n\u201cOften they\u2019re with people who\u2019ve been working with them for some time, and the employers just can\u2019t afford to let them go,\u201d Trice Gill said. \u201cIt\u2019s much better for employers to be able to bring someone to their tech company in Maine than to have to leave Maine to find workers.\u201d\n\nTrice Gill said she does not work with many H-1B visa holders, though the agency is interested in doing so \u2014 the immigrants who go through IntWork are often already living in Maine and already have work permits. They don\u2019t need sponsorship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut even with that supply, employers still struggle to fill key positions,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Trice Gill, immigrants are more likely to have a master\u2019s degree in a STEM field than a U.S.-born candidate, she said.\n\n\u201cFor those professions that require an advanced degree, we can\u2019t meet the need without considering immigrant candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the U.S. industry grows, the workforce has been declining. Even with all the effort to get U.S. citizens to study STEM professions, there\u2019s still a big shortage of skilled STEM professionals.\u201d\n\nMarcus Jaynes, an immigration attorney with Landis, Arn and Jaynes in Westbrook, called H-1B visas the \u201cworkhorse of temporary employment\u201d for professional positions.\n\nThe 65,000 to 85,000 cap is barely touching the demand.\n\n\u201cLast year there were half a million registrations in the annual lottery,\u201d said Jaynes, who specializes in business and employment-related immigration law. \u201cThat\u2019s a really high contrast. It shows very clearly that employers are looking to bring on a lot more H-1B workers than they can.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cap is already too low, so further limiting the number would be challenging, Jaynes said.\n\n\u201cIf the program sees restrictions, it\u2019s going to hurt the individual companies that can\u2019t access the program, but it\u2019s also going to hurt the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nJaynes is encouraged by Trump\u2019s recent statements favoring the program but said there\u2019s still \u201ca lot of room for damage to be done\u201d by restricting the program through other means than the cap, like raising the minimum prevailing wages to make them less accessible to smaller companies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of speculation about what may happen,\u201d he said.",

But in the \u201cAll-In-Podcast\u201d last summer, he proposed to offer green cards to international students who graduate from American schools.\n\nDale Gardner, a political science professor at Parkland College, explained Trump\u2019s shift in stance. \u201cSo I would suspect he\u2019s looking at international students as a source of economic benefit for the U.S.\u201d\n\nInternational students struggle to find jobs and internships in the United States due to the barrier of visa sponsorship.\n\nFNU Mohi, an international graduate student at the University of Illinois said companies have to offer sponsorships for international students to be eligible to work in the United States. However, the amount of companies offering sponsorships is really low.\n\nIn addition, Mohi said that even the student visa process seems to be limited.\n\n\u201cI have multiple friends who applied for F-1 Visa and got rejected by their visa officers without getting any kind of valid explanation as to why they were rejected.\u201d\n\nSo, Trump\u2019s recent green card proposal has given some international students hope. However, with over 1.1 million of these students in the United States, questions remain whether the green card policy can be implemented.\n\n\u201cWell they\u2019ve been really poor in making any immigration reforms, so I wouldn\u2019t have high hopes,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nAt the University of Illinois, there are more than 11,000 foreign students. Most are from China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan. Parkland College has more than 300 international students.\n\nIf the policy is implemented, Gardner said it would be better than mass deportations. Mohi doesn\u2019t have high hopes either, but he does wish for the policy to be implemented.\n\n\n\n",

(NYSE: V) between November 16, 2023 and September 23, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), of the important January 21, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.\n\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Visa securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Visa class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=29131 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Visa was not in compliance with federal antitrust laws; (2) Visa did not have effective internal programs and policies to assess and control compliance with federal antitrust laws; and (3) as a result, defendants\u2019 public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Visa class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=29131 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "Amid the ongoing debate over H-1B visas in the United States, the prospective applicants and their employers are bracing for the intricate costs tied to the coveted work permit, starting from fiscal year 2025. The H-1B program allows US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries, but it comes with hefty fees that vary depending on the type of petition being filed and the status of the employer.\n\nMoreover, a new rule also came into effect in 2025 which will allow entrepreneurs to sponsor themselves for the H1B visa. This means that entrepreneurs establishing a tech company in the US can self-sponsor, provided they meet the eligibility criteria for the visa, such as having specialised knowledge.\n\nTill now, individuals were not considered eligible for H-1B visas unless they could demonstrate employment with a sponsoring organisation. It made getting an employment permit difficult for entrepreneurs who wanted to launch their ventures independently.\n\nH-1B Visa Application Fee\n\nRegistration Fee: To be part of the H-1B lottery, applicants are required to pay a registration fee of $10, a figure that has remained unchanged since 2024. This marks the first step for prospective applicants during the initial registration period, which typically occurs in March each year.\n\nFiling Fees: Further, the employers have to pay $460 as a base filing fee for all H-1B petitions. To top it, an anti-fraud fee of $500 is mandatory for all initial and change of employer petitions, to prevent fraud and misuse of the H-1B program.\n\nEmployer Surcharge: Companies with more than 50 employees, half of whom hold H-1B or L-1 visas, are required to pay a $4,000 fee under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. This surcharge remains in effect until September 30 2025.\n\nPremium Processing (Optional): Employers who are in a rush to hire an overseas employee can opt to expedite the processing of their H-1B petitions to just 15 calendar days by paying a premium processing fee of $2,805. This service is a necessity for critical hires in time-sensitive industries.\n\nWho Pays What?\n\nIn the H-1B visa application process, the majority of the financial burden typically falls on the shoulders of the employer. An additional $4,000 employer fee also lies squarely with them. However, there are specific rules through which visa stamping and interview-related fees may be passed on to the employees.\n\nTotal Estimated Costs\n\nHere's an estimated cost breakdown of the total cost of applying for an H-1B visa:\n\nFor companies not subjected to the additional $4,000 fee -- $10 (Registration Fee) + $460 (Base Filing Fee) + $500 (Anti-Fraud Fee) = $970\n\nFor companies subjected to the additional $4,000 fee-- $10 (Registration Fee) + $460 (Base Filing Fee) + $500 (Anti-Fraud Fee) + $4,000 (Additional Employer Fee) = $4,970\n\nFor Premium Processing-- A $2,805 is added for expedited processing, bringing the total for employers opting for premium processing to $3,775 or $7,775, depending on employer status.\n\nDebate Over H-1b Visa In US\n\nThree weeks ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, the debate on the H-1B visa program has intensified, literally creating divisions in both the Democratic and the Republican parties.\n\nIndians are the main beneficiaries of the H-1B visas, which bring in the best of the talent and brains from across the world. Highly skilled professionals from India walk away with the overwhelming number of H-1B visas - which is Congressional mandated 65,0000 every year and another 20,000 for those who received higher education from the US.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has come out in support of the H-1B, and so have two of his close confidants, Tesla owner Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom have been tasked to head the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nHowever, they are facing a backlash from the supporters of Mr Trump who argued that this is eating away at the jobs of Americans. Moreover, on Thursday, influential Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders also asserted that the two close confidants of Trump are wrong.\n\n\"Elon Musk and a number of other billionaire tech company owners have argued that this federal programme is vital to our economy because of the scarcity of highly skilled American engineers and other tech workers. I disagree.\n\n\"The main function of the H-1B visa programme and other guest worker initiatives is not to hire 'the best and the brightest', but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad. The cheaper the labour they hire, the more money the billionaires make,\" Sanders said on Thursday.",

            "content": "Many Americans have never experienced a \u201cgood economy,\u201d if a good economy is defined as one in which an individual can graduate from high school or college and find a job that pays four times the cost of housing.\n\nAt one time that was considered a rule of thumb for personal finance \u2014 25% of an individual\u2019s monthly income was what could prudently be spent on monthly rent or a mortgage payment.\n\nToday that would make anyone laugh, or cry. And what\u2019s worse, a rising number of working-age Americans have dropped out of the labor force entirely. According to the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s \u201cEmployment Situation Summary\u201d released on Dec. 6, the labor participation rate in November was 62.5%, down from 66% in November 2004. The labor participation rate is the percentage of the civilian, non-institutional population, age 16 and older, currently working or looking for work.\n\nThe same report says there were 4.5 million people in this country working part-time who would have liked to work full-time, but their hours had been cut or they couldn\u2019t find full-time jobs.\n\nThere were 1.7 million people who had been out of work for 27 weeks or more, up from 1.2 million a year earlier.\n\nThe Labor Department said the number of people \u201cnot in the labor force who currently want a job\u201d is 5.5 million. They\u2019re not counted as \u201cunemployed\u201d because they were not \u201cactively looking for work during the four weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job.\u201d\n\nAnother 1.6 million people were categorized as \u201cmarginally attached to the labor force\u201d (looking for work in the last 12 months but not in the last 4 weeks) or \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d who had completely given up because they \u201cbelieved no jobs were available for them.\u201d\n\nThis is the context for the controversy over \u201cDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d (DEI) hiring requirements and U.S. employers\u2019 use of H-1B visas to replace American workers with less costly foreign workers. Millions of Americans are unable to find jobs that support themselves and their families, or potential families. Regardless of education, training or experience, many job-seekers are experiencing life in America as a door slammed in their faces.\n\n\u201cLearn to code\u201d was the bitter advice offered to those who lost manufacturing or natural resource extraction jobs when U.S. policies pushed that work to other countries. \u201cTrain your H-1B replacement or no severance check\u201d was the cold directive to American tech workers years later.\n\nThe crushing of job opportunities for the American worker has been going on for so long that many people in the workforce have never known a level playing field. Adding insult to injury, the regulatory burdens on small businesses have made entrepreneurship needlessly difficult. In California, it\u2019s a virtual suicide mission. Even working as an independent contractor has effectively been outlawed by the notorious Assembly Bill 5, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2019. President Joe Biden supported a national version of AB 5, the PRO Act, which would have extended the damage to the rest of the country.\n\nScarcity of economic opportunity over decades led various groups to exert pressure for DEI mandates in college admissions, hiring and contracting. The ideology peaked with President Joe Biden openly stating that he would only consider Black women for his VP pick and his first Supreme Court nomination. That sent a message that certain types of race and sex discrimination were strongly encouraged by those at the highest levels of power.\n\nBut is DEI legal? Does the Constitution allow the use of race or sex to exclude some applicants from hiring, promotion, admissions and contracting?\n\nThe historical answer is \u201cmaybe,\u201d because the truth is that the Constitution was never amended to ban discrimination on the basis of race or sex. The nineteenth-century Congress refused to add this language, proposed by Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, to the 14th Amendment: \u201cAll laws, state or national, shall operate impartially and equally on all persons without regard to color or race.\u201d The same Congress removed this clause from the Civil Rights Act of 1866: \u201cthere shall be no discrimination in civil rights or immunities among the inhabitants of any State or Territory of the United States on account of race, color, or previous condition of slavery.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Opinion Columnists | Susan Shelley: Medi-Cal under strain after state extends aid to illegal immigrants\n\nSusan Shelley: Medi-Cal under strain after state extends aid to illegal immigrants Opinion Columnists | One day, our morals will be sensitive to animals\n\nOne day, our morals will be sensitive to animals Opinion Columnists | The United Nations is an enabler of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oppression of women\n\nThe United Nations is an enabler of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oppression of women Opinion Columnists | Gavin Newsom moves to the center as he auditions for the White House\n\nGavin Newsom moves to the center as he auditions for the White House Opinion Columnists | California\u2019s cities and schools face big budget gaps, few options In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed decades of precedents with its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring racial segregation in schools to be unconstitutional regardless of the history of the 14th Amendment or previous decisions interpreting it. \u201cWe must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education,\u201d Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the unanimous opinion.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to know if discrimination on the basis of race is illegal, allowable or mandatory. If the \u201ceffect\u201d of discrimination is the standard, then the Constitution might require or allow diversity directives. Or maybe not. It\u2019s subjective, and it\u2019s continuously vulnerable to changing judicial interpretations, all because a nineteenth-century Congress didn\u2019t ban discrimination on the basis of race. Or sex, obviously. Women in 1866 were not even voters.\n\nIn 2024, amid public backlash and a changing legal landscape, many companies and universities ended their DEI programs, and that number is growing. The editor-in-chief of Campus Reform said administrators increasingly realize that DEI\u2019s \u201coutcomes are detrimental to education.\u201d\n\nThe outcomes from the H-1B visa program have been detrimental to the American workers who have found themselves displaced by imported foreign labor.\n\nAll Americans deserve a genuinely free market for labor, without government distortion in any direction.\n\nWrite Susan@SusanShelley.com and follow her on X @Susan_Shelley",

More than 9,600 employers in California sought clearance for at least one H-1B worker in fiscal 2024, with 78,860 visa applications for new and continuing employment being approved, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nThey include all kinds of skilled work in various industries, including nurses and science teachers. But the top 10 beneficiaries of H-1B visas in California\u2014accounting for almost one-third of all the approvals\u2014were dominated by tech giants, most of them in the Bay Area.\n\n\"Those companies are the ones that can afford to hire outside firms that navigate the paperwork, the bureaucracy, and can jump through the hoops,\" said Todd O'Boyle, who leads technology policy at the Chamber of Progress, a group backed by big tech firms.\n\nThe number of H-1B visas for new employment is capped at 65,000 a year nationally. An additional 20,000 are set aside for foreign nationals who have earned a master's degree or higher in the U.S. H-1B visas are good for three years but can be extended for up to another three years.\n\nTech companies in California and elsewhere have relied on the program even as they made massive job cuts following the pandemic, during which many went overboard on hiring and other spending.\n\nThe fact that tech companies have fired thousands of American workers while hiring large numbers of foreign workers has added to the fury of anti-immigration Trump supporters, who have long argued immigrants take jobs away from Americans by working for less pay.\n\nThe question of whether that claim is valid does not have an easy or simple answer.\n\nU.S. graduate school students in engineering and the sciences are disproportionately foreign-born, and even with that there are shortages of some highly skilled workers, particularly in high-tech engineering and emerging areas such as artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia, the major Santa Clara supplier of AI hardware and software, got H-1B visa approvals for more than 1,500 workers last year in California, according to USCIS data. The company declined to comment, and other top tech users of the H-1B, including Google, Meta and Apple, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"If you lay off a programmer, it's not the same skill set as somebody who has a post-doctorate in AI, so you have to look at the skills that are sought and why,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jos\u00e9, who sits on the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.\n\nBut she said the H-1B isn't without its challenges, pointing to cases in the past at UC San Francisco and Southern California Edison in which U.S. workers were reported displaced by lower-paid H-1B visa holders.\n\nEmployers who hire H-1B workers are required to pay wages at least as much as for similar U.S. professionals, but there are abuses. Lofgren said systemic improvements are needed, including stronger analysis on skill sets for the jobs available and more robust advertising on openings.\n\nWhat's more, workers from India dominate H-1B visas, in part because there are country quotas for permanent immigration, and temporary work visas are seen as a bridge to that, although the wait is often many years.\n\n\"People say the immigration system is broken, and this is part of the brokenness,\" Lofgren said, adding that especially for California, \"our economy is dependent on, and our prosperity is tied to, immigrants.\"\n\nThe acrimony over the H-1B in recent days spiraled after far-right activist Laura Loomer attacked H-1B as a threat to American workers and national security.\n\nShe and other critics of worker visas say they lead to fewer jobs for U.S. workers, but academic research over the years has found little evidence to support that claim overall. And although some laid-off workers have been forced to retire or switch careers, studies have found many have also been re-employed relatively quickly.\n\nFor computer and mathematical occupations, the November unemployment rate was just 2.5%, up from 1.7% a year ago; and it was unchanged at 2% for architectural and engineering occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nLoomer suggested a major clash ahead between immigration hardliners like Stephen Miller, named as Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, and those including Vivek Ramaswamy, the former Republican presidential candidate who, with Musk, has been charged by Trump to cut government spending and regulation.\n\nMusk, the world's richest person who runs Tesla and SpaceX and is himself an immigrant and onetime H-1B visa holder, has come out championing the hiring of skilled foreign workers.\n\nThe visa program has certainly helped Tesla, which this fiscal year received H-1B approvals for 1,765 new and continuing workers, although SpaceX has grown with little benefit from H-1B workers. (Musk moved Tesla's headquarters to Austin from Palo Alto at the end of 2021, and said this year that he was relocating SpaceX to Texas as well.)\n\n\"OF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process,\" Musk wrote on Christmas Day on his social media platform, X. \"However, there is dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America.\"\n\nHe added, \"It comes down to this: do you want America to WIN or do you want America to LOSE. If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"\n\nTrump on Saturday seemed to side with Musk.\n\n\"I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times,\" he told the New York Post. \"It's a great program.\"\n\n(Trump's businesses have predominantly used the H-2B program, which is for temporary seasonal workers that hotels and tourist businesses, for example, make heavy use of during summer. H-2A is for temporary farm workers.)\n\nDespite his record and promises to seal the borders and deport millions of undocumented immigrants, Trump's remarks raised hopes among some immigration advocates that the incoming president could take a softer tack on H-1B visas.\n\nIn his first term, Trump's team made it a lot tougher for employers to get H-1B approvals, and denial rates jumped above 20% in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, triple the average of the prior administration, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a Washington think tank that favors higher levels of immigration.\n\n\"At minimum, it muddies the waters,\" said Stuart Anderson, the group's executive director. \"It could signal a neutral policy rather than a hostile one.\"\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration expert at Cornell Law School, said that despite the deficiencies in H-1B, he believes that \"most employers try to follow the rules. At the macro-level, H-1B workers are helping our economy and creating more jobs for U.S. workers.\"\n\nEntrepreneurs, in particular, have talked about skilled worker visas as being critical for their growth.\n\nYale-Loehr also noted that recent changes have given U.S. immigration officials greater authority to tighten up the H-1B program, including imposing penalties and inspections.\n\nThat could strengthen enforcement and cut down on abuses, if Trump actually follows through on his supportive remarks.\n\n\"It's too early to see. You've got some people in the administration like Elon Musk who want to preserve the H-1B category and other people like Stephen Miller who want to restrict all immigration, including H-1B,\" Yale-Loehr said. \"We'll see which side wins over the four years of the Trump administration.\"\n\n2024 Los Angeles Times.

This innovative visa offers remote workers the chance to explore and work from the vibrant locales of Hualien, Taitung, Tainan, and Pingtung, with a potential stay of up to six months.\n\nIn a move to bolster its economy and attract global talent, Taiwan\u2019s digital nomad visa is part of a broader strategy to make the island a top destination for remote workers in Asia. With similar programs already popular in Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, Taiwan aims to stand out by offering unique incentives and a streamlined path to longer stays and possibly permanent residency.\n\nKey Features of Taiwan\u2019s Digital Nomad Visa\n\nThe primary aim of the new visa is to simplify the residency process for digital nomads, enhancing Taiwan\u2019s appeal as a hub for innovation and economic activity. The government has set ambitious targets to attract 400,000 remote workers by 2032, with special incentives like the potential award of an \u2018Employment Gold Card\u2019 for up to 10,000 qualifying individuals. Additionally, partnerships with regions like Osaka and Fukuoka in Japan, along with various South Korean cities, will offer extended travel options within East Asia.\n\nEligibility and Application Process\n\nTo qualify for Taiwan\u2019s digital nomad visa, applicants must meet specific criteria:\n\nIndividuals aged 30 and older need to show proof of an annual income exceeding USD 60,000 (approximately INR 51.47 lakh) from the previous year.\n\nYounger applicants, aged between 20 and 29, must demonstrate an annual income of at least USD 24,000 (around INR 20.59 lakh).\n\nThose who have previously secured a digital nomad visa from another country may have the review process expedited.\n\nThe visa initially allows for a three-month stay, which can be extended for an additional three months, culminating in a total possible duration of six months in Taiwan.\n\nThis initiative not only opens new vistas for remote workers but also positions Taiwan at the forefront of Asia\u2019s digital nomad movement, promising a blend of cultural richness and professional flexibility.\n\nShare On:",

According to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, in April-September 2024 period, out of the total 1.3 lakh H-1B visas issued to different employers, about 24,766 visas were issued to Indian-origin companies.Out of these, Infosys took the lead with 8,140 beneficiaries, followed by TCS (5,274), and HCL America (2,953).Infosys came second to only Amazon Com Services LLC, which topped with 9,265 visas.(Join our ETNRI WhatsApp channel for all the latest updates) Cognizant , which was founded in Chennai but now has headquarters in New Jersey, ranked third in the list with 6,321 visas.The H1B visa programme allows US companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. Indian companies have been significant beneficiaries of this programme, particularly in the technology sector.Major Indian IT services firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies have consistently ranked among the top employers for H1B visa holders. Wipro was lower down this time with 1,634 visa grants. Tech Mahindra stood close by, having been issued 1,199 visas.While these companies continue to benefit from the programme, ongoing developments indicate a need for adaptation in response to regulatory changes and public sentiment. The future of the H-1B visa will likely depend on balancing the needs of the US businesses for skilled labour with broader immigration policy reforms.Elon Musk, a former H-1B visa holder whose company Tesla utilises this programme, has publicly supported the tech industry's reliance on foreign workers.In a post on X on December 28, Musk emphasised the importance of welcoming individuals from all backgrounds who contribute to the US through hard work. He passionately advocated for preserving America as a land of freedom and opportunity.Musk's statement also received backing from President-elect Donald Trump whose first administration restricted the programme in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.",

            "content": "India has scaled back visa operations in Bangladesh, hitting thousands of patients who visit its hospitals for critical care, and bleeding India\u2019s own medical tourism industry of revenue.\n\nDhaka, Bangladesh \u2013 Khadiza Khatun\u2019s life took a devastating turn in September when doctors at Dhaka Medical College Hospital informed her that her 37-year-old husband, Mohammad Nuri Alam, urgently needed a liver transplant \u2013 a procedure unavailable in Bangladesh.\n\nAfter careful research, they decided to go to India\u2019s Asian Institute of Gastroenterology in Hyderabad, a trusted destination for many Bangladeshi patients.\n\nBut three months later, they are yet to secure visas for the trip. Amid escalating tensions between India and Bangladesh since the August ouster of Sheikh Hasina, an ally of New Delhi\u2019s, from Dhaka, Indian authorities have significantly scaled back visa operations in Bangladesh.\n\nThe result: Khadiza and her husband have already missed two hospital appointments, on November 20 and December 20, and are unsure about whether they\u2019ll be able to get to India in time for January 10, the next date the medical facility in Hyderabad has given them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried everything since October \u2013 approaching travel agencies, seeking help from friends in government,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. \u201cIndia remains our only hope.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaced with unaffordable treatment options in Thailand and other countries, Khadiza is left watching her husband\u2019s health deteriorate while relying on daily symptomatic treatment in Dhaka hospitals \u2013 hoping that the new year will bring her the visas her husband and she desperately need. \u201cI feel helpless, running between hospitals without a solution,\u201d said the mother of two.\n\nKhadiza\u2019s struggle reflects a larger crisis affecting thousands of Bangladeshi patients, who rely on India\u2019s affordable healthcare, because of the visa restrictions introduced by the Indian authorities. The Indian visa centre, on its website, says that it is only \u201coffering limited appointment slots for Bangladesh nationals requiring urgent medical and student visas\u201d and is \u201ccurrently processing only a limited number of visas of emergency and humanitarian nature\u201d.\n\nAccording to an Indian visa centre official in Bangladesh, daily online visa slots across five Indian visa centres in Bangladesh, including Dhaka, have \u201cplummeted to around 500\u201d from over 7,000 since the onset of the protests in July that led to Hasina\u2019s removal from office.\n\nFor many Bangladeshis, like Khadiza, the real likelihood of getting visas feels even slimmer.\n\nThe slide in ties\n\nIndia-Bangladesh relations have deteriorated since Hasina fled the country for New Delhi on August 5 after a weeks-long student-led protest against her increasingly authoritarian rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia has since sheltered Hasina, straining ties \u2013 the interim Bangladesh government of Nobel laureate, Muhammad Yunus, last week sent New Delhi a diplomatic note seeking her extradition.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indian government has told Bangladesh it is concerned about a spate of attacks against Bangladeshi Hindus. Dhaka, on its part, insists that most attacks have been political in nature \u2013 against perceived supporters of Sheikh Hasina \u2013 rather than religious in their character. Bangladesh has also accused Indian media channels of exaggerating the scale of violence against Hindus.\n\nThese tensions between the two governments have also impacted visa issuances. On August 26, a protest broke out at the Indian visa centre in Dhaka over processing delays, after the authority resumed \u201climited operations\u201d in protest-hit Bangladesh on August 13. Across the border, a Bangladeshi diplomatic mission in the northeast Indian city of Agartala was attacked by a mob in early December, prompting a strong protest from Dhaka.\n\nOn January 1, the usually bustling premises of the Indian visa centre in Dhaka appeared nearly deserted. Only a few applicants were waiting to submit their documents. Most applicants received calls to submit their visa applications and fees at the visa centre after manually providing a copy to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka days earlier.\n\nHowever, Khadiza, who followed the same process a month ago, was unsuccessful. A visa centre official told Al Jazeera that the high commission has begun accepting more emergency applications, though online submission options remain limited.\n\nSome Bangladeshis, who delayed their travel to India for treatment as they waited for tensions to ease, are now stuck with expired visas.\n\n\u201cMy and my wife\u2019s visas were valid until December 10, but we didn\u2019t travel then due to tensions over Bangladesh-related issues in India,\u201d said 40-year-old Shariful Islam, from Joypurhat in northwestern Bangladesh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIslam suffers from a lung disease. He and five other family members \u2013 each with their own health issues, including his wife and father \u2013 have for the past four years been travelling regularly to the eastern Indian city of Kolkata and the southern city of Vellore for medical treatment.\n\nIn a rural area of Joypurhat, Ridowan Hossain, who runs a visa support agency, has meanwhile been struggling to secure visa appointment slots for patients, including a cancer patient urgently seeking treatment in India. Over 10 days, he repeatedly attempted to complete the online application process but consistently faced failures at the payment stage, he said.\n\nWhen he called a helpline, he said he was just told to try again.\n\n\u201cI process over 300 Indian visas annually, but I haven\u2019t been able to process a single one since July,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, many Bangladeshi patients are seeking alternative treatment options in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Turkiye.\n\nMazadul Noyon, manager of Suea Noi Fit & Fly, a Bangkok-based medical and tour operator agency, told Al Jazeera that inquiries from Bangladesh have doubled compared to before August. \u201cAlthough around 80 percent of patients consider Thailand after failing to secure an Indian visa, most abandon the idea upon learning of the 10-15 times higher costs in Thailand,\u201d he said.\n\nFor example, the initial treatment cost for Khadiza\u2019s husband \u2013 covering diagnosis, medicine, consultation, and related expenses \u2013 along with travel and accommodation, would range from US$1,000 to US$2,000 in India, compared to at least US$10,000 to US$15,000 in Thailand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a cardiac ring implant, costs in Thailand range from $5,000 to $20,000 \u2013 depending on the hospital, excluding travel and accommodation. In India, $2,000 covers top-quality rings and medical care. The cost of these procedures is even higher in countries like Malaysia, Singapore and Turkiye, making them unaffordable for most Bangladeshis.\n\nA lose-lose situation\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just Bangladeshi patients who are suffering \u2013 India\u2019s \u201cmedical tourism\u201d industry, which offers high-quality treatment to patients from the developing world at relatively lower prices than in the West, has taken a hit too.\n\nIndustry data shows that 60 percent of India\u2019s two million international patients annually are from Bangladesh. However, since late August, the number of Bangladeshi patients has dropped by 80 percent. India\u2019s medical tourism industry was worth an estimated $9bn in 2023.\n\nAmitabha Chattopadhyay, a paediatric cardiologist at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital in Kolkata, told Al Jazeera that his hospital has seen a 5 percent decline in Bangladeshi patients.\n\n\u201cBut the hospitals treating chronic conditions are facing even greater challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nHospitals in Kolkata, the nearest city to Bangladesh and culturally similar, are the worst affected.\n\nAt Peerless Hospital, a 500-bed multi-speciality hospital in Kolkata, daily outpatient visits from Bangladeshi patients have dropped from 150 to under 30, with nearly no admissions, The Print, an Indian digital publication, has reported, citing the hospital\u2019s CEO, Sudipta Mitra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther key impacted hospitals include Narayana Health in Bengaluru, Apollo in Chennai, and Christian Medical College in Vellore, according to Alexander Thomas from the Association of Healthcare Providers of India.\n\nMeanwhile, two hospitals in Kolkata and Tripura reportedly refused Bangladeshi patients, citing alleged disrespect to the Indian flag, further straining ties, according to local news reports in early December.\n\n\u2018Very difficult\u2019\n\nTouhid Hossain, the acting head of Bangladesh\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acknowledged that the country\u2019s patients were struggling because of Indian visa restrictions.\n\n\u201cNot just difficult. It has become very difficult,\u201d Hossain told Al Jazeera.\n\nM Humayun Kabir, a former diplomat and president of Bangladesh Enterprise Institute who previously served at the Bangladesh mission in Kolkata, echoed this sentiment.\n\n\u201cEmergency visas were supposed to be processed, but I\u2019ve received reports otherwise \u2026 It appears there hasn\u2019t much opportunity to obtain [Indian] visas,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBilateral relations appeared to be thawing when Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Dhaka on December 9, marking the first high-level meeting between India and Bangladesh since the recent political changes in Bangladesh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHossain confirmed that Bangladeshi authorities raised visa-related concerns with their Indian counterparts during the visit. \u201cThey assured us that they would increase visa issuance and prioritise urgent cases,\u201d he said.\n\nYet there has been no change so far, say patients and visa agents.\n\nIndia\u2019s Foreign Ministry and the High Commission of India in Dhaka did not respond to a request from Al Jazeera for comments on the criticism of New Delhi over visa restrictions.\n\nBut during a meeting with diplomatic correspondents in Dhaka on December 24, Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma claimed that India\u2019s visa issuance in Bangladesh still surpasses that of \u201cprobably all other embassies combined\u201d.\n\nHe also said that he remains optimistic about the future of Dhaka-New Delhi relations \u2013 a sentiment that Hossain, the de facto foreign minister of Bangladesh, echoed when speaking with Al Jazeera.\n\nAnalysts, however, remain sceptical.\n\n\u201cBoth parties speak about good relations, but the reality suggests otherwise,\u201d said Snigdhendu Bhattacharya, an independent Indian journalist specialising in South Asian issues.\n\nKabir, the retired Bangladesh diplomat, said he hoped the two governments would be able to insulate visa issuances from their broader diplomatic tensions.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, the neighbours could face consequences, he cautioned.\n\n\u201cSuch stances create a negative mindset among the public and can harm long-term people-to-people relations,\u201d Kabir said.\n\nBut Khadiza doesn\u2019t have the luxury of waiting much longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe visa support agency still hasn\u2019t submitted the application,\u201d she said, her voice heavy with disappointment. She\u2019s mentally preparing herself for the update that the application couldn\u2019t be submitted \u2013 even as the clock ticks away for Alam, her husband.",

So how many H-1B visa holders are there in Mississippi? Where do most of them work? Here's what we know.\n\nRecently, President-elect Donald Trump backed Elon Musk in a debate over the work program. Some Trump supporters were taking a hard anti-immigration stance.\n\nMusk, a naturalized U.S. citizen from South Africa, at one point had an H-1B visa and vowed to go to \"war\" over the issue. (Melania Trump immigrated to the U.S. using an EB-1 visa, commonly called the Einstein Visa.)\n\nTrump has, in the past, said he plans to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, throttle immigration and put tariffs on goods to drive American industries. However, he's also said he's willing to provide more visas to workers with needed skills.\n\nWhat is an H-1B visa?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, the program is for people who want to come to the U.S. temporarily \"as workers in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability.\"\n\nA specialty occupation is defined as needing highly-specific knowledge, requiring a bachelor's degree or the same level of education. The goal is to help businesses fill positions they can't out of available U.S. workers with foreign nationals who aren't approved to work in the country outside of the specific approvals.\n\nH-1B workers are supposed to be paid the same as a similarly qualified American citizens.

            "content": "Many small businesses are breathing a bit easier as inflation has cooled and the race for workers slows. But consumers\u2019 steady embrace of credit cards is taking a growing bite out of their margins.\n\nGene-Christian Baca, the owner of Walter\u2019s Hot Dogs in Mamaroneck and White Plains, New York, estimated that he now pays $50,000 a year in costs associated with processing credit card transactions, a sum he says has ballooned with rising card processing rates and more customers paying with cards over cash.\n\n\u201cEvery year, 3% of all of our sales is washed away just to credit card processing,\u201d he said.\n\nA Visa credit card inserted into a card reader in Tiskilwa, Ill., on Sept. 18, 2018. Daniel Acker / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nMerchants have long shouldered these \u201cswipe fees,\u201d the catchall term for businesses\u2019 payments to banks and card companies each time customers swipe. While a federal rule caps debit card swipe fees at 21 cents per transaction, those for credit cards can be much higher.\n\nAnd as many shoppers ditched cash for plastic cards or mobile payment apps, businesses have seen credit card transactions swell. They made up 32% of all U.S. consumer payments in 2023, up from 24% in 2019, according to a Federal Reserve study. Cash shrunk its share to 16% over the same period, down from 26%.\n\nSpending on American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa cards in the U.S. soared to $5.25 trillion in the first half of 2024, up from around $4.98 trillion during the same period in 2023, according to data provided to NBC News by the Nilson Report, which covers the payments industry.\n\nThese shifts in customer habits have added to many businesses\u2019 costs. Merchants paid an average of 2.26% in swipe fees for transactions using the Visa and Mastercard credit card networks in 2023, the latest year with available data, according to Nilson. The two companies accounted for more than $100 billion of the $172 billion in total U.S. swipe fees in 2023, Nilson said, and Visa accounted for 52% of credit card spending on the four major card networks.\n\nSome of Visa\u2019s fees are now going up. The card network raised two of the credit card swipe fees it charges banks and processing companies on Jan. 1. The move comes amid growing pushback from critics, including some lawmakers, who say swipe fees are excessive and frequently get passed on to shoppers.\n\n\u201cMost likely, higher swipe fees from Visa would mean higher prices for people at the store eventually,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear as to how quickly that would happen, but generally speaking, when these fees tend to go up, merchants would tend to pass those extra costs along to consumers.\u201d\n\nThe Merchants Payments Coalition, an advocacy organization backed by leading restaurant, retail and other trade groups, estimates Visa\u2019s additional fees will total $100 million per year.\n\n\u201cThat seems like not a lot, but it increases the amount of every single transaction, and that really adds up over time,\u201d said Doug Kantor, a member of the Merchants Payments Coalition\u2019s executive committee and general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores.\n\nThe Merchants Payments Coalition says the $172 billion in swipe fees in 2023 set a record and estimates they cost the average family more than $1,100. The group is pushing for more transparency with credit card fees, more competition among networks and lower fees.\n\nVisa says its changes are meant to make the network better. When confronted by policymakers about some of its swipe fees, the company has said that it \u201chas no incentive to set [them] at levels that are too high or too low.\u201d\n\nA Visa spokesperson told NBC News in a statement: \u201cWe are constantly enhancing our network to better serve the businesses and consumers that increasingly choose to transact with us. Everything we do is designed to make paying and being paid with Visa more convenient, secure and reliable.\u201d\n\nThe Electronic Payments Coalition, an advocacy group supporting card networks including Visa, says average swipe fees haven\u2019t changed much over the last decade even as sales have increased. The organization has also noted that businesses incur distinct costs by handling cash. Those can range from operating cash registers to paying bank account fees.\n\nBusinesses handle swipe fees differently. Some, like Walter\u2019s Hot Dogs, bake the costs into their prices. Others are trying to entice customers to use cash. Patz Deli in Manchester, New Hampshire, charges customers a 4% convenience fee for credit card transactions to cover the costs of processing fees and credit card equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cost that we don\u2019t necessarily have to take on ourselves because it\u2019s not our credit card,\u201d said owner Pat Burns. \u201cIt\u2019s your choice to use it, not ours, but we\u2019re the ones who get charged for it.\u201d\n\nHe said the deli introduced the convenience fee within the last couple of years as it faced mounting pressure from taxes, wages and other expenses.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the month, by the time you bring home any type of money, 10 other people have already had their hands in it,\u201d Burns said. \u201cEven just a little bit like on the credit cards, 3, 4% goes a long way helping small businesses stay afloat.\u201d\n\nConsumer experts recommend using cash for small transactions, using rewards cards to make the most of each purchase and paying in person rather than over the phone when possible. Phone transactions often result in a higher fee for businesses due to security risks.\n\nThe fight over swipe fees has reached Congress. The Credit Card Competition Act, a bipartisan bill spearheaded by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Roger Marshall, R-Kan., aims to boost competition among credit card processing companies \u2014 something the Merchants Payments Coalition says is essential.\n\nBut the bill has stalled. Several groups supporting banks, credit card networks and credit unions are opposing the measure, saying it would harm small businesses and consumers, in part by limiting rewards.\n\n\u201cSwipe fees are definitely a really contentious thing and have been a battlefield between credit card issuers and networks and merchants for a long time,\u201d said LendingTree\u2019s Schulz. \u201cIt feels like that battle is really only going to keep going on for the next little while.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is taking aim at the controversial H-1B visa program, arguing that it replaces \"good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad\" \u2014 just as the program is at the center of a debate within the Republican Party.\n\n\"The main function of the H-1B visa program and other guest worker initiatives is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,\" Sanders wrote on X. \"The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.\"\n\nThe self-described democratic socialist has a history of opposing the program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers for specialty occupations. It is predominantly used by the tech industry, but has faced criticism mainly from the right that it brings in cheap labor from abroad to replace American workers.\n\nTRUMP SAYS HE'S NOT CHANGED HIS MIND ON H-1B VISAS AS DEBATE RAGES WITHIN MAGA COALITION\n\nThe program recently became part of an intra-Republican debate when Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been tapped by Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, argued for the importance of foreign workers for tech companies.\n\n\"The reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,\" Musk said on X.\n\nThat reopened a rift between those on the right over the program and whether it is being used to attract the best talent or being used by companies to bring in cheaper labor, primarily from India, who are tied to their job by the visa.\n\nSanders cited statistics to show that in 2022 and 2023, the top 30 corporations using the program laid off over 85,000 American workers, while hiring over 34,000 H-1B workers, and that 33% of new IT jobs are filled by foreign national guest workers. He also pointed to layoffs at Tesla, one of Musk\u2019s companies.\n\nERIC SCHMITT BLASTS \u2018ABUSE\u2019 OF H-1B VISA PROGRAM, SAYS AMERICANS \u2018SHOULDN\u2019T TRAIN THEIR FOREIGN REPLACEMENTS'\n\n\"If this program is really supposed to be about importing workers with highly advanced degrees in science and technology, why are H-1B guest workers being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers?\" he said. \"Can we really not find English teachers in America?\"\n\nSanders conceded that there may be labor shortages that could be filled by H-1B workers, but he called for substantially increased guest worker fees in order to pay for opportunities for Americans, as well as other reforms, including increased minimum wages and the ability to easily move jobs.\n\n\"Bottom line. It should never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker,\" he said.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO CHANGE H-1B GUEST WORKER PROGRAM TO PRIORITIZE HIGHER-WAGE APPLICANTS\n\nSanders said that the \"economic elite and political establishments\" promised in the 1990s that a loss of blue-collar jobs due to free trade agreements would be offset by more white-collar IT jobs.\n\n\"Well, that turned out to be a Big Lie. Not only have corporations exported millions of blue-collar manufacturing jobs to China, Mexico, and other low-wage countries, they are now importing hundreds of thousands of low-paid guest workers from abroad to fill the white-collar technology jobs that are available,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSanders comments come days after President-elect Trump, who had railed against H-1B abuse during the 2016 campaign, said that he has always supported the program.\n\n\"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It\u2019s a great program,\" he told the New York Post.",

This comes amid a heated debate over H-1B visas, with President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk recently weighing in.\n\nIn a recent post, Mr. Musk defended the H-1B visa programme on social media, \"The reason I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.\"\n\n\"I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend\", he added.\n\nThe debate has exposed deep divisions among Mr. Trump's allies, with some supporting the H-1B visa programme as essential for the tech industry, while others see it as a threat to American jobs. Mr. Trump himself has expressed support for the programme, despite previously signing an executive order to restrict access to such visas.\n\nIndia's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, highlighted the strong economic and technological partnership between the two countries, noting that the mobility of skilled professionals is a crucial component. He emphasised that India-US economic ties benefit greatly from the technical expertise provided by these professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value.\n\n\"Our countries have a strong and growing economic and technological partnership and within this ambit, mobility of skilled professionals is an important component,\" Mr. Jaiswal, told a press conference when asked about the H-1B visa discussions in the U.S.\n\n\"India-U.S economic ties benefit a lot from the technical expertise provided by skilled professionals, with both sides leveraging their strengths and competitive value. We look forward to further deepening India-U.S economic ties which are to our mutual benefit\u201d, he added.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves: India received approximately 78% of the 265,777 H1B visas issued by the US in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. This underscores the significant role Indian professionals play in the US tech industry.\n\nMr. Trump has expressed full support for the H1B program, despite opposition from some of his supporters. Mr. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has also vowed to defend the program, stating he's willing to go to \"war\" for it.\n\nAs the US and India look to strengthen their ties under Mr. Trump, India's foreign minister Dr S Jaishankar has already met with Mr. Trump's transition team. The country is eager to deepen its economic ties with the US, recognising the mutual benefits that arise from their partnership.\n\nThis development is part of a broader trend of growing US-India cooperation, with bilateral trade increasing by 7.65% to USD 129 billion in 2022-23.\n\nUltimately, the movement of skilled professionals between India and the US is a critical aspect of their economic and technological partnership. As both nations continue to navigate the complexities of this relationship, it's clear that mutual benefits and cooperation will remain a top priority.\n\n",

In a statement released on January 2, Sanders stated, \"There has been a lot of discussion lately about the H-1B guest worker program. Elon Musk and a number of other billionaire tech company owners have argued that this federal program is vital to our economy because of the scarcity of highly skilled American engineers and other tech workers. I disagree.\"\n\nWhile proponents argue the program addresses a shortage of highly skilled American workers, Sanders characterized it as a tool to replace well-paying domestic jobs with lower-wage foreign labor. Sanders asserted, \u201cThe main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad.\u201d\n\nCorporate layoffs and guest worker hiring under scrutiny Sanders highlighted data showing that major corporations utilizing the H-1B program laid off at least 85,000 American workers in 2022 and 2023, while hiring over 34,000 H-1B workers. Tesla, he noted, laid off 7,500 workers, including engineers and software developers, but was approved to employ thousands of H-1B workers. \u201cIf there\u2019s truly a shortage of skilled workers, why are we seeing these layoffs?\u201d Sanders questioned.\n\nJobs filled by H-1B workers questioned The senator also raised concerns about the types of roles filled by H-1B workers. He cited examples such as associate accountants earning $58,000 and material planners making $80,000 annually. \u201cThese don\u2019t sound like highly specialized jobs for the top 0.1 percent,\u201d Sanders remarked, countering claims by tech leaders like Elon Musk.\n\nBroader misuse of H-1B program highlighted Sanders pointed out that the program is being used to fill roles such as dog trainers, massage therapists, and English teachers, questioning whether such jobs genuinely require foreign talent. \u201cCan we really not find English teachers in America?\u201d he asked.\n\nProposed reforms to protect American workers Sanders called for significant reforms to the H-1B program, including raising the minimum wage for guest workers, ensuring they can switch jobs easily, and requiring corporations to prioritize hiring American workers. He also proposed increasing guest worker fees to fund scholarships and job training for American workers. \u201cIt should never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker,\u201d Sanders emphasized.\n\nEconomic inequality at the core of the debate The senator linked the misuse of the H-1B program to broader issues of economic inequality. \u201cAt a time when the richest three people in America own more wealth than the bottom half of our country, we need an economy that works for all, not just the few,\u201d Sanders stated.\n\nA call for long-term solutions Sanders urged a focus on strengthening America\u2019s education system to produce a well-educated workforce capable of meeting the country\u2019s needs in various fields, including technology, healthcare, and skilled trades. \u201cThe answer is not to bring in cheap labor from abroad. The answer is to hire qualified American workers first,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThis latest statement intensifies the debate over the H-1B program, placing pressure on lawmakers and corporations to address concerns about labor practices and economic fairness.\n\nH-1B visa debate heats up ahead of Trump inauguration With just three weeks until Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th President of the United States on January 20, the debate over the H-1B visa program for highly skilled foreign professionals has intensified, causing rifts within both Democratic and Republican ranks. The program, which grants 65,000 visas annually, along with an additional 20,000 for those holding advanced US degrees, has become a flashpoint in discussions on immigration and job security.\n\nTrump voices support for H-1B visas President-elect Trump has expressed his backing for the program, stating in an interview with the New York Post, \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the visas. I have always been in favor of the visas. That\u2019s why we have them.\u201d His remarks align with his vision of fostering innovation and attracting global talent to the US.\n\nKey advisors advocate for program Two of Trump\u2019s close allies, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been selected to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency, also champion the H-1B program. Both have emphasized its importance in filling critical gaps in specialized industries. \u201cThe U.S. falls short in many of the specialized fields,\u201d Musk and Ramaswamy argued, highlighting the program\u2019s role in maintaining the country\u2019s competitive edge.",

            "content": "The ideological divide within the American right over work visas has taken a new turn with Donald Trump publicly siding with proponents of the H-1B visa program in an interview with the New York Post.\n\nFor Greek students and young professionals aspiring to work in the United States\u2014and for countless other foreign professionals\u2014the future remains uncertain, with no clear resolution in sight for at least the next four years.\n\nAt the heart of this uncertainty lies a deep divide within Trump\u2019s circle over legal immigration policy. The chasm between two factions\u2014the tech-focused entrepreneurs who support the H-1B visa program and the populist right opposed to its expansion\u2014seems insurmountable.\n\nCurrently, it appears the \u201ctech bros\u201d\u2014executives from startups and tech giants like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy\u2014hold the upper hand. They argue that the H-1B visa, designed for skilled immigrants, bolsters economic growth and innovation, especially during a period of heightened competition with China.\n\nOpposing them are stalwart members of the populist right, including figures like Laura Loomer, Ann Coulter, and Steve Bannon, who fiercely argue against the program, citing its threat to American workers.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent endorsement of the H-1B program set a direction for his faction but failed to resolve the debate. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of Trump\u2019s rise to power has been his focus on the economic effects of immigration,\u201d said Matthew Boyle, Washington bureau chief of Breitbart News, in an interview with To Vima.\n\n\u201cThere used to be a broad bipartisan consensus that increasing the labor supply decreases wages for American workers. Over the past few decades, however, our political class in America\u2014both major parties\u2014has abandoned this debate in favor of simply increasing immigration, largely to satisfy big business and special interests,\u201d Boyle explained.\n\n\u201cThe debate you are seeing now among various factions on the American right is a healthy return to the forefront of this discussion. This is not an anti-immigration versus pro-immigration debate. Rather than serving special interests our immigration policy should serve the interests of the American working class.\u201d\n\nThe Role of the H-1B Visa\n\nThe H-1B visa program is pivotal for international professionals, including Greek students pursuing advanced degrees in the U.S. The visa is specifically granted to individuals with specialized skills and is often used to fill roles in large companies.\n\nHowever, obtaining the visa is no small feat. A convoluted process, steep legal fees, prolonged delays, and the lottery-based system often discourage employers.\n\nStavros Piperidis, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, highlighted the growing hesitation among employers. \u201cThis uncertainty began as early as April. I know students who have graduated but are stuck in limbo. Companies are waiting for clarity on immigration policies before making long-term decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nSpyros Spiromilios, a student at Georgetown University, offered a more optimistic perspective. \u201cMeritocracy is deeply ingrained in American culture. No administration will entirely close the door to skilled immigrants,\u201d he said. \u201cObtaining an H-1B visa isn\u2019t a right; it\u2019s a privilege. If opportunities narrow, it will ensure that only the most competitive candidates remain, ultimately benefiting the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nA Program Under Scrutiny\n\nThe H-1B program\u2019s future has also drawn criticism for alleged abuses. Former Congressman Bruce Morrison, one of the architects of the 1990 Immigration Act that introduced the H1-B visa program, expressed disappointment in how the program has evolved\n\nMorrison explained that the original purpose of the H-1B visa program was to bring foreign workers to the U.S. to contribute their expertise to the economy. However, he argued that companies have increasingly used the program to replace higher-paid American workers with cheaper foreign labor, while many foreign workers seek to secure permanent resident status through a non-immigrant visa.",

Because there is no grace period, a preview version of the new form is available for employers to review on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 (USCIS) website here.\n\nThe H-1B nonimmigrant visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree in the specific specialty, or its equivalent.\n\nThe final rule aims to provide greater flexibilities for employers and workers by modernizing the criteria for specialty occupation positions as well as for nonprofit and governmental research organizations that are exempt from the annual statutory limit on H-1B visas.\n\nThe changes are intended to help U.S. employers hire the employees needed for their business and remain competitive in the global marketplace. The rule also extends flexibility for students on an F-1 visa seeking to change their status to H-1B to avoid disruptions in lawful status and employment authorization for those F-1 students.\n\nTo improve program efficiency, the final rule will allow USCIS to process applications more quickly for most individuals who had previously been approved for an H1B visa. It will also allow H-1B beneficiaries with a controlling interest in the petitioning organization to be eligible for H-1B status subject to reasonable conditions.\n\nThe rule strengthens oversight by codifying USCIS\u2019 authority to conduct inspections and impose penalties. It also clarifies that the specialty occupation standard requires a direct connection between the required degree and the duties of the position.\n\n\u201cThe H-1B program was created by Congress in 1990, and there\u2019s no question it needed to be modernized to support our nation\u2019s growing economy,\u201d USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou said Dec. 17. \u201cThe changes made in today\u2019s final rule will ensure that U.S. employers can hire the highly skilled workers they need to grow and innovate while enhancing the integrity of the program.\u201d\n\nH-1Bs are subject to a numerical cap that does not meet demand, which is why the USCIS conducts a lottery to select beneficiaries for the H-1B visas. Employers must submit an H-1B cap registration in March 2025 for each worker it intends to enter in the H-1B lottery for FY 2026.\n\nNJBIA will present an HR program on Jan. 30 with Connell Foley attorneys Victoria A. Donoghue and Abigail J. Walsh that will explore the H-1B program and immigration alternatives for employers who are unsuccessful in the H-1B lottery.

            "content": "On Dec. 18, 2024, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced a final rule introducing significant changes to the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program. This rule aims to modernize the H-1B process, improve program efficiency, offer new benefits and flexibilities, and implement enhanced integrity measures. While the changes primarily affect H-1B specialty occupation workers, other nonimmigrant classifications, including H-2, H-3, F-1, L-1, O, P, Q-1, R-1, E-3 and TN categories, will also see impacts.\n\nKey Updates\n\nThe new H-1B eligibility requirements and accompanying changes will apply to petitions filed on or after Jan. 17, 2025. At that time, USCIS will require a revised Form I-129 for all filings. A preview of the updated form is currently available on the USCIS website.\n\nIn response to public comments, USCIS highlighted several key revisions and removals from the proposed rule (NPRM) in the final regulation. One significant change involves the definition of \u201cspecialty occupation.\u201d The proposed rule previously specified that if a petitioner required only a general degree, such as \u201cbusiness administration\u201d or \u201cliberal arts,\u201d without further specialization, the occupation would not qualify as an H-1B \u201cspecialty occupation.\u201d References to these degrees were removed in the final rule. This change shifts focus to the \u201cbeneficiary\u2019s actual course of study\u201d rather than solely the degree title, emphasizing the relevance of the education to the job.\n\nUnder the final rule, a position qualifies as an H-1B \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d if it requires the theoretical and practical application of highly specialized knowledge and mandates at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a \u201cdirectly related\u201d specific specialty or its equivalent. A \u201cdirectly related\u201d degree is defined as one with a \u201clogical connection between the required degree and the duties of the position.\u201d\n\nFor positions where a bachelor\u2019s degree in a specific specialty is \u201cnormally\u201d the minimum requirement, petitioners do not need to prove that it is always the minimum. DHS clarified that \u201cnormal\u201d is interpreted as \u201cusual, typical, common, or routine,\u201d and rejected a proposal to use the preponderance of the evidence standard (\u201cmore likely than not\u201d) for this determination.\n\nWhen petitioners specify a range of acceptable degree fields, they must demonstrate that each field is \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the job\u2019s duties. Each degree must equip the beneficiary with the specialized knowledge required to perform the job. The petitioner bears the burden of proving how each field of study represents a \u201cspecific specialty\u201d directly connected to the position\u2019s responsibilities.\n\nUSCIS has also updated the requirements for H-1B cap exemptions. Nonprofit and governmental research organizations must now demonstrate that research is a \u201cfundamental activity\u201d rather than their primary mission.\n\nTo qualify for the ACWIA fee exemption, a nonprofit organization must now be recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as tax-exempt under sections 501(c)(3), (c)(4) or (c)(6). Previously, regulations required that nonprofits not only be tax-exempt under these IRS sections but also have specifically obtained IRS approval for tax-exempt status for research or educational purposes.\n\nUSCIS has removed the requirement for detailed itineraries covering the full validity period of the petition. However, petitioners must still establish that the position will exist as of the start date. For third-party placements, specialty occupation requirements will now be based on the job criteria of the third-party organization. Supporting evidence such as contracts, statements of work, or client letters will remain necessary.\n\nExpanded authority for site visits will allow USCIS to inspect not only petitioner worksites but also third-party locations and private residences where remote work occurs. Refusal to cooperate during site visits may lead to petition denial or revocation.\n\nAmended petition requirements have been clarified to codify existing guidance, including when new Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) are unnecessary (e.g., for short-term placements). USCIS has also codified its deference policy, meaning prior determinations involving the same parties and facts will generally be deferred to, barring material errors, changes or new adverse information.\n\nUnder the new rule, H-1B Cap-Gap extensions may continue until April 1 of the fiscal year for which the non-frivolous petition was filed or until the start date of the H-1B petition if approved, whichever occurs first. Previously, H-1B Cap-Gap extensions lasted until Sept. 30, the day before the start of the fiscal year associated with the petition.\n\nThe new rule under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(ii) adds a provision for H-1B petitions approved after the requested validity period. USCIS may issue an RFE allowing petitioners to amend the dates. If the new dates exceed the Labor Condition Application (LCA) validity, a new LCA must be submitted. Changes to employment dates or wage increases are not considered material changes if the position remains the same. If no amendment is requested or no RFE is issued/replied to, the petition is approved for the original period without status changes or extensions.\n\nAction Items\n\nWe recommend that clients review current and planned filings in light of these new rules. For those with upcoming H-1B or other nonimmigrant petitions, it is critical to prepare for the changes to eligibility requirements, updated forms and enhanced compliance measures.\n\n[View source.]",

            "content": "Government\n\nThe Need for H-1B Visa Workers\n\nTaking part in the H-1B Visa process is essential for companies that want to remain innovative and competitive today.\n\nBy Lisa Goulian Twiste, Contributing Writer On Jan 3, 2025\n\nForeign workers are critical to the health and growth of US businesses, particularly in New Jersey\u2019s concentrated market of pharmaceutical, engineering, technology, and other innovative industries. In 2024, there were roughly 5,000 New Jersey companies sponsoring H-1B visas, which are nonimmigrant visas allowing foreign workers to fill specialty occupations in the US for up to six years. These companies range from Teaneck-based Cognizant Technology Solutions with 1,081 non-citizens employees, to accounting giant Ernst & Young with 850, to hundreds of others across the state employing one or a handful of H-1B workers. With just over 20% of college students graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in the STEM fields, the US lags well behind China (40%) and India (34%), so competing on the world stage means bringing in talent from these and other tech-heavy countries.\n\n\u201cThe state of New Jersey does have a tremendous number of H-1Bs because this is where the worldwide brain drain begins,\u201d says David Nachman, Esq., managing attorney at the Nachman Phulwani Zimovcak (NPZ) Law Group (VISASERVE). \u201cThis is where you\u2019ll find large corporations looking for refined and highly specialized skillsets. With more remote work going on across the country, people are also working in other places, while feeding the tax base and economy in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nNeeding this talent is one thing; getting it here is another. H-1B workers \u2013 chosen each year through a random lottery \u2013 are capped at 65,000 annually for those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or its US equivalent, plus an additional 20,000 for those with a US advanced degree (master\u2019s or higher). These numbers are established by the Immigration Act of 1990 and H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004, respectively.\n\n\u201cIt boggles my mind that we talk about getting the best and the brightest here to the US, but rather than opening it up and letting it be a free market endeavor, the government has established a cap system,\u201d Nachman says. \u201cWhen I go to work, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m immigrating individuals; I\u2019m competing against the other countries like the UK, Australia, Canada, and India that are opening their doors to get these highly skilled people to their countries because those governments know it\u2019s going to add to their economic infrastructure.\u201d\n\nRegistration Based on Individuals\n\nWhile the H-1B cap system is restrictive, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is working to make it more equitable. When H-1B registrations ballooned to 758,000 for the 2024 cap year \u2013 a 140% increase over 2023 \u2013 USCIS implemented a new rule that each person is entered into the lottery once, regardless of how many employer registrations are submitted on their behalf.\n\n\u201cCompanies were gaming the system, using staffing agencies to increase the number of entries for the same person,\u201d Nachman says. \u201cThe new process, which is \u2018individual centric,\u2019 almost cut the number of entries in half to about 450,000. We\u2019ve rooted out the fraud, and the government is slowly learning.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, USCIS has raised the H-1B cap lottery registration fee from $10 to $215 effective for the 2026 fiscal year cap season beginning in March. According to Mark Harley, an immigration lawyer with Fox Rothschild, this significant increase may not deter larger companies, but might be too much for startups with limited resources.\n\n\u201cIncreased government fees are not usually positive, but it may cut back on some employers filing hundreds or even thousands of registrations,\u201d Harley says. \u201cAnother positive change in recent years is that you don\u2019t have to file the paperwork for all H-1B petitions, but only those that have been selected under the registration lottery, which is a lot easier and economical for employers and the attorney as well.\u201d\n\nTechnology Issues\n\nIn recent years, USCIS has been making reforms, such as creating an online H-1B registration system, and the agency now offers an optional online system where employers and legal representatives can create, review and submit H-1B petitions, moving the process to a more digital format. Prior to this, H-1Bs were all filed on paper and then uploaded to USCIS Processing Centers.\n\nAs things become more automated, however, problems have arisen to slow the process. For example, there was a glitch in the registration system last year that caused missing signatures on Form G-28 and the registration filing deadline being moved back three days as the error was addressed.\n\nAlternatives to the H-1B\n\nStill, with just about 25% of H-1B applicants accepted, employers in various tech fields are often forced to seek other methods of bringing foreign talent to the US. According to Jessica Cook, a partner in the Fisher Phillips Immigration Practice Group, this can include alternative visa categories, depending on the person\u2019s citizenship, credentials, and intended employment.\n\n\u201cCitizens of Canada and Mexico may be eligible for the TN visa. Australian citizens coming to the US to work in a professional position may qualify for the E-3 visa,\u201d Cook says. \u201cIndividuals with extraordinary ability in their field, such as sciences, business, art, or education can apply for the O-1 visa. And individuals working for an international company may be able transfer to the company\u2019s US operations using the L-1 visa.\u201d\n\nThe O-1 visa is a viable path for about 75% of applicants who don\u2019t get H-1Bs through the lottery, Nachman says. Issuance of O-1s went from 15,415 issued in 2020 to 38,782 in 2023, with between 80% and 95% of applications accepted, which he attributes to the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cbackdoor understanding\u201d of the need to bring foreign workers to the US, also noting the process is likely to tighten up with Donald Trump\u2019s return to office in January.\n\n\u201cWith Donald Trump elected again, we should expect to see new restrictions on the H-1B visa,\u201d Cook adds. \u201cSimilar to his first term, we should expect to see H-1B restrictions resulting in increases in H-1B requests for evidence and denials. Trump may also try to revive some H-1B rules developed during his first term that the courts blocked.\u201d The Trump changes would have narrowed the definition of \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d eligible for H-1B visas, shortened visa terms from three years to one year, and enhanced the DHS\u2019s enforcement abilities.\n\nAcademia and Other Avenues\n\nSkilled foreign workers seeking an H-1B can also look at academic institutions, which are cap-exempt and offer positions in finance, IT, and marketing, among others. This includes not-for-profit companies affiliated with academia, hospitals affiliated with medical schools, and government research organizations. And a new USCIS ruling that came out early last year seeks to implement an even more liberal interpretation for this cap-exemption. An academic institution can sponsor a student to do research 5 to 10 hours a week, allowing them to fill in the other 30 to 35 hours with a company like Amazon or Google.\n\nIt\u2019s always about getting more skilled people into the workforce in the US \u2013 and New Jersey, specifically \u2013 through any legal immigration-related means possible, Nachman says, adding, \u201cWe may be in the shadow of New York, Philadelphia, and Silicon Valley, but New Jersey is a major industrial hub. I was born and bred in New Jersey, and our practice is based here, so our staff feels a dedication to ensuring these folks get here and bring what they can to help us to build and solidify New Jersey\u2019s economic infrastructure.\u201d\n\nTo access more business news, visit NJB News Now.\n\nRelated Articles:",

Sign up to get the free Capitolized newsletter delivered to your inbox every Thursday.\n\nJanuary 2, 2025\n\nReining in illegal immigration ranks as a top priority for Montana\u2019s now entirely Republican federal delegation as they head to Washington, D.C., for the next Congress.\n\nThe immigration drumbeat by Republicans in elections since 2016 is that Montana, to borrow a phrase from U.S. Sen Steve Daines, is a \u201cnorthern border state with a southern border problem.\u201d That concern is, however, complicated by Montana\u2019s increasing reliance on foreign labor.\n\nThe year just ended with a flurry of national attention paid to visas for professional workers, or H-1B work permits, as Elon Musk argued with anti-immigration Republicans on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter about the need for H-1Bs to compensate for a dearth of skilled tech workers.\n\nThe number of foreign workers sought by employers in Montana has nearly doubled since 2016. In 2024, employers applied for about 3,000 visa positions.\n\nOf the approximately 11 million immigrants living in the country without legal permission, about 42% are people who have overstayed visas instead of crossing one of the nation\u2019s borders illegally, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nVisa policy is usually adjusted in the contents of border security bills, which some Republicans have attempted to use to increase the costs and the level of scrutiny for visa applications \u2014 as Daines has done by cosponsoring visa bills for the past two years.\n\nThe big growth in Montana was in demand for H-2B visas, which are for non-agricultural jobs, skilled and unskilled, but without the educational degrees required for H-1Bs, the visa form at the center of the late-year debate between Musk and immigration hardliners.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2024, the number of H-2Bs sought for Montana jobs increased from 146 to 1,178. The biggest increase behind that growth was the number of out-of-state businesses intending to place H-2B workers in Montana. There were nine H-2B applications submitted by out-of-state businesses specifically to locate workers at Montana worksites in 2018. Typically, each application covers multiple workers. In 2024, the number of applications had risen to 43.\n\nGallatin County attracted the most requests for H-2B workers, with businesses applying for 596 workers in the last federal fiscal year, mostly tied to construction, landscaping and lodging. On the upper end, the pay range for those positions is more than $20 an hour.\n\nThe largest number of applications, 658, came from agricultural and forestry businesses. Farms and ranches have relied on foreign workers for decades and are still awarded the most initial approvals, 1,676 in 2024.\n\nThe number of farms and ranches with a stake in immigration policy drew one of the only non-secure-our-borders messages of the 2024 election cycle. Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester drew the endorsement of a former president of the conservative Montana Farm Bureau Federation, Hans McPherson, specifically for supporting a 13% increase in the number of employment visas. McPherson told Montana Free Press he didn\u2019t consider border security and access to foreign workers to be the same issue.\n\nHowever, spending from groups supporting business-friendly visa terms lined up for Republican Tim Sheehy, who won the election on a platform that focused on the U.S.-Mexico border, but not visas, or the unauthorized immigrants who overstay their work permits.\n\nSpecifically, Craig Duchossois, whose family once had majority ownership of Churchill Downs, gave $250,000 to More Jobs Less Government, a PAC created to advocate for Sheehy\u2019s election. Duchossois serves on the board of the American Business Council, which advocates for \u201cthe integration of immigrants into our economy as consumers, workers, entrepreneurs and citizens.\u201d\n\nIn Montana, visas for degreed professionals, H-1Bs, are typically related to jobs in rural areas that applicants say aren\u2019t attracting U.S. citizens. That\u2019s according to information from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSix rural school districts in eastern Montana were approved for 13 H-1B workers, with Brockton School District on Fort Peck Reservation receiving more than half. Lump in Montana\u2019s universities, and education is the largest sector requesting H-1Bs.\n\nHealth care providers also rely on H-1Bs. Rural medical providers in 10 Montana counties applied for H-1Bs in the last federal fiscal year, which ended in September, as did Montana\u2019s largest medical hubs, for 33 statewide.\n\nSeven different Montana scientific and technical businesses and a large financial services business in Great Falls also sought highly-skilled workers, though the asks were smaller than requests from rural schools and health care providers.\n\n\u2014Tom Lutey\n\nWill they have to reapply?\n\nWhen the Legislature convenes Jan. 6, one particular thing to watch for is whether the state Senate moves to reconfirm department heads who are holdovers from Gov. Greg Gianforte\u2019s first term \u2014 and whether those confirmations are held back from final approval until late in the session in a potential attempt to use them as negotiating leverage.\n\nPer the Montana Constitution, department heads appointed by the governor are subject to confirmation vote by the state\u2019s 50 senators, and then \u201chold office until the end of the governor\u2019s term unless sooner removed by the governor.\u201d That language has historically left it somewhat ambiguous about what happens when a reelected governor like Gianforte wants to keep some department heads previously confirmed by the Senate.\n\nLawmakers sometimes suggest those holdovers should be put through another round of confirmation scrutiny. Reelected governors have been known to bristle in response.\n\nSen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, recalled to Senate lawmakers in December being told to \u201cpound sand\u201d by Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer when the majority-Republican Legislature indicated that his first-term picks would need confirmation again if they were to serve for Schweitzer\u2019s second term, which ran from 2009 to 2013.\n\nOne Republican legislator told Capitolized that such confirmations might come late in the 2025 session \u2014 only after Gianforte\u2019s directors have proven responsive to issues raised by lawmakers.\n\nEsp told Capitolized his only interest this year is in making sure the department heads are working for the public. Confirmations aren\u2019t a bargaining chip, he said.\n\n\u2014Tom Lutey\n\nOn Background",

The system seeks to enhance national security measures while improving immigration efficiency by providing the Israeli Population & Immigration Authority with traveler data needed to pre-screen incoming visitors.\n\nSimilar to the United States\u2019 Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), which has been required for visa-exempt travelers since 2009, registration and approval in ETA-IL is now required for nearly all entrants to Israel at least 72 hours before arrival. Registrants must enter their passport information (from a visa-exempt country), valid email address, and a valid payment method to cover the required registration fee of 25 Israeli Shekel (about USD 7). Once the application is submitted, an \u201cimmediate\u201d response is emailed to \u201cmost applicants,\u201d with some requiring up to 72 hours to process.\n\nSince the Israeli Population & Immigration Authority may follow up with additional questions for some applicants, travelers should consider submitting the ETA-IL application well in advance. Once approved, the authorization remains valid for up to two years (or until passport expiration, whichever is sooner), permitting business or tourism entry for a maximum of 90 days per visit.

At the time, three companies got the largest number of visas in the H-1B lottery: Infosys, Tata and Cognizant. All three used a business model that cut costs by bringing over temporary workers from India and leasing them out to American firms like indentured servants. Prominent companies were jettisoning their locally hired I.T. departments and outsourcing those jobs.\n\nNot much has changed.

Specifically, last month\u2019s rule revises the definition of \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d to clarify that while sponsoring employers may accept a range of qualifying degree fields when considering candidates for such occupations, the fields must be directly related to a job\u2019s duties in order to meet the specialty occupation requirement.\n\nOther changes include updated definitions for the nonprofit and governmental research organization categories, through which DHS would expand visa cap exemption eligibility for some petitions in these categories. Another set of updates clarifies requirements for visa petitioners. The rule is set to take effect Jan. 17.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nEmployers should prepare for some potential disruption caused by the new rule, attorneys with law firm Fragomen said last month in a blog. The firm said the rule would require use of a new Form I-129 and that adjudicators for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u201cmay take some time to become familiar with the new legal standards.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of many immigration-related adjustments employers might need to make ahead over the next few months. The upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump has caused some employment law experts to warn of the potential for worksite investigations, as well as auditing of employers\u2019 Form I-9 compliance practices.\n\nIn a press release last month, DHS said its rule aimed to improve efficiency as well as flexibility in the H-1B program.\n\n\u201cThe H-1B program was created by Congress in 1990, and there\u2019s no question it needed to be modernized to support our nation\u2019s growing economy,\u201d Ur Jaddou, director of USCIS, said in the release. \u201cThe changes made in today\u2019s final rule will ensure that U.S. employers can hire the highly skilled workers they need to grow and innovate while enhancing the integrity of the program.\u201d\n\nThe 2023 H-1B proposed rule also contained provisions around preventing fraud that DHS addressed separately in a final rule published in January 2024. That rule amended the agency\u2019s process for selecting H-1B visa program registrants, implementing a \u201cbeneficiary centric\u201d process that selects petitions by unique beneficiary rather than by registration.",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\n\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar. Many of the firm\u2019s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\n\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Visa was not in compliance with federal antitrust laws; (2) Visa did not have effective internal programs and policies to assess and control compliance with federal antitrust laws; and (3) as a result, defendants\u2019 public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\n\nTo join the Visa class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=29131 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\n\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor\u2019s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\n\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm.\n\nAttorney Advertising.

            "content": "Days before President-elect Donald Trump's presidential inauguration on January 20, an open battle has erupted between two groups of Trump supporters - DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency) versus MAGA (Make America Great Again) - over the misuse of the H-1B visa programme by Indians.\n\nAs of now, Trump seems to be supporting the DOGE team under tech titans Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in the row over the visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US. However, Tesla CEO Musk admitted that the H-1B visa system was \"broken\" and that it needed \"major reform\".\n\nTrump chose to walk into the debate and reportedly said that he \"always liked\" H-1B visas and hired guest workers under the scheme - even though he has previously been critical of the programme. That has left his MAGA fan base in shock.\n\nWhy the resentment?\n\nThe discussion became intense after the nomination of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-origin venture capitalist, to lead AI policy in the Trump administration. Krishnan's views on social media in the past, advocating relaxation in green card restrictions for skilled workers, have enraged MAGA critics who accuse him of pushing an \"India First\" agenda.\n\nRight-wing influencer Laura Loomer criticised Krishnan's appointment and blamed Musk and Ramaswamy for neglecting American workers.\n\nThis has pitched Trump's advisors from the tech world, immigrants themselves, against native Republicans - the MAGA supporters. The MAGA group supported Trump in the hope that he will take strict action on all kinds of immigration. Trump is known to have opposed H-1B visas in the past.\n\n\"Trump openly coming out in support of the H1B visa programme means that he is antagonising the hard-line anti-immigration supporters in the MAGA coalition,\" says Uma Purushothaman, Associate Professor, US Studies, School of International Studies, JNU.\n\n\"But given the strength of his victory this time and his close ties to techno oligarchs like Elon Musk, it is a constituency he might be willing to sideline for the time being,\" she adds.\n\nIt is clear to the world that both Musk and Ramaswamy believe that America's tech industry relies heavily on engineers and professionals from countries like India.\n\n\"If you want your team to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be,\" Musk posted on X, pointing to a \"permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent\" in Silicon Valley.\n\n'America beckons, but Americans repel'\n\nThe chasm between the old timers in the Trump camp, mostly far-right nativists, and the newcomers who came to America late as immigrants but are Trump supporters like Musk and Ramaswamy, is now out in the open.\n\nNikki Haley, Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations and a former Republican presidential candidate, is another major voice arguing against Ramaswamy and Musk.\n\nHaley, like Ramaswamy, was born to Indian immigrants, but joined the camp opposing the visa programme led by right-wing MAGA supporters.\n\nTrump faces nothing short of a tightrope act as he prepares for his second presidency.\n\n\"As a businessman, Trump knows the advantages of these programmes. Trump's stance means that his focus is going to be more on illegal immigration than shutting down visa programmes. He would possibly try to reform these programmes, though, as Musk has said,\" says Purushothaman.\n\n'America beckons, but Americans repel' is an old immigrant proverb born in the nineteenth century. Yet it holds true even today as native-born Republicans, some only a generation or two or more themselves, voice their resentment for new immigrants like Musk, Ramaswamy and Krishnan and their ilk.\n\nThe 'fear of competition' ingrained in 'nativists' fails to consider America's lack of skilled manpower requirements. In the old days, America required immigrant labourers to work in its factories. Similarly, the country now requires qualified immigrant engineers to power the country's technology sector.\n\nRecent research by Boundless, an immigration consultancy, points out that about 73% of the H-1B visas were issued to Indians compared to only 12% to Chinese. It shows the skills, talent and academic qualifications of Indian nationals are increasingly required over the years to shape America's primacy.\n\nThough Indians form merely 1.5% of the US population, they occupy high profile posts such as doctors, CEOs, scientists and even astronauts, and have the highest median income compared to other immigrants.\n\nEven feeling threatened by DOGE or for that matter Sriram seems to be far-fetched now. They are merely advisors who will probably help make policies. They won't be running the government; they are not part of the Trump administration.\n\nIndians living illegally in the US is an issue that must be tackled by the Trump administration. The Indian government must take up the recent hate-mongering against Indians by MAGA supporters with the US government. At the same time, India needs to take steps to stop all illegal migration via 'dunki' routes. Only then will we have the high moral ground.",

            "content": "Happy New Year, folks! In today\u2019s Finshots, we break down the H-1B visa debate and how it affects both the US and Indian economies.\n\nBut before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You\u2019re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story!\n\nThe Story\n\nIn 1990 , President George Herbert Walker Bush signed the \u201cImmigration Act of 1990\u201d and introduced the H-1B visa programme. The idea was simple \u2014 help American companies fill vacancies in specialised fields like research, engineering and computer programming by temporarily hiring skilled foreign workers.\n\nBut over time, the programme became a hotbed of controversy. Just think about it. If foreign workers started taking up jobs in your country, wouldn\u2019t it feel like your chances of landing one were shrinking? That\u2019s exactly how many Americans started to feel too.\n\nAnd this unease has fuelled endless debates about whether H-1B visas help or hurt, even sparking divisions within President-to-be Donald Trump\u2019s team.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term as President, he wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of the programme. He thought it was unfair to American workers and introduced restrictions in 2020, arguing that it allowed employers to replace locals with cheaper foreign labour.\n\nBut fast forward to now, and things seem to be shifting.\n\nTrump\u2019s new allies like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who\u2019ve been tasked with leading the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are rooting for reforms to strengthen the H-1B system. And now, Indian-American Sriram Krishnan\u2019s appointment to Trump\u2019s team as a senior AI policy advisor has sparked talks about removing country-specific caps on employment visas. This could let more H-1B holders live and work permanently in the US, which could be a game-changer.\n\nTo put things in perspective, every year, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) hands out 65,000 H-1B visas, with an extra 20,000 reserved for those with master\u2019s or doctorate degrees from US institutions. But here\u2019s the catch. There are way more people applying than the number of spots available. So, the system turns into a lottery. And many eligible applicants miss out purely because of bad luck.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where things get even trickier.\n\nYou see, Indians make up over 70% of the H-1B visa recipients, while China takes around 12-13% . The rest go to countries like Mexico, Canada, the Philippines, Taiwan and Korea. But these visas are valid for only 3 years and can be extended to a maximum of 6 years. And if visa holders want to stay longer, they\u2019ll need to apply for a Green Card or Permanent Resident Card, which allows them to live and work in the US permanently. The catch though is that there\u2019s a cap on how many Green Cards each country can receive. No more than 7% of the total can go to workers from a single country, even if there\u2019s an overwhelming talent pool waiting. So, if those country-specific caps were removed, it could open up more opportunities for Indians looking to work in the US.\n\nBut you can imagine that not everyone in America shares that optimism. Some Trump loyalists like Steve Bannon (former White House Chief Strategist), Nikki Haley (former Governor of South Carolina) and Laura Loomer (political activist) argue that foreign workers are taking jobs from Americans. And they\u2019re not alone. Recent surveys show that 60% of Americans believe the country already has enough skilled workers to fill these roles and doesn\u2019t need more.\n\nBut do their worries actually make sense, you ask?\n\nWell, if you look at it from the lens of tech companies, their argument may be valid. After all, some of the biggest employers of foreign workers in the US come from the tech world, including global giants and four Indian tech majors like Infosys, TCS, HCL and Wipro. Together, these companies account for about 35% of the top 10 H-1B visa beneficiaries.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why, well, hiring Indian employees is often cheaper for these companies. Many Indian workers are willing to accept lower pay than their American counterparts, allowing companies to save on wages while still offering a pay raise that looks impressive by Indian standards.\n\nFor context, in 2023, almost 70% of the H-1B petitions approved for Indian professionals were for salaries under $100,000 per year, even though the average IT salary in the US was around $104,000. This means that Americans might have had to lower their pay expectations to compete for these jobs. And that has led some to argue that foreign workers are driving down wages for domestic employees.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist. Immigrants on H-1B visas might actually be benefitting Americans more than people think. Yup. Because think of it this way. Immigrants and native-born Americans don\u2019t always have the same skill set, which means they\u2019re not always competing for the same roles. Instead, they\u2019re collaborating, filling in the gaps where needed.\n\nWhen immigrants spend their earnings in the US, it creates a ripple effect. More demand for goods and services means companies grow, rather than moving operations overseas. Plus, immigrants often start their own businesses, adding even more jobs to the US economy. Not just that. They bring fresh ideas and innovation that fuel economic growth and create more opportunities.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just us saying this. The numbers back this up. A study by the American Immigration Council found that from 2004 to 2023, and even during the pandemic, fields like science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) consistently had low unemployment rates. So, the demand for skilled workers was actually more than the supply.\n\nSource: American Immigration Council\n\nMoreover, it suggests that H-1B workers don\u2019t really earn low wages or drag down the wages of their domestic counterparts. In fact, the average wage for an H-1B worker was $108,000 in 2021, compared to $45,800 for US workers in general. And between 2003 and 2021, the median wage of H-1B workers grew by 50%, while the average wage of US workers rose by 40%. So it\u2019s like employers who hired H-1B workers often offered them wages above the Department of Labor\u2019s \u201cprevailing wage\u201d for similar jobs.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that between 2010 and 2019, US companies like Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer, who later helped develop COVID-19 vaccines, hired over 3,300 scientists, including biochemists and chemists, through the H-1B programme. Many of the doctors on the front lines during the pandemic were also H-1B visa holders. So, maybe that\u2019s the bigger picture Americans haven\u2019t fully considered yet.\n\nOn the flip side though, here\u2019s something for Indians to think about. If the US clamps down on H-1B visas, the flow of skilled Indian professionals might shift back to India . And India might just be ready for it. With improved infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and a booming ecosystem for global capability centres (GCCs) in fields like AI and robotics, the country could absorb this returning talent. But even if H-1B aspirants are concerned about their quality of life in India, other countries, especially in Europe, might swoop in and grab that talent instead.\n\nSo yeah, no matter where the H-1B visa debate goes, it\u2019s not going to drastically change things for most Indians. We\u2019ll only have to wait and see how the Trump administration navigates this.\n\nUntil then\u2026\n\nNote: An earlier version of this story wrongly mentioned that there\u2019s a country-specific cap on H-1B visas. The 7% cap actually applies to Green Cards, not H-1B visas. We\u2019ve now fixed this and regret the error.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to share this story on WhatsApp, LinkedIn and X.\n\n\ud83d\udce2Finshots has a new WhatsApp Channel!\n\nIf you want the sharpest analysis of all financial news without the jargon, Finshots is the place to be!

Read our privacy policy\n\nThe H-1B visa is at the center of a feud that has engulfed supporters of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nWhile many on the far-right, such as activist Laura Loomer and former Trump adviser Steven Bannon, are fiercely anti-immigrant, Silicon Valley tech figures, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, have come out in support of the visas, which are for highly skilled immigrants typically working in tech, healthcare, engineering and finance.\n\nTrump has supported Musk and Ramaswamy, who want better legal immigration routes such as the H-1B program to fill skills gaps in key sectors such as engineering, science, and technology.\n\nThe president-elect told the New York Post that he has \u201calways been in favor of the visas,\u201d but previously said they are \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers.\n\nWhat are H-1B visas?\n\nopen image in gallery Trump was vehemently against the H-1B visa during his first administration ( Getty Images )\n\nThe popular visa, created in 1990, allows U.S. employers to temporarily offer work to foreign nationals who have \u201ctheoretical and practical application\u201d of highly specialized knowledge. Applicants must have a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree in a specific specialty subject, or equivalent, as a minimum to enter the U.S., according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nTypically, the visa is valid for three years with the possibility of extending for a maximum of six years. The visa can cost employers approximately $5,000 per applicant.\n\nIt does not automatically grant permanent residency.\n\nThe visas are highly sought after in healthcare, engineering, tech, finance and higher education. A company will employ an H-1B worker on the basis that the specialty cannot be filled by the U.S. workforce.\n\nThe majority of H-1B visa applicants come from India, whose citizens account for more than seven in 10 recipients, according to a USCIS report. One in 10 comes from China, with the remainder coming from other nations including Mexico, Canada, the Philippines, Taiwan and Korea.\n\nAre they difficult to obtain?\n\nEach year, 65,000 H-1B visas are approved by the Department of Homeland Security, with an additional 20,000 available for applicants who graduate with a master\u2019s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution.\n\nApplicants are chosen by a lottery system for review, which means that some are denied due to chance even if they are eligible.\n\nThe application process can generally take between two to eight months, according to a number of immigration law firms. Premium processing is available for a fee, which can reduce the wait time.\n\nWhat has Trump previously said about H-1B visas?\n\nopen image in gallery Trump has backed his ally Elon Musk on the H-1B visa ( AP )\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first administration, the H-1B visa program was restricted in 2020 over concerns it allowed employers to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign workers.\n\nNow, he appears to have backtracked on that sentiment after coming out in support of Musk and Ramaswamy, who will lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency. Ramaswamy argued that America does \u201cnot produce the best engineers,\u201d while Musk said that there is \u201ca permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent\u201d in the U.S.\n\nSpeaking by phone with The New York Post on Saturday, the president-elect agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That\u2019s why we have them,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a 2016 primary debate, however, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I think and I know the H-1B very well. And it\u2019s something that I frankly use and I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use it. We shouldn\u2019t have it,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond of all, I think it\u2019s very important to say, well, I\u2019m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\u201d\n\nThree months after taking office in 2020, Trump issued his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest reforms to ensure that H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn June 2022, in conflict with the president-elect\u2019s previous views on the visa, Trump Media & Technology Group which owns Truth Social, filed an application for an H-1B visa for an employee with a $65,000 salary, according to AP. The company said it did not hire the worker and the application \u201cwas made under prior management.\u201d",

This has led Musk and Ramaswamy to clash heads with other Trump allies like Laura Loomer and Steve Bannon who say that the H1-B program should be done away with, claiming that the program keeps jobs away from American workers.\n\nH-1B applicants must have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree or equivalent experience in the occupation they wish to fill in order to receive a visa through the program. Once attained, an H1-B visa can last up to six years. Around 85,000 H1-B visas are issued each year, the majority going to first-time applicants while around 20,000 go to current visa holders who are graduating with a master\u2019s degree or doctorate from a U.S. college or university.\n\nWhether Trump himself will actually pursue restrictions on the H1-B program is unclear. Although the president-elect has been critical of the program in the past and restricted foreign worker visas during his first term during the COVID-19 pandemic, he also publicly voiced support for the program in a recent interview with The New York Post",

H-1B Registration Fee\n\nAmount: $10\n\nDetails: To participate in the H-1B lottery, applicants must first register electronically with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The registration fee remains at $10, a fee that has been in place since March 2024. This fee is required during the initial registration period, which typically occurs in March each year.\n\n2. USCIS Filing Fees\n\nBase Filing Fee: $460\n\nAnti-Fraud Fee: $500\n\nDetails: The base filing fee of $460 applies to all H-1B petitions. The anti-fraud fee of $500 is mandatory for all initial and change of employer petitions. This additional fee is meant to prevent fraud and misuse of the H-1B program.\n\n\n\n3. Additional Fees for Certain Employers\n\nAmount: $4,000\n\nDetails: Employers with more than 50 employees, where more than 50% of the workforce is on H-1B or L-1 visas, are required to pay an additional $4,000 fee. This fee is part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2025. Employers filing petitions under this category will need to account for the increased cost.\n\n4. Premium Processing Fee (Optional)\n\nAmount: $2,805\n\nDetails: Premium processing is an optional service that allows employers to expedite the processing of their H-1B petitions to just 15 calendar days. The fee for premium processing increased in 2024 to $2,805. This service is typically used by employers who need quicker results for critical positions.\n\nTotal Estimated Costs\n\nFor Employers Not Subject to the Additional $4,000 Fee: $10 (Registration Fee) + $460 (Base Filing Fee) + $500 (Anti-Fraud Fee) = $970\n\nFor Employers Subject to the Additional $4,000 Fee: $10 (Registration Fee) + $460 (Base Filing Fee) + $500 (Anti-Fraud Fee) + $4,000 (Additional Employer Fee) = $4,970\n\nWith Premium Processing: Add $2,805 for expedited processing, bringing the total for employers opting for premium processing to $3,775 or $7,775, depending on employer status.\n\n\n\nWho pays for the H-1B visa?\n\nLive Events\n\nEmployer Pays\n\nBase Filing Fee ($460): The employer is required to pay this fee when filing the H-1B petition with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Anti-Fraud Fee ($500): This fee is mandatory for initial and change-of-employer petitions. It is also the employer\u2019s responsibility to cover this cost. Additional Employer Fee ($4,000): Employers with more than 50 employees, where more than 50% of the workforce is on H-1B or L-1 visas, must pay this additional fee. It\u2019s part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016.

The purpose of this rule is to prevent situations where the employee\u2019s wages could be reduced as a result of these costs.\n\nAs the 2025 fiscal year approaches, prospective H-1B visa applicants should be aware of the costs involved in applying for this highly sought-after work visa. The H-1B program, which allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, comes with several fees that can vary depending on the type of petition being filed and the employer's status.Here\u2019s a breakdown of the costs associated with obtaining an H-1B visa in 2025:The total cost of applying for an H-1B visa depends on the employer\u2019s circumstances.

For physicians and other high-income professionals on work visas like J1, H1-B, or similar, an unexpected injury or illness could disrupt both their finances and their ability to remain in the United States.\n\nA Foreign Medical Graduate\u2019s Journey\n\nConsider the story of a foreign medical graduate shared in The White Coat Investor Forum. This family\u2014a physician and a software engineer with two young children\u2014worked hard to achieve their professional and personal goals. After years of dedication and sacrifice, the physician finally secured a coveted residency position in internal medicine.\n\nTheir journey was far from easy. The family spent nearly all their savings on the process of obtaining a residency position. This included expensive USMLE exams, unpaid observerships in programs across the country, and applications to more than 200 residency programs. Each step brought financial and logistical challenges, requiring the couple to juggle parenting responsibilities, relocation costs, and the uncertainty of whether their efforts would pay off.\n\nWhen the residency position was finally secured, it was a major victory. However, it also came with the realization that their financial security now depended heavily on the physician\u2019s ability to continue working. As immigrants, they had built their lives and their future around this income. Any disruption to their earnings due to illness or injury could have devastating consequences. This is why income protection, regardless of citizenship status, should be one of the first things purchased as a foreign national physician.\n\nBut there are also things to consider.\n\nDisability insurance plays a crucial role in securing financial stability for foreign nationals. Statistics show a physician has a 1 in 7 chance of experiencing a disability during working years that could prevent them from earning an income for a period of time. In addition, 90% of all long-term disability claims are due to illnesses and 10% are due to injury. While securing disability insurance is essential, foreign nationals face unique challenges and considerations when navigating their options.\n\nKey Challenges for Foreign Nationals\n\nDisability insurance policies for foreign nationals often come with specific restrictions due to concerns about:\n\nResidency status: Policies may require applicants to have permanent residency or meet specific visa requirements.\n\nPolicies may require applicants to have permanent residency or meet specific visa requirements. Foreign travel: Many insurers impose limitations on benefits if the insured spends extended time outside the US.\n\nMany insurers impose limitations on benefits if the insured spends extended time outside the US. Claims administration: Managing claims internationally can pose logistical challenges for insurers.\n\nInsurers generally address these risks in a few ways:\n\nLimiting benefit periods to a specific duration (typically up to 12 months while outside the US). Requiring the insured to live in the US for a certain period annually to maintain full benefits\u2014sometimes at least six months every year if a claim is ever made. Adding exclusion riders to policies issued to visa holders, restricting claims for incidents occurring abroad.\n\nMore information here:\n\nGo Buy Disability Insurance!\n\nWhy Do Some Doctors Get Declined for Disability Insurance?\n\nHow the \u201cBig 5\u201d Disability Insurers Handle Disability Insurance for Foreign Nationals\n\nPrincipal\n\nPrincipal offers disability coverage to foreign nationals with the following considerations:\n\nGreen card holders: Treated the same as US citizens after residing in the US for at least one year.\n\nTreated the same as US citizens after residing in the US for at least one year.

Once a green card is obtained, insurers are often willing to remove exclusion riders, leaving you with a more comprehensive policy.\n\nNo Green Card\n\nShop around by checking with one of the WCI-vetted insurance agents to get a quote and see what\u2019s available. They\u2019ll know what the best option would be in your situation. Focus on policies that provide some benefits even with limitations. If possible, try to find policies without exclusions for foreign travel, as they may leave you unprotected in the event of a disability.\n\nThe Value of Professional Guidance\n\nDisability insurance for foreign nationals can be challenging, but you don\u2019t have to navigate it alone.

We need competent people. We need smart people coming into our country. We need a lot of people coming in. We're going to have jobs like we've never had before,\" Mr Trump told a reporter at his New Year's Eve party.\n\nBREAKING: Donald Trump aligns with Elon Musk in support of H1B Visa.\n\n\n\n\"We have to have the most competent people in our country. We need smart people coming into our country and we need a lot of people coming in.\" pic.twitter.com/Cv3amxJjT0 \u2014 DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) January 1, 2025\n\nDonald Trump has picked Elon Musk, along with Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, to lead his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nAbout H-1B Visa Programme\n\nThe H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa which allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Tech companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China, and therefore, the sector has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the US.\n\nBut, Donald Trump's first administration restricted the programme in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers. With Mr Trump set to serve a second term in the White House, several of the Republican leader's supporters and immigration hardliners have been increasingly pushing for scrapping the programme.\n\nHowever, Mr Musk, who was once on an H-1B visa himself, and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the programme, defended the tech industry's need to hire foreign workers. He had been consistently posting on X in favour of the programme.\n\n\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Mr Musk wrote on December 25 on X.\n\nDebate Over H-1B Visa\n\nHowever, a debate sparked when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer, criticised Mr Trump's selection of Indian-American entrepreneur Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Mr Krishnan favours the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the US.\n\nMs Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Mr Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.\n\nThe debate intensified when Mr Ramaswamy criticised American culture for promoting mediocrity instead of focusing on academic excellence and success based on merit. \"Trump's election hopefully marks the beginning of a new golden era in America, but only if our culture fully wakes up. A culture that once again prioritises achievement over normalcy; excellence over mediocrity; nerdiness over conformity; hard work over laziness,\" Mr Ramaswamy said on Thursday.\n\nHe faced backlash for the comment. In response, Mr Musk called for removing \"contemptible fools\" from the Republican Party who oppose his immigration agenda.\n\n\"The reason I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B,\" Mr Musk wrote on X.",

            "content": "Of all the rich and powerful people cozying up to President-elect Donald Trump, few have rushed to Mar-a-Lago faster than the crowned heads of big tech, including California\u2019s own chiefs of Google and Meta.\n\nAnd few have a stronger motive to curry Trump\u2019s favor than Silicon Valley: The fate of the H-1B visa program that permits foreign-born computer scientists, engineers and other highly skilled workers to migrate to the United States hangs in the balance.\n\nSupport for retaining H-1B from Elon Musk, the incoming president\u2019s new closest associate, has stirred rage through much of Trump\u2019s MAGA base, which is against immigration in almost any form. But keeping the pipeline open for tech and other skilled workers is seen by many business leaders as crucial for the U.S. economy, especially in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state is by far the biggest user of the H-1B. More than 9,600 employers in California sought clearance for at least one H-1B worker in fiscal 2024, with 78,860 visa applications for new and continuing employment being approved, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nThey include all kinds of skilled workers in various industries, including nurses and science teachers. But the top 10 beneficiaries of H-1B visas in California \u2014 accounting for almost one-third of all the approvals \u2014 were dominated by tech giants, most of them in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\u201cThose companies are the ones that can afford to hire outside firms that navigate the paperwork, the bureaucracy, and can jump through the hoops,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, who leads technology policy at the Chamber of Progress, a group backed by big tech firms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe number of H-1B visas for new employment is capped at 65,000 a year nationally. An additional 20,000 are set aside for foreign nationals who have earned a master\u2019s degree or higher in the U.S. H-1B visas are good for three years but can be extended for up to another three years.\n\nTech companies in California and elsewhere have relied on the program even as they made massive job cuts after the pandemic, during which many went overboard on hiring and other spending.\n\nThe fact that tech companies have fired thousands of American workers while hiring large numbers of foreign workers has added to the fury of anti-immigration Trump supporters, who have long argued immigrants take jobs away from Americans by working for less pay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question of whether that claim is valid does not have an easy or simple answer.\n\nU.S. graduate school students in engineering and the sciences are disproportionately foreign-born, and even with that there are shortages of some highly skilled workers, particularly in high-tech engineering and emerging areas such as artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia, the major Santa Clara supplier of AI hardware and software, got H-1B visa approvals for more than 1,500 workers last year in California, according to USCIS data. The company declined to comment, and other top tech users of the H-1B, including Google, Meta and Apple, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cIf you lay off a programmer, it\u2019s not the same skill set as somebody who has a post-doctorate in AI, so you have to look at the skills that are sought and why,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jos\u00e9), who sits on the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.\n\nBut she said the H-1B isn\u2019t without its challenges, pointing to cases in the past at UC San Francisco and Southern California Edison in which U.S. workers were reported displaced by lower-paid H-1B visa holders.\n\nEmployers who hire H-1B workers are required to pay wages at least as much as for similar U.S. professionals, but there are abuses. Lofgren said systemic improvements are needed, including stronger analysis on skill sets for the jobs available and more robust advertising on openings.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, workers from India dominate H-1B visas, in part because there are country quotas for permanent immigration, and temporary work visas are seen as a bridge to that, although the wait is often many years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople say the immigration system is broken, and this is part of the brokenness,\u201d Lofgren said, adding that especially for California, \u201cour economy is dependent on, and our prosperity is tied to, immigrants.\u201d\n\nThe acrimony over the H-1B in recent days spiraled after far-right activist Laura Loomer attacked H-1B as a threat to American workers and national security.\n\nShe and other critics of worker visas say they lead to fewer jobs for U.S. workers, but academic research over the years has found little evidence to support that claim overall. And although some laid-off workers have been forced to retire or switch careers, studies have found many also have been re-employed relatively quickly.\n\nFor computer and mathematical occupations, the November unemployment rate was just 2.5%, up from 1.7% a year ago; and it was unchanged at 2% for architectural and engineering occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nLoomer suggested a major clash ahead between immigration hardliners such as Stephen Miller, named as Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy, and those including Vivek Ramaswamy, the former Republican presidential candidate who with Musk has been charged by Trump to cut government spending and regulation.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest person who runs Tesla and SpaceX and is himself an immigrant and onetime H-1B visa holder, has come out championing the hiring of skilled foreign workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe visa program has certainly helped Tesla, which this fiscal year received H-1B approvals for 1,765 new and continuing workers, although SpaceX has grown with little benefit of H-1B workers. (Musk moved Tesla\u2019s headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Palo Alto at the end of 2021, and said this year that he was relocating SpaceX to Texas as well.)\n\n\u201cOF COURSE my companies and I would prefer to hire Americans and we DO, as that is MUCH easier than going through the incredibly painful and slow work visa process,\u201d Musk wrote Christmas Day on his social media platform, X. \u201cHowever, there is dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America. It comes down to this: do you want America to WIN or do you want America to LOSE. If you force the world\u2019s best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\u201d\n\nTrump on Saturday seemed to side with Musk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times,\u201d he told the New York Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a great program.\u201d\n\n(Trump\u2019s businesses have used predominantly the H-2B program, which are for temporary seasonal workers that hotels and tourist businesses, for example, make heavy use of during summer. H-2A is for temporary farmworkers.)\n\nDespite his record and promises to seal the borders and deport millions of undocumented immigrants, Trump\u2019s remarks raised hopes among some immigration advocates that the incoming president could take a softer tack on H-1B visas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his first term, Trump\u2019s team made it a lot tougher for employers to get H-1B approvals, and denial rates jumped above 20% in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, triple the average of the prior administration, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a Washington think tank that favors higher levels of immigration.\n\n\u201cAt minimum it muddies the waters,\u201d said Stuart Anderson, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt could signal a neutral policy rather than a hostile one.\u201d\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration expert at Cornell Law School, said that despite the deficiencies in H-1B, he believes that \u201cmost employers try to follow the rules. At the macro-level, H-1B workers are helping our economy and creating more jobs for U.S. workers.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs, in particular, have talked about skilled worker visas as being crucial for their growth.\n\nYale-Loehr also noted that recent changes have given U.S. immigration officials greater authority to tighten up the H-1B program, including imposing penalties and inspections.\n\nThat could strengthen enforcement and cut down on abuses, if Trump follows through on his supportive remarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to see. You\u2019ve got some people in the administration like Elon Musk who want to preserve the H-1B category and other people like Stephen Miller who want to restrict all immigration, including H-1B,\u201d Yale-Loehr said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see which side wins over the four years of the Trump administration.\u201d",

The exact timing of when it goes into effect, though, is up in the air.\n\nOnce in effect, Americans will need one additional approval to enter countries in the European Union. To visit, you'll have to apply for approval under the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) . You will apply online, and the authorization, which will be linked to your passport, will account for short-term stays, including up to 90 days in a 180-day period.\n\nThis had been planned to be in effect in 2024, but in 2023, the European Union indicated it won't happen till 2025. In order for ETIAS to be operable, another new European Union program, Entry/Exit System, or EES, has to go into effect. The European Union has indicated EES will go into effect in 2025, and ETIAS will start six months after EES starts.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

The application will ask for information like your name, address, passport information, current occupation, as well as information about past travel to conflict zones and criminal convictions.\n\nYou will also have to share information about your travel plans. The application will not require any health information or biometric data, like fingerprints.\n\nThe ETIAS website says \"most\" applications are processed in minutes, but approval time could extend up to four days. Additionally, some requestors may be asked for more information or to do an interview, which would extend the process by up to 14 days for more documentation, or 30 days for an interview. So if you're planning travel, remember to apply at least a month before you have to go.\n\nThe good news is that once you're approved, the authorization lasts for three years. But if your passport expires within those three years, you'll need to apply again.\n\nEmail is important to this process. You apply online, and then receive an email confirming your application. That email \"will include your unique ETIAS application number: make sure you keep this number for future reference,\" the ETIAS website says. You will get another email once your application is processed.\n\nIf your application gets rejected, the email will have the reasons for it. You will have the option to appeal a rejection.\n\nWho needs to apply for ETIAS, and for traveling to which countries?\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nIf you are an American citizen planning to travel to countries in the Schengen area, and Cyprus, you will need to apply for ETIAS authorization. (The \"Schengen area\" refers to a border agreement between countries in Europe.)\n\nThere are 30 countries on that list, which includes: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nThat does mean that if you're an American traveling to the United Kingdom or Ireland, you will not need ETIAS authorization.\n\nIt should also be noted that while ETIAS applies for traveling in the Schengen area, it is different from a Schengen visa. A Schengen visa is required for citizens of other non-EU countries, not including the United States, visiting the region. You can find more information about Schengen visas here .\n\nHow much ETIAS costs\n\nIn addition to adding some hassle, this requirement will make a family vacation slightly more expensive. Applications will cost 7 euros, which right now is close to $7.25. However, applications for people under 18 or over 70 years old are free. There are also some exemptions for those who have EU citizen family members and \"non-EU nationals who have the right to move freely throughout the European Union.\"\n\nOne more thing to look out for: ETIAS warned last spring that many unofficial ETIAS websites have sprung up. ETIAS says these sites have incorrect information and some \"already collect travelers' personal data, which is concerning.\" Protect your identity and avoid scams by only using the official ETIAS website.\n\nHow ETIAS changes travel\n\nOnce ETIAS is launched, it will obviously impact some of the details of travel logistics.\n\nIf you are getting to Europe via air or sea, i.e. flying or taking a cruise, for example, the carrier you use will be required to verify you have a valid ETIAS travel authorizations within 48 hours before departure. ETIAS says they will verify authorizations via a new tool. If you do not have a valid ETIAS authorization, you will not be allowed to board your plane, bus or sea vessel.\n\nHowever, if you are traveling into the area via train, train operators will not check for ETIAS authorization. But, ETIAS will still be checked at the border, and the system specifies that people traveling from the U.K. by, for example, the Eurostar train will be checked by a border guard before boarding.\n\nWhat ETIAS means for students, residents and families\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nIf your child or grandchild is planning to study abroad in Europe, you should know there's a distinction between ETIAS and a student visa. ETIAS allows a person to study in Europe for up to 90 days. But if they're planning to stay longer, like a full semester, they will need a student visa.\n\nIf they finish their semester and want to stick around and travel a little longer, they \"can remain in the European countries requiring ETIAS for up to an additional 90 days without needing to leave and return,\" the program says. But they will need a valid ETIAS travel authorization and to be registered in the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will usually happen at the border. Remember, EES hasn't started yet either, but is expected to start in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, if you have a residence permit or card from a European country that otherwise requires ETIAS, you do not need to apply for ETIAS travel authorization. This is also true if you are a national of a European country that otherwise requires ETIAS.\n\nAs previously mentioned, if you are a family member of a European national, you do not have to pay the ETIAS application fee. But there are strict specifications around who qualifies as a \"family member.\" Family members as defined by ETIAS include spouses, registered partners, direct descendants under age 21, and dependent direct relatives. Make sure to read the rules carefully and don't assume your situation means you don't need to apply.\n\nThe bottom line on what you need to travel to Europe\n\nThis will be a big change for Americans since there hasn't been a visa requirement to visit EU countries before. Keep this in mind before your big trip to Greece, Italy, France or any of the other 30 Euro nations in 2025. Also, consider shopping around for travel prices using sites like Skyscanner ahead of time to find the best deals.\n\nMeanwhile, Cameron Hewitt, content and editorial director at Rick Steves' Europe, told the Washington Post : \"It certainly shouldn\u2019t cause anyone to rethink a trip to Europe. From what we know, ETIAS looks like it\u2019ll simply be a manageable bit of red tape.\" Then, your biggest concern will be avoiding the crowds on Santorini .\n\nFor now, though, the old rules are in place, and you do not need a visa to travel to Europe for trips under 90 days as an American \u2014 yet. But you should check your passport's expiration date, as it needs to be valid for at least six months after arrival in the European Schengen area, and be aware of how long it takes to renew your passport .",

The visas last three years, or up to six years with an extension. These visa holders can potentially go on to apply for a green card.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Because less than half of graduates from U.S. universities in advanced STEM degree fields are U.S. citizens, the H-1B program tends to have the highest usage in technology, science and quantitative occupations,\" said Sarah Peterson, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and partner at Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy, LLP. \"However, the H-1B program is also a vital hiring tool for U.S. universities and health care systems that struggle to hire enough workers to fill highly specialized positions.\"\n\nThe conversation around H-1B visas \u2014 and whether to restrict or enhance the program \u2014 comes as conservative figures criticize President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk for their apparent support of H-1B visas amid Trump\u2019s campaign promises to carry out mass deportations. Trump, in 2016, did call the visas \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\nMayo Clinic ranks third among Minnesota organizations for the number of H-1B visa approvals it has received, with 390 in fiscal year 2024. Out of Minnesota's 4,518 H-1B visas receiving initial or continuing approval that fiscal year, the biggest share, 471, is associated with U.S. Bank, with Optum coming in second with 419.\n\nIn Rochester, Mayo Clinic is by far the largest H-1B sponsor. Over the past few years, other employers, including Olmsted Medical Center, Crenlo Engineered Cabs, Rochester Math and Science Academy, and Vyriad have petitioned for just a handful of H-1B visas, per the USCIS database.\n\nBeing approved for a H-1B visa to fill a job doesn\u2019t always mean that the visa is actually used. Trbhi, a Rochester technology firm with an international customer base, did apply for and was approved for one H-1B visa in both 2022 and 2024. Despite paying around $4,000 in fees to petition for each visa, the company opted to not use it to fill the needed job in either year.\n\n\"We were working on complex projects where the need for specific talent was a priority. As we went through the recruitment process, we were not finding the exact talent match, which drove us to look for options,\" said Trbhi CEO Mani Thavasi. \"We did not end up using the approved H-1B visa; instead we hired in the U.S. as the project timelines were delayed.\"\n\nThe number of newly approved H-1B visa applications each year has increased at Mayo Clinic. In FY 2019, Mayo Clinic received 144 initial approvals for H-1B visas, compared to 231 in FY 2024.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe positions that Mayo Clinic applies to fill through the H-1B pathway mostly involve physicians and research professionals, according to information from labor condition applications (precursory paperwork for the H-1B visa application) compiled by H1B Grader. Job roles include research associate, research fellow, data science analyst, nurse practitioner, clinical resident, medical technologist, chaplain and anesthesiologist. The reported base salaries for these potential H-1B visa holders range between $47,652 and $1.2 million, with a median salary of $75,357.\n\nWhile most of these H-1B job roles are based in Rochester, some are located at Mayo Clinic's Florida and Arizona campuses, as well as in Mankato, Austin, Red Wing and other Mayo Clinic Health System sites.\n\nSix percent of H-1B visas in the U.S. are used by physicians, said Peterson, whose career has focused on representing these international doctors. The U.S. is facing a shortage of doctors, \"particularly in underserved rural and urban areas.\" Incoming international physicians must complete residency and fellowship training in the U.S. in order to practice medicine here, even if they have full credentials in their home country, Peterson said.\n\n\"To train in the U.S., most programs require international physicians to train under the J-1 program, which has a requirement to return home for two years after completing this required U.S. training,\" Peterson said. \"To stay in the U.S., these physicians ordinarily commit to working in medically underserved rural and urban areas after their training programs for at least three years. Most stay in their communities longer than their U.S. counterparts, and thus become part of the fabric of these underserved communities that face longer wait times for critical care services.\"\n\nBecause of the required additional training, \"this often means that international physicians are some of the most accomplished and highly trained physicians in the U.S.,\" Peterson said.\n\nPeterson said there are protections in place with the H-1B process to protect both the foreign workers and U.S. employees.\n\n\"For example, U.S. employers must pay an H-1B worker a salary that is at least at or above the market rate and at least what they pay other U.S. workers, which ensures H-1B workers are not depressing wages paid to U.S. workers,\" Peterson said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is unclear if the incoming presidential administration will come with changes to the H-1B visa program. In Trump's first term, his administration added new restrictions to the H-1B process, as reported by CBS News. But, one week ago, Musk \u2014 who said he once had an H-1B visa \u2014 emphasized the need for U.S. tech companies to bring in more engineers.\n\nTrump then spoke to the New York Post on Dec. 28, saying, \"I\u2019ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times.\"\n\nOne change, from President Joe Biden's administration, is already in the pipeline. A final rule from the Department of Homeland Security affecting the H-1B program will go into effect on Jan. 17, 2025, with the intent of \u201cstreamlining the approvals process, increasing its flexibility to better allow employers to retain talented workers, and improving the integrity and oversight of the program.\u201d\n\nThe Post Bulletin reached out to Mayo Clinic with questions about its H-1B workforce and foreign worker recruitment process, but did not receive a response before deadline.\n\nReporter Jeff Kiger contributed to this report.",

            "content": "What we know about US visas Trump supporters are clashing over\n\n31 December 2024 Share Save Jake Horton & Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, Washington DC Share Save\n\nReuters\n\nAn immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme. The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries. Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world. The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\". Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.\n\nHow many people are approved each year?\n\nThe H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years. Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities. However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued. People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution. The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country. Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures. That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas. The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.\n\nWhat happened under Trump?\n\nThere have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past. In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme. Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden. However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first. In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants. In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.\n\nDemand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved. In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system. \"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls. \"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\" We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply. The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023. With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency. \"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says. \"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"\n\nWhat industries and companies do they work in?\n\nThe vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year. This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors. In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme. Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively. Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa. California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.\n\nGetty Images Musk has spent hundreds of millions of dollars backing Trump and other Republicans\n\nHow much do they earn?\n\nThe median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000). The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme. The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year. While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion. The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country. Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce. \"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS. \"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\" Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees. \"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says. \"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"\n\nWhere are people coming from?\n\nThe vast majority of those approved come from India. The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens. About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s siding with Elon Musk over visas for high-tech workers is the most significant example yet of the president-elect favoring powerful elements in his new MAGA coalition over his base\u2019s anti-immigrant DNA that he twice tapped in his rise to power.\n\nThe boiling holiday feud over H-1B visas exposed new fissures across Trump\u2019s broadened support base and reflected the contradictions between his populist ideology and the self-interests of many of the key players in his refashioned inner circle.\n\nAfter several days of silence over the controversy, the president-elect stepped in, making clear he supported Musk\u2019s argument for recruitment flexibility for the tech industry.\n\nMusk, the richest man in the world, made his case in a series of outspoken posts on X. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,\u201d he wrote to one critic on the platform that he owns. \u201cI will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.\u201d\n\nThe visa issue erupted into a full-blown storm following comments by Vivek Ramaswamy, Musk\u2019s co-chair of the Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump has set up to slash the size of federal operations. The former GOP presidential candidate criticized American culture, education standards and children\u2019s TV that he said \u201cvenerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.\u201d The comments came perilously close to an elitist\u2019s disdain for millions of Americans and their culture that Republicans have long accused Democrats of promoting.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, Steve Bannon, who served in the first Trump administration, blasted H-1B visas on his \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast as a \u201cscam\u201d by Silicon Valley oligarchs that are about \u201ctaking American jobs and bringing over what essentially become indentured servants at lower wages.\u201d\n\nWhy the H-1B visa issue has divided the MAGA movement\n\nH-1B visas allow the brightest foreign workers, many of them engineers and computer scientists, to live and work in the US. Supporters say they\u2019re vital to ensuring Silicon Valley innovation continues to lead the world. The issue has become broader than a mere economic question: because of artificial intelligence and new generation computing, the industry is now critical to US defense and national security.\n\nBut some of Trump\u2019s most vocal and committed MAGA supporters have blasted the visas as inconsistent with the America First and anti-immigration philosophy on which the president-elect built his appeal. Some critics of the system also argue that by importing foreign workers, the US government blocks the path to advancement for American workers and college graduates, including minorities.\n\nOne case is insufficient evidence to judge whether Trump\u2019s favoring of the Tesla and SpaceX pioneer will set the tone for a presidency over which Musk already holds considerable sway. And Trump defies patterns by acting on his gut and keeping opponents off-balance, so it would be risky to see the H1-B visa issue as a wider metaphor for how the administration will unfold.\n\nHowever, Musk\u2019s capacity to use X to spread his message, as well as Trump\u2019s eventual blessing for his argument, underscores the huge power he commands as the ubiquitous but unelected sidekick of the president-elect. Earlier this month, for example, Musk came out ahead of Trump and used his platform to help tank a bipartisan funding bill in the House, sending the government perilously close to a shutdown.\n\nHis influence could have implications beyond immigration policy. Musk\u2019s vast business before the US government \u2014 across multiple sectors of the space industry, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence \u2014 could quickly cause multiple conflicts of interest. And he has enormous sway abroad \u2014 including in countries like China, where the hawkish views of some of Trump\u2019s top Cabinet picks also risk colliding with the tech mogul\u2019s priorities.\n\nHow immigration became a driving force for Trump\u2019s rise\n\nH-1B nonimmigrant visas allow American firms to temporarily employ foreign workers with specialized knowledge and advanced academic qualifications to help them stay globally competitive. Proponents say the system is not intended to replace American workers but to fill vital gaps for specialized workers that the US workforce cannot satisfy. The visas have often been used by South Asian workers nurtured in India\u2019s thriving high-tech industries to come to the United States and build a prosperous diaspora.\n\nIn isolation, attempts to expand the H-1B visa program would not seem incompatible with Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policy and promise of a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants to begin soon after he\u2019s sworn in next month.\n\nBut nearly two decades of bipartisan attempts to overhaul and solidify the H-1B program have largely failed, often as broad immigration reform plans foundered on the polarization of immigration politics that Trump used to fuel his rise to power in 2016 and again in 2024.\n\nTrump has now made clear he agrees with Musk and said he\u2019d sometimes used H-1B visas in his businesses, although he\u2019s more frequently employed temporary part-time foreign workers on H-2B visas at his golf resorts and hotels.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That\u2019s why we have them,\u201d Trump told The New York Post on Saturday about the H-1B system.\n\nMusk made the case for expanding the program in one of his less explosive posts on X. \u201cWe should greatly increase legal immigration of anyone who is hard-working, honest and loves America,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery such person is an asset to the country. But massive illegal immigration of people we know nothing about is insane.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the South Africa-born immigrant argue that his success in disrupting and reinventing industries like space exploration and low-carbon transportation mean he\u2019s exactly the kind of person who should be at the center of government, innovating in Washington.\n\nBut the tech mogul also has clear self-interests in remaining close to the next president, given his billions of dollars in contracts with the US government. And his new position at DOGE ostensibly gives him the capacity to slash regulations that constrain his own ventures.\n\nMusk\u2019s zeal for defending H-1B visas appears to be a signal that he will not shirk from aggressively pushing his agenda when Trump is president. It will be up to the president-elect to decide how he responds.\n\nTrump opponents warn a MAGA civil war has broken out\n\nLiberal social media pundits delighted in highlighting a \u201ccivil war\u201d in the MAGA movement. But there\u2019s nothing necessarily new about a president presiding over feuding parties in his coalition.\n\nTrump, for instance, often seems to invite conflict among his aides. And even President Joe Biden had to manage antagonism between the progressive and more moderate wings of the Democratic Party early in his administration.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Trump\u2019s ability to reconcile the differing interests among conservative budget hawks, hardline MAGA lawmakers and comparative moderates who may be vulnerable in 2026 general elections will dictate the fate of his aggressive legislative plans on immigration, budget trimming and tax cuts.\n\nBut there\u2019s no modern precedent for a faction of a president\u2019s power base being led by someone as rich, mercurial and powerful as Musk with immediate access to a mighty social media network. Republican lawmakers, for instance, spoke before Christmas about how the phones in their offices suddenly lit up when Musk called for the gutting of House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s initial year-end spending bill.\n\nAnd the Tesla chief\u2019s advocacy for the lucrative high-tech industry on the West Coast feels a million miles away from the economic concerns expressed by Trump\u2019s core supporters and the low-propensity voters in the suburbs who paved his way back to the White House.\n\nThe president-elect ran on reducing the price of eggs and bacon after a punishing round of inflation \u2014 yet he\u2019s largely chosen a Cabinet of billionaires and millionaires who\u2019ve not had to worry about such matters for years. If Trump\u2019s Cabinet secretaries are as zealous in pursuing their personal goals as Musk is, his administration\u2019s policy may appear inconsistent and out of touch.\n\n\u2018President Musk?\u2019\n\nThe uproar over tech visas also revived one of the transition\u2019s most intriguing questions. How long will Trump tolerate Musk\u2019s capacity to dominate political debate in a way that only he can match? Skeptics are convinced that the president-elect will soon tire of Musk\u2019s ubiquity. Democrats have already tried to fracture their relationship by referring to \u201cPresident Musk.\u201d And the lesson of Trump\u2019s first term is that those who overshadow him soon find themselves exiting his orbit or becoming a scapegoat when things go wrong.\n\nThis may be how things develop. But both Trump and Musk have huge incentives to stick together. Musk will never be able to replicate the inside government perch that he can use to promote his interests. And Republicans will be banking on the SpaceX chief\u2019s financial might as the midterm elections approach after he poured tens of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign.\n\nBut a deeper reality may postpone a possible schism between Trump and Musk. Each has the capacity to wreak destruction on the other. The president-elect will soon be able to wield the federal government as an instrument of revenge. But someone as social media savvy as Trump, who\u2019s spun falsehoods into a reality to which millions of Americans are committed, would surely balk at making an enemy of the man who controls X.",

            "content": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers.\n\nMusk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations.\n\nThe tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.\n\nThat debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture \"has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" leading to a nation that does \"not produce the best engineers.\"\n\n\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app.\n\nHere's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa.\n\nHow did the most recent H-1B debate begin?\n\nThe debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.\n\nLoomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.\n\nLoomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.\n\nIt bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.\n\nWho qualifies for an H-1B visa?\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.\n\nThose professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.\n\nHow many workers receive H-1B visas?\n\nThe U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.\n\nHowever, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.\n\nWhat countries do H-1B recipients come from?\n\nMore than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.\n\nWhat's the debate about H-1B visas?\n\nTechnology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.\n\nBut critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.\n\nSome investigations, including a 2017 report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.\n\nWhat does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?\n\nTrump has not officially outlined his policy preferences on the H-1B program, but he told The New York Post in a Dec. 28 interview that he has \"always been in favor of the visas.\"\n\n\"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times; it's a great program,\" he added. His presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nStill, Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge to conduct mass deportations, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.\n\nAs a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \"very bad\" and \"unfair\" for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.\n\nIn 2020, the Trump administration required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move they argued would discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad.\n\ncontributed to this report.",
