            "content": "It's growing its earnings significantly faster than either big-box store.\n\nRetail sales remained strong in 2024, but two companies stood out for their significant gains in market share over the last two years. Walmart (WMT 1.84%) and Costco (COST 1.85%) both saw even stronger sales growth than the rest of the industry, fueled by improvements in e-commerce and at the store level.\n\nInvestors certainly noticed, and sent both stocks flying higher. Shares of Walmart and Costco currently trade 81% and 98% higher than they did at the start of 2023, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 during that period.\n\nWith the recent pullback in stock prices, it may be tempting to pile into these two market leaders. While they may face headwinds from the current U.S. administration's trade policies, both have significant competitive advantages that should endure over the long run. In fact, they could benefit if prices increase, as shoppers look for lower-cost options.\n\nBut there's another retail giant that looks even more attractive than Walmart or Costco. Not only is the stock less expensive, it's poised to grow earnings even faster.\n\nBuy this retail stock while it's on sale\n\nIf there's one driving force behind the stellar success of both Walmart and Costco, it's their shifts to drive more online sales. Both saw U.S. e-commerce sales grow more than 20% year over year in their most recent quarters, supporting their strong same-store sales growth. Both are growing faster than the overall e-commerce market in the U.S., despite their size.\n\nBut neither one is catching up with the market leader, Amazon (AMZN 3.58%). While Amazon only grew its online store sales 8% and its third-party seller services 9% last quarter, it's working from a much bigger base than anyone in the industry. As a result, Amazon actually managed to increase its share of e-commerce last year.\n\nWhat's more, it's driving those results while improving profitability. Amazon's North America segment produced an operating margin of 6.4% in 2024. That's up from 4.2% in 2023 and negative 0.9% in 2022. In comparison, Walmart's operating margin for Walmart U.S. was just 5.2%, and Costco's operating margin over the last 12 months is 3.7%.\n\nAmazon's international segment is also showing signs of improved profitability. It went from consistently producing an operating loss to $3.8 billion in operating income last year.\n\nThere are two factors driving the improved profitability at Amazon.\n\nFirst, it overhauled its logistics network to a regionalized model starting in 2023. The move made it less expensive and faster to move items from its warehouses to customers' homes.\n\nSecond, Amazon has seen significant growth in its retail media advertising business and other digital ads. Ad sales have incredibly high margins, as they mostly represent incremental revenue on top of its existing business. Amazon's ad sales grew 18% in the fourth quarter to $17.3 billion, representing a growing portion of its total revenue.\n\nWhile Walmart and Costco worked to improve their operating margins in recent years, Amazon is making much faster and more promising progress while continuing to grow faster than either brick-and-mortar retailer.\n\nBut investors get something else with Amazon that they don't get with either Costco or Walmart, and it could be worth even more than its retail operations.\n\nThe massive tech company behind Amazon's retail success\n\nAmazon also operates the largest public cloud platform in the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS generated more than $100 billion in revenue last year and produced an operating margin of 37%. Not only that, its profitability is improving as it scales thanks to strong demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. AWS generated almost $40 billion in operating income last year, up 62% from 2023.\n\nImportantly, it looks like that's poised to continue growing. Management noted demand for compute continues to outstrip its supply. That should provide a long runway of continued growth in 2025, and support Amazon's massive spending on data centers. The company spent $26.3 billion on capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, and CFO Brian Olsavsky said investors can expect a similar run rate throughout 2025. In other words, it'll spend more than $100 billion, mostly on data centers, but also on supporting its retail logistics network and fulfillment capacity.\n\nAWS should continue to be a significant growth driver for Amazon's profits, overshadowing the excellent progress it's making on the retail side. But despite the strong earnings growth Amazon's producing, the market's still offering the stock at a great price.\n\nIt's cheaper than Walmart and Costco\n\nAs of this writing, you can buy shares of Amazon for about 30 times forward earnings. Walmart trades for 32 times earnings, and Costco trades for a lofty 50 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nOne might argue all three are overpriced, trading for such rich valuations relative to the market. But Amazon's stock looks extremely attractive at this current multiple. First of all, it's growing earnings significantly faster than its retail peers. Amazon's earnings per share are set to climb 15% this year, compared to 9% for Costco and 5% for Walmart.\n\nAlso, its current valuation, on a price-to-earnings basis, is at a historic low for the stock. In comparison, Costco recently traded for a historically high valuation, and Walmart is trading in the upper end of its valuation range as well.\n\nImportantly, if you look out to 2026, when Amazon should benefit from the massive investments it's making in AWS, analysts expect earnings growth to accelerate. The current consensus estimate calls for $7.59 per share, up 20% on top of this year's 15% expected growth.\n\nAll this makes Amazon a far more appealing investment than either Walmart or Costco.",

One company that could benefit from the current economic conditions is Walmart (NYSE: WMT), a favorite retailer among price-conscious shoppers.\n\nWalmart stock has dropped nearly 20% from its all-time high in February. Let's review its latest earnings results, management capital allocation strategy, and outlook to determine whether it's a buy, sell, or hold.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWalmart continues to grow, but profitability lags\n\nWalmart recently reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. It generated an incredible $180.6 billion in revenue, representing a 4.1% year-over-year increase. However, the retailer saw its net income decrease from $5.7 billion to $5.3 billion.\n\nThe company faced higher costs of sales (up 3.3% year over year) and higher operating, selling, general and administrative expenses (up 6.5% year over year). Regarding the latter increase, management pointed to growing e-commerce sales, which now make up 18% of Walmart's net sales, and cost more than its traditional brick-and-mortar stores. In the long term, management believes that supply chain automation will improve those expenses.\n\nWalmart prioritizes returning capital to shareholders\n\nAs for what Walmart is doing with its profits, the company spends approximately half of them returning capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\n\nNotably, the company holds the prestigious title of Dividend King, signifying that it has not only paid but also increased its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. Its most recent dividend hike -- its 52nd in a row -- was an impressive 13%, bringing the quarterly payout to $0.235 per share. This translates to an annual yield of 1.1%.The company also has a relatively low payout ratio -- the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends -- at around 34%, meaning future increases likely won't pressure the company's other goals.\n\nWalmart allocated $4.5 billion to share repurchases in fiscal year 2025, using a tax-efficient method of returning capital to shareholders. Unlike dividends, which trigger a taxable event for recipients, buybacks increase each remaining shareholder's ownership stake without immediate tax consequences. With $12 billion still available under its current repurchase program, management will likely continue further lowering its outstanding shares, which have declined 17% over the past decade.\n\nHere's what lies ahead for Walmart\n\nAmid a potentially rocky economic outlook with uncertainty around tariffs and rising unemployment rates in the U.S., Walmart's management remains cautiously optimistic for its fiscal year 2026.\n\n\"Our outlook assumes a relatively stable macroeconomic environment but acknowledges that there are still uncertainties related to consumer behavior and global economic and geopolitical conditions,\" CEO Doug McMillon noted on the company's most recent earnings call. \"We remain confident that Walmart is well-positioned to navigate as it has over the last several years while continuing to deliver value for customers and shareholders alike.\"\n\nDigging into the outlook specifics for Walmart's fiscal year 2026, management projects net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) between $2.50 and $2.60. If the latter were to actualize, it would represent little to no growth from fiscal year 2025's EPS of $2.51. Notably, management cited a higher effective tax rate and foreign exchange headwinds, which are expected to reduce EPS by $0.05 per share.\n\nIn the long term, management believes membership growth with Walmart+, its warehouse retailer brand Sam's Club, and its advertising business will be a growth driver. The company's \"membership and other income\" segments grew from $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $6.5 billion in fiscal year 2025, or 17.5%. Additionally, the company's global advertising segment increased 27% year over year to approximately $4.4 billion.\n\nWhat to do with Walmart's stock\n\nBefore buying any stock, it's crucial to assess its valuation. For a mature, profitable company like Walmart, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a useful metric, as it allows you to compare its current valuation to historical averages. Currently, Walmart trades at 35.6 times earnings, above its five-year median of 31, suggesting a premium valuation.\n\nFinancial stability is another key factor. Walmart carries $30 billion in net debt, which cost $2.3 billion to service in fiscal year 2025. While the company reduced its net debt by 25% over the past three years and can comfortably manage its obligations, the debt still weighs on the business and can limit growth opportunities.\n\nOverall, Walmart stock isn't a screaming \"buy\" due to its high valuation and sluggish earnings growth. However, Walmart's valuation shouldn't scare off income-seeking investors, as the company's dividend longevity and growth make it a solid long-term hold.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Patrick Crusius, who has admitted to killing 23 people and wounding 22 others in a racist mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart in 2019, will no longer face the death penalty, El Paso Matters has learned.\n\nDistrict Attorney James Montoya, who took office on Jan. 1, called family members of those killed on Monday to inform them he wouldn\u2019t seek the death penalty in the Aug. 3, 2019, mass shooting, multiple family members told El Paso Matters. The family members asked not to be identified because of a gag order in place since 2022 that prohibited lawyers and potential witnesses from discussing the case with the media.\n\nMontoya declined to comment when contacted by El Paso Matters on Monday, citing the gag order. Defense attorney Joe Spencer also cited the gag order in declining comment.\n\nThe removal of the death penalty as an option could lead to a quick guilty plea and life sentence, as happened with federal charges in 2023.\n\nJames Montoya\n\nCrusius drove more than 10 hours from his home in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs on Aug. 3, 2019, and chose the Cielo Vista Walmart for his attack. Using a semiautomatic rifle, he killed 23 people and wounded 22 others. Officials have said there\u2019s no evidence anyone else was involved in the attack.\n\nShortly before the shooting, he posted a screed to a website frequented by white supremacists, saying the attack was meant \u201cto stop the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d\n\nCrusius surrendered to police officers a short time after the shooting while driving on Viscount Boulevard.\n\nThe attack remains the sixth-deadliest mass shooting in United States history, and the deadliest terror attack aimed at Hispanics.\n\nIt is the deadliest U.S. mass shooting in which a suspect was captured and charged. Many mass shooters take their own lives or are killed by police.\n\nThe people killed in the Aug. 3, 2019, mass shooting at the Cielo Vista Walmart in El Paso: Andre Anchondo, 23\n\nJordan Anchondo, 24\n\nArturo Benavides, 60\n\nLeonardo Campos, 41\n\nAngie Englisbee, 86\n\nMaria Flores, 77\n\nRaul Flores, 83\n\nGuillermo \u201cMemo\u201d Garcia, 36\n\nJorge Calvillo Garc\u00eda, 61\n\nAdolfo Cerros Hern\u00e1ndez, 68\n\nAlexander Gerhard Hoffman, 66\n\nDavid Johnson, 63\n\nLuis Alfonzo Juarez, 90\n\nMaria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, 58\n\nMaribel (Campos) Loya, 56\n\nIvan Filiberto Manzano, 46\n\nElsa Mendoza Marquez, 57\n\nGloria Irma M\u00e1rquez, 61\n\nMargie Reckard, 63\n\nSara Esther Regalado Moriel, 66\n\nJavier Rodriguez, 15\n\nTeresa Sanchez, 82\n\nJuan Velazquez, 77\n\nIn January 2023, the U.S. Justice Department announced that it would not seek the death penalty for the federal weapons and hate crimes charges Crusius faced. He quickly pleaded guilty and in July 2023 was sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms in federal prison, with a nonbinding recommendation from the judge that he serve his sentence in the nation\u2019s most secure prison in Florence, Colorado.\n\nThe federal system does not include the possibility of parole.\n\nKaitlyn Melendez, then age 9, was with her grandfather, David Johnson, when he was among 23 people shot to death by Patrick Crusius at an El Paso Walmart on Aug. 3, 2019. She was accompanied by a service dog as she gave a victim impact statement July 5, 2023, at the first day of Crusius\u2019 sentencing hearing. (Nacho Garcia Jr./El Paso Matters)\n\nThe Justice Department refused to say why it made the decision to not seek capital punishment. But the prosecution and defense both said during the sentencing hearing that Crusius had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by delusions or hallucinations.\n\nMontoya\u2019s three predecessors as district attorney \u2013 Jaime Esparza, Yvonne Rosales and Bill Hicks \u2013 all said they would seek the death penalty against Crusius.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that the Walmart shooter will not face a jury for his crimes, but the decision to move forward with a trial or to enter a plea agreement is completely within the discretion of the district attorney and it is totally DA Montoya\u2019s decision at this point, not mine. I respect how difficult it must have been to make this decision,\u201d said Hicks, who was appointed district attorney by Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022 and was defeated by Montoya in the November 2024 general election.\n\nTo order that a convicted killer in Texas be put to death, a jury must find unanimously that the person represents a future danger. The defense could have argued at trial that a sentence in the nation\u2019s highest security prison would mean Crusius no longer presented a danger.\n\nIf a jury determines that someone represents a future danger, it then must weigh aggravating factors such as the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the extreme violence of the crime against mitigating factors such as mental health in determining whether to recommend death or life in prison.\n\nThe state capital murder case was essentially put on hold to allow the federal prosecution to move forward first. The COVID-19 pandemic created complications for both the federal and state cases.\n\nThe state case was complicated by the troubled two-year tenure of Rosales as district attorney. She faced repeated accusations of failing to move criminal cases forward, including the Walmart shooting. One of her associates also was accused of targeting the family of one of those killed at the Walmart because the family wouldn\u2019t go along with a plan to criticize the judge and a former prosecutor.\n\nDistrict Attorney Yvonne Rosales appears in a hearing before Judge Sam Medrano on July 1, 2022. (Corrie Boudreaux/El Paso Matters)\n\nRosales resigned in December 2022 as she faced a petition to remove her from office on the grounds that she was incompetent. Gov. Greg Abbott appointed Hicks to replace Rosales.\n\nCrusius\u2019 lawyers have alleged prosecutorial misconduct by Rosales and Hicks in the handling of the case. Hicks has said his office has done nothing wrong and Rosales has faded from public view and not commented on the allegations.\n\nAt the end of 2024, two judges ruled that prosecutors in the District Attorney\u2019s Office had acted improperly in a number of cases by altering court records and withholding evidence from defense lawyers. Crusius\u2019 attorneys likely would have used those findings as they pressed their misconduct allegations against prosecutors in the Walmart case.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

Patel is charged with kidnapping, simple assault, and simple battery, and authorities are investigating potential links to other crimes. The child's father emphasizes the importance of vigilance and immediate action in similar situations, urging parents and bystanders to stay alert and call for help.\n\n\n\nA Cobb County family is breathing a sigh of relief after a terrifying encounter inside a Walmart that ended with a 2-year-old boy safe and a suspect in custody.\n\nPolice say 56-year-old Mahendra Patel is behind bars after attempting to snatch the toddler from his mother\u2019s arms last week inside the Walmart on Cobb Parkway.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe incident happened on March 18 at the Walmart located at 3105 Cobb Parkway. According to investigators, 56-year-old Mahendra Patel approached a mother in the store and asked her about Tylenol. Witnesses told police that Patel then grabbed her child.\n\nThe mother was able to safely pull her child away, and Patel fled the store, authorities said.\n\nUsing store surveillance footage and FLOCK camera technology, detectives identified Patel and arrested him three days later. He is being held without bond at the Cobb County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nPatel was arrested and was booked into the Cobb County Jail, charged with kidnapping, simple assault and simple battery. Authorities say they are working with other law enforcement agencies to determine whether Patel may be connected to additional crimes in the area.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nJeremiah Walker, the child\u2019s father, says his fianc\u00e9e was shopping with their two children \u2014 a 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son Jude \u2014 when the incident occurred.\n\n\"The guy asked where the Tylenol was and proceeded to grab him, and she pulled back and said, \u2018No, no, what are you doing,\u2019\" Walker said.\n\nWalker says his family is still shaken but grateful. \"She was shaking for an hour after that, physically you could see she was shaking,\" he said.\n\nHe\u2019s now keeping his young son even closer. \"Terrifying though \u2014 I can't even imagine not having him,\" Walker said. \"Keep them very close.\"\n\nWalker hopes the experience serves as a reminder for all parents and bystanders to stay alert. \"If you see something like that happening, you scream immediately,\" he said. \"You call attention, you call for help and scream as loud as you can. That way if anything were to happen, people are looking, people are paying attention.\"\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nAnyone with additional information about the case is urged to contact the Acworth Police Department at 770-974-1232.",

            "content": "Similarly, the strong US job market is also showing early signs of stress, with unemployment rising and job growth slowing. These trends have greatly affected the previously red-hot stock market, with fears surrounding a potential recession emerging. CNBC reported that executives and investors are concerned about the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on consumer spending, leading to additional worries about an administration from which they previously had optimistic hopes. While the weak companies are already taking on a cautious approach, even the strong ones are jumping on the bandwagon and preparing for an uncertain future.\n\nConsumer confidence reports, which show how much money shoppers are spending to gauge their patterns, corroborate these claims. According to CNBC, consumer confidence in February showed its biggest drop since 2021. Another consumer sentiment measure for March showed even worse results. The University of Michigan Survey of Consumers for March posted a 57.9 reading, down 10.5% from February levels and standing below the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 63.2. In addition, the one-year inflation outlook rose to 4.9%, the highest reading since November 2022. The outlook at the five-year horizon also bubbled to 3.9%, the highest since February 1993.\n\nCNBC reported that several executives opined that a \u201cdynamic\u201d macroenvironment and unseasonably cool weather were the culprits behind this trend. However, with President Trump\u2019s second term continuing to unfold, new challenges are beginning to emerge. Trade policies reflect inherent uncertainty, as they seem to shift by the hour. Experts and economists anticipate that the effects of new tariffs on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican goods will be felt across the economy, elevating prices for consumers and hampering spending in an environment where inflation is already higher than the Fed\u2019s target.\n\nOver the last weeks, investor presentations and earnings calls have shown a distinct trend: consumer-facing businesses and retailers are warning that fiscal Q1 2025 sales are coming in softer than expected. 2025 may prove to be a year tougher than what analysts initially estimated.\n\nConsumer sentiment is taking a hit in the US, with threats of a potential recession looming across the market. Company leaders, ranging from affordable grocery stores to luxury goods sellers, are noticing cracks in demand, which reflects a notable trend shift from the resilient consumers who supported the US economy for years, even during elongated periods of inflation. On March 14, CNBC reported that while headwinds like persistent inflation and high interest rates were already affecting companies, they now have to deal with additional obstacles such as worsening consumer sentiment, tariffs that go on and off, and mass government layoffs.\n\nWe recently published a list of the 10 Best Department Store Stocks to Invest in . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) stands against the other best department store stocks to invest in.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEd Stack, chairman of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, expressed similar sentiments in a CNBC interview, saying:\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s just a bit of an uncertain world out there right now. What\u2019s going to happen from a tariff standpoint? You know, if tariffs are put in place and prices rise the way that they might, what\u2019s going to happen with the consumer?\u201d\n\nSeveral companies in the sector managed to surpass S&P 500 performance in the past year, even during a decrease in discretionary spending. Therefore, the current shift presents a notable industry point and might be a warning sign that consumers are beginning to crack. Even excellent execution may not be able to shield companies from tariff-induced price rises after four years of historic inflation. On the other hand, companies who already spent last year dealing with uncertain consumer trends and dynamics are sounding even more skeptical.\n\nDollar General CEO Todd Vasos discussed the ongoing situation in the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 2024 earnings call, adding that customers are expecting value and convenience \u201cmore than ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year, as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of our customers report they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities. As we enter 2025, we are not anticipating an improvement in the macro environment, particularly for our core customer.\u201d\n\nAmerican Eagle CEO Jay Schottenstein also shed light on the situation in the following words:\n\n\u2033[Consumers] have the fear of the unknown. Not just tariffs, not just inflation, we see the government cutting people off. They don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to affect them. They see programs being cut, they don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to affect them. And when people don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know \u2013 they get very conservative \u2026 it makes everyone a little nervous.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, financial media reports, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 department store stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds, as of Q4 2024, and ranked them in ascending order. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWas Jim Cramer Right About Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) Canada announced plans to spend $4.51 billion on new stores, reflecting supply-chain expansion. As part of the initiative, the company plans to open dozens of stores nationwide, starting with opening five supercenters in Ontario and Alberta by 2027, two of which are set to open this year.\n\nIn a report released on March 20, Mark Astrachan from Stifel Nicolaus maintained a Buy rating on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), with a price target of $93.00. Its median price target of $87.04 implies an upside of 26.38% from current levels.\n\nOverall, WMT ranks 1st on our list of the best department store stocks to invest in.

Officials have said there\u2019s no evidence anyone else was involved in the attack.\n\nShortly before the shooting, he posted a screed to a website frequented by white supremacists, saying the attack was meant \u201cto stop the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d\n\nCrusius surrendered to police officers a short time after the shooting while driving on Viscount Boulevard.\n\nThe attack remains the sixth-deadliest mass shooting in United States history, and the deadliest terror attack aimed at Hispanics.\n\nIt is the deadliest U.S. mass shooting in which a suspect was captured and charged. Many mass shooters take their own lives or are killed by police.\n\nThe people killed in the Aug. 3, 2019, mass shooting at the Cielo Vista Walmart in El Paso:\n\nAndre Anchondo, 23\n\nJordan Anchondo, 24\n\nArturo Benavides, 60\n\nLeonardo Campos, 41\n\nAngie Englisbee, 86\n\nMaria Flores, 77\n\nRaul Flores, 83\n\nGuillermo \u201cMemo\u201d Garcia, 36\n\nJorge Calvillo Garc\u00eda, 61\n\nAdolfo Cerros Hern\u00e1ndez, 68\n\nAlexander Gerhard Hoffman, 66\n\nDavid Johnson, 63\n\nLuis Alfonzo Juarez, 90\n\nMaria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, 58\n\nMaribel (Campos) Loya, 56\n\nIvan Filiberto Manzano, 46\n\nElsa Mendoza Marquez, 57\n\nGloria Irma M\u00e1rquez, 61\n\nMargie Reckard, 63\n\nSara Esther Regalado Moriel, 66\n\nJavier Rodriguez, 15\n\nTeresa Sanchez, 82\n\nJuan Velazquez, 77\n\nIn January 2023, the U.S. Justice Department announced that it would not seek the death penalty for the federal weapons and hate crimes charges Crusius faced. He quickly pleaded guilty and in July 2023 was sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms in federal prison, with a nonbinding recommendation from the judge that he serve his sentence in the nation\u2019s most secure prison in Florence, Colorado.\n\nThe federal system does not include the possibility of parole.\n\nThe Justice Department refused to say why it made the decision to not seek capital punishment. But the prosecution and defense both said during the sentencing hearing that Crusius had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by delusions or hallucinations.\n\nMontoya\u2019s three predecessors as district attorney \u2013 Jaime Esparza, Yvonne Rosales and Bill Hicks \u2013 all said they would seek the death penalty against Crusius.\n\nTo order that a convicted killer in Texas be put to death, a jury must find unanimously that the person represents a future danger. The defense could have argued at trial that a sentence in the nation\u2019s highest security prison would mean Crusius no longer presented a danger.\n\nIf a jury determines that someone represents a future danger, it then must weigh aggravating factors such as the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the extreme violence of the crime against mitigating factors such as mental health in determining whether to recommend death or life in prison.\n\nThe state capital murder case was essentially put on hold to allow the federal prosecution to move forward first. The COVID-19 pandemic created complications for both the federal and state cases.\n\nThe state case was complicated by the troubled two-year tenure of Rosales as district attorney. She faced repeated accusations of failing to move criminal cases forward, including the Walmart shooting. One of her associates also was accused of targeting the family of one of those killed at the Walmart because the family wouldn\u2019t go along with a plan to criticize the judge and a former prosecutor.\n\nRosales resigned in December 2022 as she faced a petition to remove her from office on the grounds that she was incompetent. Gov. Greg Abbott appointed Hicks to replace Rosales.\n\nCrusius\u2019 lawyers have alleged prosecutorial misconduct by Rosales and Hicks in the handling of the case. Hicks has said his office has done nothing wrong and Rosales has faded from public view and not commented on the allegations.\n\nAt the end of 2024, two judges ruled that prosecutors in the District Attorney\u2019s Office had acted improperly in a number of cases by altering court records and withholding evidence from defense lawyers. Crusius\u2019 attorneys likely would have used those findings as they pressed their misconduct allegations against prosecutors in the Walmart case.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\n\n\n",

See below for links to the other stocks in this series.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings as a small discount store in Rogers, Arkansas, Walmart (WMT) has grown into a global retail powerhouse, transforming the way the world shops.\n\nHow did a single store become the largest retailer in the world, with over $600 billion in annual revenue? The answer lies in Walmart's unique approach to expansion and its relentless focus on cost control.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Together, these factors reveal the secrets behind Walmart's sustained growth and its ability to dominate the global market.\n\nA major driver of Walmart's growth has been its aggressive expansion strategy. In 2000, Walmart operated 3,662 stores worldwide including Supercenters, discount stores, and Sam's Clubs .\n\nBy 2023, the number of stores had grown to 10,130. This rapid expansion allowed Walmart to capture a broad customer base across both urban and rural areas.\n\n(Image credit: Louis Navellier)\n\nLooking at sales per store over time provides insights into Walmart's growth strategy.\n\nIn 2000, Walmart reported a revenue of approximately $167 billion. Dividing this by its 3,662 stores results in an average sales per store of around $45.6 million.\n\nBy 2023, Walmart's revenue had surged to nearly $611 billion. With over 10,623 stores, the average sales per store had risen to approximately $57.5 million. Over time, Walmart's methods allowed it to increase the productivity of each store by 26%.\n\nImproving and maintaining gross margins has also been crucial to Walmart's ability to offer low prices and sustain profitability.\n\nWalmart's massive scale allows it to negotiate better prices with suppliers, driving down the cost of goods sold and enhancing/maintaining gross margins. For a decade, Walmart has been able to keep its gross margin in the range of 24% to 26%.\n\nYou could almost say that Walmart is impervious to inflation , and that's one reason shoppers come back to Walmart again and again.\n\nAmazingly, during the peak inflation of 2022, when the rate in the U.S. peaked at 9.1%, Walmart was able to maintain its gross margin at 24.1% that year, only 4% lower than the previous year's gross margin of 25.1%.\n\nAnd when inflation abated in 2023, Walmart's gross margin was able to bounce back to 26.2%.\n\nThe company has leveraged its buying power to source goods at lower prices and invested in technology to enhance inventory management. These efforts have allowed Walmart to reduce the cost of goods sold and maintain its \"Everyday Low Price\" strategy, attracting price-sensitive customers and driving sales volume.\n\nDespite economic fluctuations and changing market conditions, Walmart's ability to adapt and leverage its massive scale has enabled it to thrive.\n\nAs the largest retailer in the world, Walmart continues to shape the retail industry, demonstrating that a well-executed growth strategy and a relentless focus on cost control works.\n\nThe formula is still valid, and Walmart likely has more growth to deliver to shareholders.\n\nNote: This content first appeared in Louis Navellier's latest book, The Sacred Truths of Investing: Finding Growth Stocks that Will Make You Rich , which was published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

            "content": "Photo by Marques Thomas on Unsplash\n\nWalmart is expanding its footprint once again \u2014 this time at the pump.\n\nThe retail giant recently announced plans to open or remodel more than 45 Fuel and Convenience stations across the United States in 2025, further solidifying its position as a leader in value, accessibility, and convenience.\n\nThe move is part of the retail giant\u2019s ongoing investment in its vast network of physical locations. By enhancing its Fuel and Convenience services, Walmart is positioning itself as a destination for groceries and household essentials and as a go-to stop for affordable fuel and quick purchases. Currently, the retail giant operates over 400 Fuel and Convenience stations nationwide. With this year\u2019s expansion, that number will surpass 450 locations across 34 states.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Strategy Built on Convenience and Value\n\nThe expansion of the company\u2019s Fuel and Convenience stations aligns with the company\u2019s broader strategy of offering customers everyday low prices and an enhanced one-stop shopping experience, per a press release shared with RetailWire. According to Dave DeSerio, VP of Fuel and Convenience for Walmart U.S., the investment reflects the company\u2019s commitment to delivering more value to its customers \u2014 especially those already loyal to the brand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to invest in our nationwide, physical store footprint. By adding dozens of Fuel and Convenience stations this year, we are bringing even more value to our customers,\u201d DeSerio said. \u201cCustomers shop Walmart for our everyday low prices and convenience offerings, and fuel stations are another example of us responding to our customer and member needs.\u201d\n\nUnlike traditional gas stations, the Fuel and Convenience locations allow customers to enjoy the same low prices on snacks, beverages, and other quick essentials as they would inside a Walmart store. This consistency reinforces the company\u2019s value proposition while offering shoppers the convenience of in-and-out service.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalmart+ Members Benefit at the Pump\n\nOne of the key incentives driving Walmart\u2019s fuel expansion is its Walmart+ membership program. As part of the subscription\u2019s perks, Walmart+ members can save up to 10 cents per gallon at the Fuel and Convenience stations. This discount adds tangible value to the membership and creates a strong incentive for members to fuel up at Walmart locations rather than competitors.\n\nA discussion on RetailWire from 2022 explored how fuel perks could influence consumer behavior. Industry experts agreed at the time that fuel discounts were a powerful motivator for membership programs, especially when gas prices continue to fluctuate.\n\nStrengthening Walmart\u2019s Physical Footprint\n\nWhile much of the retail world is focusing on e-commerce and last-mile delivery, Walmart\u2019s fuel station expansion signals the retailer\u2019s continued confidence in the power of its physical locations. With more than 4,600 stores nationwide, Walmart\u2019s real estate presence is unmatched. Adding or enhancing Fuel and Convenience stations within that network allows the company to increase the utility of its stores and strengthen its local market share.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe company\u2019s expansion of Fuel and Convenience services reflects a broader trend: Customers want more value and convenience in a single stop. Whether they\u2019re picking up groceries, grabbing snacks, or saving at the pump, Walmart\u2019s growing network of Fuel and Convenience stations meets those needs.\n\nWith over 450 locations expected by the end of the year, the retail giant is well on its way to becoming a key player in the nation\u2019s fuel economy. The retailer\u2019s ability to leverage its scale, physical presence, and membership program makes this expansion a logical step in maintaining its leadership in retail \u2014 and now, at the pump.\n\nAs DeSerio aptly put it, the retail giant listens to its customers. And with this expansion, the company is ensuring that when it comes to convenience, value, and fueling up, Walmart remains the ultimate one-stop shop.",

            "content": "by Sarah Mahoney @mahoney_sarah, February 8, 2025\n\nAmazon\u2019s fourth-quarter financial report beat expectations, with sales climbing 10% to $187.8 billion, which likely means company revenues will top Walmart\u2019s for the first time. Advertising sales continue to grow, rising 18% to $17.29 billion. Net income jumped 89% to $20 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThat\u2019s all good news for Amazon. Yet investors focused on the company\u2019s tepid forecast for the months ahead, calling for sales between $151 billion and $155.5 billion, which would mean a growth rate of 5% to 9%. The company attributed the lower numbers to the expected impact of foreign currency rates.\n\nThat range is well below industry expectations. \u201cStill, we expect some conservatism embedded in management's outlook,\u201d writes Scott Devitt, an analyst who follows the company for Wedbush. \u201cThe company has outperformed the high end of its operating income guidance in the last eight quarters.\u201d\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nWalmart reports quarterly results later this month, and analysts anticipate that the retailer\u2019s sales will reach $180 billion, below Amazon\u2019s $187 billion.\n\nIn addition to Amazon's dethroning Walmart, \u201cthis is also the most operating income the company has ever generated in a quarter with the highest retail margins we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d writes Mark Shmulik, who follows the company for Bernstein.\n\nAndy Jassy, Amazon president and CEO, used the forecast-beating results as an occasion to call out some of the company\u2019s successes, including a record-breaking Black Friday Week and Cyber Monday deal event.\n\n\u201cThe holiday shopping season was the most successful yet for Amazon,\u201d he said in the announcement, including 50 million worldwide viewers to \u201cRed One\u201d in the first four days, making it Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 most-watched film debut ever on Prime Video. The company also notched an 11% gain in \"Thursday Night Football\" viewers, compared to the prior year.\n\nIn a call webcast for investors, Jassy said sponsored products, the largest portion of ad revenue, \u201care doing well, and we see the runway for even more growth. We also have a number of newer streaming offerings that are starting to become significant new revenue sources. On the streaming video side, we wrapped up our first year of Prime Video ads, and we're quite pleased with the early progress.\u201d\n\nAWS, the company\u2019s cloud computing division, also had a strong quarter, with sales rising 19% to $28.79 billion.\n\nBut as the ad division and AWS continue to grow, \u201cthe law of large numbers means that growth rates in advertising and AWS are tougher to come by,\u201d notes Shmulik.\n\nThe company also outperformed expectations in the physical stores business, with revenues gaining 8% to $5.58 billion. Amazon continues to tinker with its grocery strategy, with new management appointments and retooled expansion plans for Amazon Fresh.\n\nMany experts are concerned that Amazon and ecommerce companies will likely feel the brunt of new tariffs impacting Chinese trade. Morgan Stanley estimates that about 25% of Amazon\u2019s first-party products come from China, making Amazon more vulnerable than other companies.",

Here's what we know. Consumers are planning to boycott certain companies retreating from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nAdvocacy groups are promoting boycotts of major corporations to encourage support for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nThe boycotts target companies that have rolled back their DEI programs, including Target, Walmart and Amazon.\n\nOrganizers hope to demonstrate the purchasing power of consumers who support DEI and encourage companies to reinstate these programs.\n\nThe boycotts are planned throughout the spring and summer.\n\nSome groups, like the National Action Network, are encouraging support for companies like Costco that have maintained their commitment to DEI.\n\nFollowing a nationwide 24-hour economic blackout of major corporations, advocacy groups are encouraging more and more people to vote with their dollars.\n\nA weeklong boycott of Nestl\u00e9 products started Friday, and a 40-day spending freeze at Target is ongoing. A weeklong Amazon boycott also took place earlier in March.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump took office in January, he immediately started rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion at the federal level while encouraging a larger culture shift. Multiple companies, like Walmart, Lowe's and Meta have dropped their DEI programs.\n\nProtest organizers are mostly targeting major brands that have stopped DEI work, hoping to show them that shoppers want to support brands that help women, minorities, the disabled and veterans.\n\nThe NAACP is urging people to shop with Black-owned businesses and others that still have DEI programs.\n\nHere's what Mississippi shoppers should know about boycotts at Nestle and Target, along with other movements across the country.\n\nWhat we know about the Nestl\u00e9 boycott\n\nNestl\u00e9 still has a page on its website for DEI and employs a director of diversity, equity and inclusion, according to LinkedIn.\n\nJohn Schwarz, the Chicago man who formed the People's Union USA, listed multiple reasons for targeting the Swiss company in a March 17 Instagram video. Among other reasons, he cited the corporation continuing to use child labor in chocolate production. It also has drawn criticism for the low prices it pays for the water it uses when communities, like Flint, Michigan, need affordable, clean water.\n\n\"This is not just another boycott,\" Schwarz said. \"It is a direct hit to one of the most corrupt global corporations there is.\"\n\nWhat products does Nestl\u00e9 own?\n\nThe company owns thousands of brands that cover a wide range of food and health care products for families and animals including water, coffee, creamer, chocolate, candy, cereal, ice cream and pet food.\n\nAcqua Panna mineral water.\n\nmineral water. Alpo dog food.\n\ndog food. Bear Brand milk drinks.\n\nmilk drinks. Boost nutrition drinks.\n\nnutrition drinks. Carnation dessert sauces, drinks and powders.\n\ndessert sauces, drinks and powders.

Starbucks Coffee at Home products.\n\nMore: DEI explained: What is DEI and why is it so divisive? What you need to know.\n\nWhat we know about the 40-day 'Target fast' boycott\n\nThe Target boycott was organized by Atlanta Pastor Jamal Bryant and other faith leaders. They encourage people to avoid shopping at the major retail chain for the duration of Lent. They also ask investors to sell off their Target stock.\n\nIt started on Ash Wednesday, March 5, and is encouraging people to skip Target through April 17. Additional information is available at targetfast.org.\n\n40-day 'Target Fast' underway to boycott Target DEI rollbacks Pastor Dr. Jamal Bryant, leading the \"Target Fast,\" urges Target executives to restore DEI policies, hoping the boycott forces a reversal.\n\nHow many Target stores are in Mississippi?\n\nThere are Target locations in six Mississippi cities, according to its store directory.\n\nWhat boycotts are coming up?\n\nIn addition to boycotts in recent weeks, more actions are planned throughout the coming months.\n\nThe People's Union boycott will include different companies throughout the spring and into summer, according to USA TODAY. A new, broader one-day economic blackout will be on April 18 and a third is set for July 4.\n\nAn Amazon boycott was March 7-15. The Nestle one will run through March 28.\n\nHere are the brand boycotts the group is planning:\n\nWalmart : April 7-14 and May 20-26.\n\n: April 7-14 and May 20-26. General Mills : April 21-28.\n\n: April 21-28. Amazon : May 6-12.\n\n: May 6-12. Target : June 3-9.\n\n: June 3-9. McDonald's: June 24-30.\n\nSocial media posts \u2014 using #LatinoFreezeMovement and #LatinoFreeze \u2014 have also encouraged Hispanic consumers to \"hold your money\" to make statements about DEI initiatives, National Institutes of Health funding and immigration actions.\n\nThe National Action Network, founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, has encouraged support of Costco, which has kept its commitment to DEI.\n\nThe group said in a Feb. 25 news release that it will announce an authorized boycott at the NAN Convention in early April.\n\n\u201cAs I stood in Washington on King Day, just as Donald Trump put his hand on the bible and launched a crusade against DEI, I made it clear NAN will be thoughtful in how it identifies those who have gone back on our word to us. We have convened a council with our partners to examine what companies have reneged on DEI, what their profit margins are, and how we can use Black buying power to make a statement. We appreciate the spirit of the various efforts but the only one that I and NAN have authorized will be announced at our national convention this April.\" The Rev.

So, before moving into my new apartment, I decided to snag a few essentials on my wish list.\n\nTwo of my favorites are the 12-cup filtration pitcher that makes my water taste delicious and the air fryer I use at least five times a week. Below, you can shop everything I got in my latest Beautiful by Drew Barrymore Walmart haul, starting at just $13.\n\nBeautiful by Drew Barrymore Walmart Haul\n\nPur 12-Cup Water Filtration Pitcher\n\nWalmart\n\nMy new kitchen is much bigger, which has been a game changer for many reasons. One is that I can finally fit a water filtration pitcher in my fridge, so I snagged this Beautiful by Drew Barrymore version because it\u2019s so much sleeker than classic styles but still serves its purpose. The Pur filter reduces prior taste and odor from chlorine, as well as heavy metals, like mercury and copper, and pollutants like pesticides, herbicides, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nGold Vanity Mirror\n\nWalmart\n\nOne negative of my new space is that I don\u2019t have room for the vanity setup from my last apartment. I had to get creative with my get-ready station, and this small mirror makes all the difference. I keep it in my bathroom but move it about when I want to do my makeup in front of natural light or at the kitchen table. It has a storage tray and little arms for storing jewelry, beauty products, and other accessories.\n\nStainless Steel 12-Piece Knife Block Set\n\nWalmart\n\nWhile I already had some incredibly high-quality, chef-grade knives, I wanted a block set that would be readily available for chopping, slicing, and dicing. This 12-piece set looks so sleek on my countertops and offers equally impressive function. In fact, I\u2019ve rarely been reaching for any other knives. The blades are sharp enough to cut through meat and frozen veggies like butter, and the handles are comfortable and easy to grip.\n\nInfrared Air Fryer and Toaster Oven\n\nWalmart\n\nI use this infrared air fryer and toaster oven at least five times a week. I\u2019ve nearly stopped ordering takeout because it cooks food so quickly and evenly. Plus, it reheats leftovers far better than a microwave. The appliance includes 10 preset cooking functions, including toast, bagel, air fry, broil, bake, pizza, reheat, cookies, slow cook, and dehydrate, and offers a large enough capacity to feed up to seven people.\n\nOven Mitt and Pot Holder Set\n\nWalmart\n\nI owned a singular oven mitt before moving into my new apartment. So, when it mysteriously went missing in the unboxing process, I decided to get an entire set. This sage green floral version is so pretty for spring and includes an oven mitt, potholder, and two mini mitts. They really protect my hands from hot baking sheets and pan handles and are so easy to wash\u2014I simply toss them in the laundry and dryer until they\u2019re as good as new.\n\nHead over to Walmart to check out the Beautiful by Drew Barrymore collection and shop my favorite home and kitchen finds, starting at $13.\n\n",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWalmart on Tuesday introduced Wally, a generative AI assistant for its merchants .\n\nThe tool is designed to streamline time-consuming tasks for merchants in an intuitive way. Wally can conduct data entry and analysis, diagnose product performance, answer operational questions and complete advanced calculations.\n\nThe AI model used in Wally has an advanced algorithm enabling it to process larger volumes of product data. The company said it plans to continuously improve the tool with feedback from Walmart merchants.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWally is intended to help merchants better understand product performance, including why some products are under or overperforming or which categories had the largest gross merchandise value increases.\n\n\u201cBy automating time-consuming tasks and providing actionable insights, Wally enables merchants to focus on strategic, creative and innovative activities that enhance customer experiences and meet evolving customer expectations,\u201d the retailer said in a statement.\n\nWalmart was an early adopter of generative AI. The retailer has incorporated generative AI for its associates to help them answer customer product questions or to help a shopper find a specific item. It also deployed the tech to improve its search, summarize reviews and prioritize product features for customers.\n\nBehind consumer-facing use cases, Walmart also incorporated generative AI for coding assistance. The retailer reports the tech helped save about 4 million developer hours, streamlining deployments and delivering code faster with fewer bugs.\n\nMany other retailers are leaning on generative AI as part of company operations. In a recent earnings call, Target said it used a generative AI tool with social media to catch online trends and boost relevant products faster on its storefront, curating its digital experience.",

            "content": "Tariff pressures are squeezing the retail and eCommerce sectors. What are the two behemoths dominating the space, Walmart and Amazon, doing in response?\n\nThe answer, according to the news this week, is doubling down on technology to enhance operational efficiency and making calculated moves to capture new markets in the face of ongoing uncertainty.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is shaping the future of both companies. Amazon is focusing on customer engagement and automation while Walmart leverages AI for merchant efficiency and product sourcing. Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s privacy changes in its smart device lineup underscore the broader debate surrounding consumer data rights in an AI-driven world.\n\nAt the same time, the companies\u2019 maneuvers into new marketplaces, like Walmart\u2019s deeper expansion into freight services and Amazon\u2019s move into used cars, continue to illustrate the evolving nature of retail.\n\nAs both companies introduce disruptive technologies and services across their respective landscapes, the implications for other businesses and consumers alike are profound.\n\nRead also: The Year in Amazon vs Walmart, and a Look Into 2025\n\nCan Retail Giants Win in the Automotive and Transport Space?\n\nDeepening a commitment made over the summer to expand into freight services, Walmart recently announced a brokerage program to enhance its logistics capabilities and compete more effectively with Amazon.\n\nAccording to a Wednesday (March 19) report, to qualify, carriers must meet requirements including operating over 10 but under 1,000 trucks, maintaining at least five consecutive years of operating authority and carrying $1 million in liability insurance and $100,000 in cargo insurance, among other requirements.\n\nWalmart\u2019s internal infrastructure and private trucking fleet is one of the largest in North America, and the company\u2019s entry into brokerage could establish an attractive ecosystem for third-party sellers and other logistics and fulfilment stakeholders.\n\nAnother intriguing development this week was the reported interest Amazon is showing in the auto market. On Tuesday (March 18), news broke that the eCommerce giant is eyeing helping dealers sell used cars, as well as new ones. If Amazon moves forward with plans to sell used vehicles, it could radically disrupt traditional car dealerships and online platforms such as Carvana. With its extensive logistics network, Amazon could create a streamlined, digital-first car-buying experience that challenges industry norms.\n\nAlso on the car front, Walmart said Wednesday that it will open or remodel more than 45 fuel stations this year. By the end of the year, the retailer will have more than 450 Walmart Fuel and Convenience stations operating across 34 states.\n\nAI Is the Next Competitive Edge for Retailers\n\nArtificial intelligence has become the battleground for corporate supremacy, with both Amazon and Walmart deploying AI to refine their customer service, logistics and business operations.\n\nWalmart on Tuesday debuted a generative AI-powered assistant to help its merchants source items for its shelves and its online store. Dubbed \u201cWally,\u201d the AI assistant generates insights from complex datasets, diagnoses why products are underperforming or overperforming, answers operational questions, raises tickets for unresolved issues and automates complex formulas and predictions, the company said.\n\nAcross consumer and retail companies, 77% of business leaders rank GenAI as the most impactful emerging economy, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence and AI-ID collaboration, \u201cWhat Generative AI Has in Store for the Retail Industry.\u201d\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Amazon announced the next generation of Amazon Connect, launching AI-powered interactions that can help strengthen customer relationships and improve business outcomes.\n\nAmazon also announced that starting March 28, its voice assistant Alexa will process all voice interactions in the cloud to enable new generative AI capabilities, meaning users can no longer prevent their voice recordings from being transmitted to Amazon\u2019s servers.\n\nOn the legal front, Amazon on Monday (March 17) scored a victory with the dismissal of a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of misleading shareholders regarding its pricing and logistics strategies.",

Prosecutors have denied that their efforts violated Crusius\u2019 rights to counsel and a fair trial.\n\nMedrano conducted several days of hearings into the allegations last year, when Bill Hicks was district attorney, but until this week hadn\u2019t scheduled additional hearings after James Montoya took office Jan. 1.\n\nRead More Judge approves order delaying pretrial hearings in Walmart mass shooting case A new motion would have the effect of delaying a trial, which already couldn\u2019t take place before early 2026, by at least several months.\n\nHearings on defense motions are scheduled for April 1, April 21 and April 22.\n\nMontoya also has to decide whether to continue to pursue the death penalty for Crusius, who faces 23 counts of capital murder and 22 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in the Aug. 3, 2019, mass shooting at the Cielo Vista Walmart.\n\nAs a candidate in the 2024 election, Montoya initially said he would pursue the death penalty. But he later said he needed to review evidence in the case before making a final decision.\n\nEPISD to Lose 64 Students Attending Closing Schools\n\nThe El Paso Independent School District expects to lose several dozen students currently attending the six elementary schools set to close by the end of the school year.\n\nSixty-four, or about 6%, of the 1,132 students attending Carlos Rivera, Lamar, Newman, Putnam, Rusk, and Zavala elementary schools will be attending school in a different district next school year, according to priority registration data presented to the EPISD school board Tuesday.\n\nRead More El Paso ISD to close 8 elementary schools amid enrollment declines Following an emotional meeting Tuesday, a sharply divided El Paso ISD school board voted to close eight elementary schools over the next two years in response to declining enrollment and falling birth rates.\n\nAbout 47% (30) of those students say they are leaving the district because they are moving outside of EPISD\u2019s boundaries, 23% (15) said they are moving outside of the city and 20% (13) said they are transferring to a charter school.\n\nThe district also plans to close Stanton and Travis elementary schools in the 2026-27 school year.\n\nEPISD currently has over 48,000 students.\n\nPriority registration for students being affected by the first round of school closures started in January and ended March 31.\n\nRegistration for all other students began April 1.\n\nThe district also expects to lose 28 (10%) of the 273 employees who currently work at schools set to close next school year. This includes teachers, clerical staff and food service workers.\n\nNineteen of the employees leaving the district resigned and the remaining 14 retired.\n\nEPISD offered a $1,500 incentive for employees working in those schools who were already planning to retire to submit an early notification.\n\nEl Paso Electric customers can subscribe to receive power from the utility\u2019s new 10-megawatt solar farm in San Elizario. (Courtesy El Paso Electric)\n\nEl Paso Electric Adds New Solar Farm\n\nEl Paso Electric this week announced the completion of a new 10-megawatt community solar farm in San Elizario that the utility\u2019s customers can subscribe to and receive solar energy from.\n\nSubscribing customers will pay about $15 for every kilowatt of capacity \u2013 meaning one kilowatt worth of production out of the 10 total megawatts the solar field can produce \u2013 that the customer essentially rents out from El Paso Electric. Then, a subscriber would receive a credit on their monthly bill based on how much power their portion of the solar farm produces.\n\nEl Paso Electric sees community solar farms as a way to compete with rooftop solar, which can be costly for individual homeowners and isn\u2019t available for all homeowners or for renters. However, customers who buy and install their own rooftop solar systems own the asset and typically receive a bigger reduction in their monthly power bill than a customer subscribed to community solar.\n\nEl Paso Electric spent $23 million to develop the 70-acre solar farm, which the firm EDF Renewables built. Now that it\u2019s constructed, 5,000 customers will be able to subscribe to solar energy from the site. Customers can submit applications to become subscribers to the community solar farm at epelectric.com/communitysolar.\n\nAnd this solar field in San Elizario is not the only one El Paso Electric is developing. At the end of last year, El Paso Electric asked Texas utility regulators to let it build a $328 million, 100-megawatt solar farm and battery array in far Northeast El Paso, around the utility\u2019s Newman natural gas power plant. That solar farm could start operating during summer 2027.\n\nOne megawatt is enough to power a few hundred homes, depending on the time of day and weather.\n\nEl Paso Electric is also in the process of adding four other major solar farms in and around El Paso \u2013 spanning from Deming, New Mexico, to Fabens, Texas \u2013 totaling 580 megawatts of capacity. El Paso Electric expects all four to start operating sometime in 2026.El Paso Electric has also laid out early plans to develop five other solar and battery facilities by 2029. The utility has said it must add new sources of electricity not only to replace outdated 60-year-old power plant units, but also because El Paso homes and businesses are using far more power than the utility previously expected, largely because of new data centers coming into the city as well as El Pasoans increasingly shifting to power-hungry refrigerated air conditioners. And rising average temperatures here mean a building requires more electricity to stay cool than in the past.\n\nTTHEP Dental School Schedules Free Clinic for Senior Citizens\n\nSenior citizens aged 60 and older can get free dental screenings and cleanings through the Texas Tech Dental Oral Health Clinic from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Fridays, March 21 and 28, at the clinic, 222 Rick Francis St.\n\nThe procedures will be done by dental students at the Texas Tech Health El Paso\u2019s Woody L. Hunt School of Dental Medicine under faculty supervision. The clinics offer students hands-on training on procedures and working with patients.\n\nThe services are provided by appointment only. Participants can schedule their appointments by calling 915-215-6700. Organizers encourage patients to schedule their appointments as soon as possible.\n\nParticipants who qualify can work with clinic representatives to get financial assistance for follow-up services. Much of that assistance will come from the WellMed Charitable Foundation and the Dental Patient Fund, which was created through community donations.\n\nSince it opened four years ago, the clinic has provided 18,000 hours of care to 10,000 patients to include 48% who are age 55 and older.\n\nEvent organizers suggest participants come early to get a good space in the patient parking lot off Rick Francis Street.\n\nWellMed will sponsor these senior clinics. Future senior clinics will be scheduled as funds become available.\n\nFoster School of Medicine Graduates to Participate in Match Day\n\nThe 116 students from Texas Tech Health El Paso\u2019s Paul L. Foster School of Medicine will learn where they will serve as post-graduate residents on Match Day at 10 a.m. Friday, March 21, in the campus\u2019 Medical Sciences Building II auditorium, 137 Rick Francis St.\n\nThese students, to include 15 who grew up in the Paso del Norte region, will spend the next three to seven years at a teaching hospital where they will specialize in their chosen field.\n\nAmong the 15 local students who will open one of the envelopes is Josh Torres, the first person to have graduated from the Foster School of Medicine, the Gayle Greve Hunt School of Nursing and the L. Frederick Francis Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.\n\nTorres, a 2010 graduate of El Paso High School, plans to pursue a residency in internal medicine. If he gets his way, he will serve his residency at TTHEP.\n\nA residency is the foundation of a medical education. It connects theory with practice. The completion of a residency program is needed to earn a medical license. As residents, the TTHEP graduates will work full time to provide direct patient care under the guidance of qualified physicians. They will be given more independence as they develop their clinical skills.\n\nThe history of this celebration dates back to 1952 when the National Resident Matching Program started Match Day. Today, this event involves more than 41,000 medical school graduates from 46 countries and almost 200 medical schools.\n\nLast year, 12 graduates of the Foster Medical School were matched with Texas Tech Health El Paso. They joined another 128 residents from outside the region to work in 15 specialty programs.",

In the years following, Murphy opened over a thousand c-stores near Walmart parking lots.\n\nBut that changed in 2016 when Murphy separated its growth from the big box retailer\u2019s sites, allowing both companies to build their c-store footprints independently. At the time, Murphy said that Walmart would be able to develop its own proprietary gasoline program at its supercenter locations that wouldn\u2019t be supplied or committed to be supplied by Murphy.\n\nFast forward nearly a decade, and Walmart appears to be set on becoming a threat in the c-store industry. Its latest initiative comes just a few months after the company opened its 400th fuel center in December 2024.\n\nWalmart did not disclose where it intends to open and remodel fuel centers amid this c-store push.",

            "content": "Job openings in Alabama are on the rise, especially for nurses, retail workers and truck drivers.\n\nIn 2024, the state\u2019s employers added more than 25,000 jobs, the Alabama Department of Workforce said in an announcement earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThis means that employers remain confident in our job market and are continuing to expand their businesses,\u201d said Greg Reed, Alabama\u2019s secretary of workforce, in a statement.\n\nThe employers who posted the most online job ads in Alabama in January are:\n\nHuntsville Hospital: 1,041 ads UAB Medicine: 799 ads Taco Bell: 736 ads Walmart: 713 ads Jack\u2019s Family Restaurants: 519 ads Domino\u2019s Pizza: 475 ads Baptist Health: 386 ads Circle K: 329 ads Arby\u2019s: 329 ads Walgreens: 327 ads\n\nMore than 82,500 job ads were active online across the state in January \u2013 up nearly 15% from the previous month, according to the most recent data from the Alabama Department of Workforce.\n\nJonathan McNair, public information officer for the workforce department, said one reason for the uptick in job postings is that employers are anticipating seasonal changes as tourism picks up.\n\n\u201cA lot of restaurant and hospitality postings, that\u2019s for spring break and summer seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThose people need to stop at the gas stations, they stop at the fast food places along I-65, and those companies know they\u2019re going to need a lot more employees to handle those folks.\u201d\n\nMcNair also noted population growth in Alabama\u2019s metros, especially Huntsville.\n\n\u201cThat growth comes with the need of more people in drugstores, needing more people in retail stores, needing more people in the restaurants that are needed to serve all these new Alabamians that have come here to join us,\u201d he said.\n\nOther jobs with the most openings in January included fast food and counter workers and food service managers.\n\nNearly 27,500 of those jobs were salaried, according to the workforce department:\n\n29% of them paid $70,000 or more\n\n17% paid between $50,000 and $69,000\n\n26% of them offered pay ranging between $35,000 and $49,000\n\n28% of job ads had salaries below $35,000, according to the state agency.\n\nBut where are the candidates to fill these jobs? During January, the state had nearly 78,300 residents who were unemployed. That\u2019s an unemployment rate of 3.3%, which stayed flat from the previous month and rose from the rate of 2.9% a year earlier.\n\nAlabama\u2019s unemployment rate is lower than the national rate, which was 4% in January.\n\nThe counties with the lowest unemployment rates in January, according to the workforce department, were:\n\nShelby County (2.7%)\n\nElmore, Limestone, Marshall and St. Clair Counties (2.8%)\n\nand Madison, Lee and Morgan Counties at 2.9%.\n\nThree Black Belt counties reported the highest unemployment rates: Greene County (9.1%), Wilcox County (6.9%), and Perry County (6.6%).\n\nAlabama has 57 career centers that work to connect residents with jobs and companies with talent, McNair pointed out.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an employer, and you\u2019re struggling to find employees and your online ads aren\u2019t netting the results that you want, you can also reach out to that local career center,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re able to organize job fairs and they\u2019re in contact with the people that you would need to fill those positions at your company.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s labor force participation rate in January stood at nearly 58%, Reed said. That includes more than three out of four prime-age workers \u2013 those who are 25 to 54 years old.\n\n\u201cWe will continue our efforts to increase this number overall, by increasing training opportunities and targeting populations that have traditionally been marginalized when it comes to labor force participation,\u201d Reed said.",

            "content": "Many grocers and retailers will give away used cardboard boxes to customers. But some big-box stores are a bit stingy when it comes to discarded boxes, as one Walmart employee recently found out.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nIn the r/Walmart subreddit, the employee vented about a frustrating situation at their store when a customer politely asked if they could take some discarded cardboard boxes.\n\n\"Me being the fairly new employee wanted to confirm with somebody else before giving a thumbs up or down,\" they explained in the post. \"Essentially they are waste to us so I doubted that the answer would be NO to that question.\"\n\nHowever, when they asked another worker, they told them it was against store policy to hand them out and shared the information with the customer. The employee felt \"extremely bad\" about turning the customer away and didn't understand why Walmart would waste the boxes rather than give them to someone who needs them.\n\n\"Sounds like you have some funky stuff going on at your store. If a customer asks me or any employee for boxes, the answer is always, 'Help yourself!'\" one Walmart employee explained.\n\n\"We do let customers have boxes. We just direct them to our bakery/deli or meat/produce associates, and they will give them what they have. We stopped that during COVID but started doing it again. So I guess it is up to the store,\" another user shared.\n\nWhile many commenters thought it was strange the store wouldn't give away boxes, others speculated that since Walmart makes money from bales of cardboard, that particular store may not have been keen to lose out on sales.\n\nWhy is business waste concerning?\n\nWhile many big-box stores \u2014 including Walmart \u2014 recycle some cardboard boxes, it's not a universal practice. If they don't get recycled, they will most likely end up in landfills buried under other trash. When microorganisms break it down, they produce methane as a byproduct \u2014 a potent gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to the warming climate.\n\nIf companies throw them away, it wastes the water, trees, energy, and labor required to produce cardboard, and can drive up costs for boxes. However, since Walmart sells used cardboard boxes to customers or recycling centers, it's unlikely the ones at the Reddit user's store were destined for the trash.\n\nIs Walmart doing anything about this?\n\nAs many commenters said, it's up to each particular store to decide what to do with discarded boxes. Some recycle or sell them, and others offer them from specific departments \u2014 such as the bakery or deli \u2014 to customers for free.\n\nAccording to Walmart's website, the company takes waste seriously and aims to divert 90% of its operational waste in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico from landfills by the end of 2025. Regarding cardboard specifically, it recycled 5.8 billion pounds of the material in 2023 and reused more than 85 million breakpack boxes in its U.S. supply chain.\n\nIt also offers Community Recycling Units at select locations, where customers can bring cardboard, aluminum cans, plastic bottles and bags, and other materials for recycling.\n\nWhat else is being done to reduce cardboard waste?\n\nAmazon has partnered with circular packaging companies to reduce shipping waste and switch to more sustainable cardboard boxes. One cafe turned empty cardboard milk cartons into a next-level coffee holder, and a company in the Netherlands built five floating tiny homes out of corrugated cardboard.\n\nYou can also get creative with cardboard at home by laying broken down boxes in your garden to prevent weeds and enrich the soil or using old toilet paper rolls as a nifty way to store loose yarn. It's also important to know the recycling options in your area. If you don't know what to do with extra cardboard, you can never go wrong by recycling it.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

            "content": "This story is part of Modern Retail\u2019s week-long \u201cThe New Supply Chain\u201d series, made up of daily stories on how retail executives are revamping their supply chains to succeed in 2025.\n\nBig-box retailers are laser-focused on making sure that customers know them for fast, reliable delivery.\n\n\u201cIf I could change anything about how we\u2019re perceived today, it\u2019d be that more people know about our breadth of assortment online and our increasing delivery speed,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillion said during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call. Last quarter, Walmart continued to expand its same-day delivery to reach 93% of U.S. households, according to its fourth-quarter earnings release \u2014 a much larger estimate than about a year earlier, when the company had said it reached more than 80% of households. The company also launched same-day pharmacy delivery last year.\n\n\u201cWe aspire to grow same-day delivery to be another unmistakably Target offering that becomes synonymous with the elevated joy, the value and experience that we\u2019re known for,\u201d Cara Sylvester, Target\u2019s evp and chief guest experience officer said during the company\u2019s March 4 earnings call.\n\nFor the biggest retailers in the space, like Target and Walmart, it\u2019s become an arms race to offer the fastest and most convenient same-day delivery options. But even smaller players have realized how crucial improving fulfillment times and offering accurate delivery estimate arrivals are to maintaining customer loyalty. But to get there, retailers are making a myriad of investments. They\u2019re retooling their distribution facilities and stores with automation. They\u2019re investing in tech to get more granular insight into their inventory levels. And, overall, they\u2019re figuring out what they need to build a reliable delivery network.\n\nTech upgrades boost both speed and accuracy\n\nMelissa Minkow, global director of retail strategy for information technology company CI&T, said data management, demand forecasting and analytics capabilities are critical investments for retailers so they can improve forecasting in their supply chains and not overallocate to certain stores, thus improving speed and economics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about literal distribution,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about getting the data accurate enough so that you\u2019re not ending up with stock-outs or excess inventory.\u201d\n\nWalmart has been building five new high-tech fulfillment centers since 2021, the company said last year \u2014 some have since opened. It\u2019s also expanded existing distribution centers, by adding 500,000-plus square feet of automation per site to increase capacity for fresh products, and retrofitted another facility in Florida with robotics. In addition, the company rolled out a new platform to better manage its delivery data last year, Fast Company reported.\n\nAdditionally, this year, the company announced artificial intelligence and robotics firm Symbotic would develop and improve systems to accelerate pickup and delivery options at Walmart stores, a $520 million investment for the retailer.\n\nThis month, Target also said it is updating or expanding its supply chain network to move inventory with more speed, accuracy and efficiency.\n\n\u201cThat includes modernizing the company\u2019s core inventory management system with AI-powered technology solutions that will improve reliability and reduce out-of-stocks,\u201d the company wrote in a news release. \u201cThe company is also implementing several new package delivery solutions, leveraging existing stores and supply chain assets and its Shipt capability, to further improve delivery speed to consumers.\u201d\n\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods president Lauren Hobart said on an earnings call in March that the retailer is expanding the use of RFID in the store to further improve fulfillment speeds to make delivery speedier and more efficient. And Advance Auto Parts implemented services from last-mile delivery firm OneRail and IBM to have a real-time view of its inventory of 2 million auto parts, according to a post this month from IBM. As a result, the repair shops saw a 12% reduction in transportation costs and a 27% sales increase for its 30-minute delivery segment, according to IBM.\n\nDown-to-the-minute delivery estimates\n\nSpecialty retailers may have different goals for their supply chains, such as communicating more accurate delivery times to customers or quoting precise delivery dates instead of a range of dates.\n\nFor example, Etsy said last year it began offering more precise delivery dates to shoppers after launching a new machine learning model. And Best Buy has been rolling out delivery tracking system for minute-by-minute updates.\n\n\u201cWe know our customers\u2019 time is extremely valuable, and we\u2019re proud to bring a level of convenience to technology delivery and installation that nobody is currently providing,\u201d Best Buy\u2019s chief digital, analytics and technology officer, Brian Tilzer, said in a statement last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something of a Holy Grail to be able to deliver that level of accuracy to consumers,\u201d said Tom Enright, a retail supply chain analyst for Gartner, adding that it may actually be less complex for smaller retailers as they have fewer distribution centers and stores and, thus, fewer complications in figuring out where to ship items from. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of taking care of the things they control and then working with the right [shipping] provider so that they can do their part of the bargain.\u201c\n\nStill, Enright cautioned that implementation of software for precise delivery estimates can take time and supply chain software vendors can take up to a year to roll out applications.\n\nDifferent strokes for different retailers\n\nBut just because the largest retailers are boosting same-day delivery doesn\u2019t mean every retailer wants it or should implement it. And for retailers that don\u2019t want to build out their own same-day delivery of network, there are plenty of other delivery startups like DoorDash and UberEats that work with a wide variety of retail partners, ranging from CVS to Sephora to The Vitamin Shoppe to Lowe\u2019s.\n\nMinkow said some retailers may wish more for certainty in pricing and delivery speeds, especially in a more uncertain economic environment. Even in grocery, where it makes more sense to deliver products within an hour, Minkow admits customers likely will drive to the store within that timeframe.\n\n\u201cA company like Walmart, for example, they have some inherent scalability baked in because the demand is there, just given how many shoppers they have every day,\u201d Minkow said. \u201cSmaller chains are not necessarily going to see the demand to make the payoff worth it.\u201d\n\nGartner\u2019s Enright said that three to five years ago, more retailers had been trying to race to keep up with Amazon. Since then, he said, they have found that customers actually don\u2019t mind: 70% of e-commerce spending comes from people who wait more than three days for shipping, according to the firm.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said in its earnings call Feb. 20 that more than 30% of its orders came from customers who paid a convenience fee to receive their deliveries in less than one hour or less than three hours.\n\nThe share of customers paying for Walmart\u2019s less-than-three-hour delivery may be growing, but 30% is still a minority, and ultra-fast fulfillment is more relevant to Walmart as it stocks grocery items and produce. Timeliness is more of a concern with those products than with general merchandise; food may be perishable, and customers may have last-minute grocery needs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no problem at all in not being able to deliver to every corner of the U.S. the same day because you\u2019re not going to have a huge amount of demand for it to happen anyway \u2014 three to seven [days] is the average we\u2019ve seen most companies offer,\u201d Enright said. \u201cConsumers just don\u2019t see the urgency in the vast majority of cases.\u201d",

The first of the new locations opened earlier this year, with more planned throughout 2025.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not the only big-box or grocery chain to prioritize a convenience store arm of the company in the last few years.\n\nH-E-B, for instance, operates a c-store concept that it rebranded to H-E-B Fresh Bites in 2023. Many of these include True Texas Tacos. H-E-B Fresh Bites features fresh produce, salads, sandwiches and sushi made daily; meat and cheese snacks; juices; kombucha; and Meal Simple options. Customers can also opt for H-E-B Select Ingredients items in addition to normal convenience offerings such as fountain, beer and wine, and other snacks.\n\n\u201cAt H-E-B, we\u2019re always looking to provide Texans convenient ways to get their hands on quality, fresh foods that are good for them,\u201d said Scott Campbell, H-E-B convenience store operations manager, in a press release. \u201cWith the introduction of H-E-B Fresh Bites, we\u2019re bringing the freshest products to our customers who are on the go but want a better alternative to traditional convenience store snacks.\u201d\n\nPresently, to better serve its loyal customers, Walmart is investing in its expansive physical store presence. Currently, Walmart operates 400-plus Fuel and Convenience stations nationwide. With the openings this year, the retailer will have more than 450 locations across 34 states.\n\nThe first Walmart Fuel and Convenience station opened in 2002.\n\nThese one-stop shops not only offer low prices at their pumps, but Walmart Fuel and Convenience stations offer the same low prices on snacks and beverages as what\u2019s offered inside the Walmart store. Customers and Walmart+ members can shop the Fuel and Convenience stations, and Walmart+ members save up to 10 cents per gallon with their membership.\n\nA few of the locations offer self-checkout inside the station. Tobacco and lottery are available at locations where it is in keeping with local regulations.\n\nThis expansion allows Walmart to continue to provide a convenient shopping experience with a focus on accessibility and ease.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to invest in our nationwide, physical store footprint. By adding dozens of fuel and convenience stations this year, we are bringing even more value to our customers,\u201d said Dave DeSerio, VP of Fuel and Convenience, Walmart U.S. \u201cCustomers shop Walmart for our everyday low prices and convenience offerings, and fuel stations are another example of us responding to our customer and member needs.\u201d\n\nAlthough many convenience store chains operate brands aside from their primary c-store offering, the convenience operations from these larger retailers have and will likely continue to play a large role in future mergers and acquisitions (M&A) moves.\n\nHy-Vee, for instance, operates Hy-Vee Fast & Fresh, an expansive 180-store convenience chain located in eight Midwestern states. Fast & Fresh includes Market Grille Express, a foodservice concept that offers freshly made breakfast sandwiches, burgers, sides and appetizers. It also offers fresh baked goods, fountain, ICEE, freshly brewed tea and more. Customers can save with a Hy-Vee PERKS card.\n\nNot every retailer chooses to enter the c-store business, however. Back in 2013, Publix decided to sell its c-stores, known as PIX. Kroger, too, sold its c-store business, which comprised hundreds of sites, to EG Group for over $2 billion in 2018. It had begun new c-store format Fresh Eats MKT in 2017, which it discontinued in 2020.\n\nAs the M&A market continues to shift and make headlines, the industry will soon see how the convenience store businesses of these larger retailers further make waves.",

Now, it has 80-plus brands and more than 2,500 items in stock for premium beauty.\n\nVinima Shekhar\n\n\u201cCustomers have been loving the addition of premium beauty to Walmart since we first launched our initial assortment a few years ago,\u201d said Shekhar, who was promoted to the role last year, succeeding Creighton Kiper. He was promoted to senior vice president of the retailer\u2019s home business.\n\n\u201cThrough Walmart\u2019s marketplace we\u2019re able to introduce new and exciting brands, including CosRx, T3 and Beachwaver. Since the launch last summer, premium brands such as L\u2019ange & Victoria\u2019s Secret have seen double-digit growth post-launch, with T3 hitting triple digit growth,\u201d she said.\n\nLaunches this month include La Roche Posay skin care, Buxom\u2019s line of lip products like glosses, Tizo skin care and FHI Heat hot hair tools and accessories.\n\nLa Roche Posay\n\nMore retailers are leaning into marketplace models. Ulta Beauty recently revealed that it will be launching an invite-only marketplace later this year. Amazon, meanwhile, continues to push deeper into the prestige beauty market.\n\nAway from the marketplace, Walmart continues to bring in more beauty in-store amid a competitive landscape.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve launched over 60 new brands in the past year, including noteworthy beauty favorites, like Pretty Smart, Being and Curology, with many still to come that will be part of the premium beauty program,\u201d said Shekhar.\n\nWalmart\u2019s strategy also includes a shop-in-shop partnership with Space NK to bring prestige beauty to its aisles, including a co-incubated brand called BeautySpace. Space NK\u2019s U.S. wholesale division was acquired by the PCA Companies for an undisclosed sum.\n\nAs for what shoppers have been interested in, Shekhar said it is in line with industry trends.\n\n\u201cSkin health, and skin in general, continues to be a category that has been growing, and we see that we win really well in the hair care business, both from the premium side as well as the everyday essentials,\u201d she added. \u201cWe continue to see that fragrance is having a moment and Walmart is winning in fragrance.\u201d\n\nNails are also big business. \u201cIf you layer on kind of what\u2019s happening in the economy, a lot of customers are having to make some tough choices. And so going to the salons is something that they\u2019re rethinking, but they want to have the nails. Nails is a new form of self expression, and instead of having to wait three weeks to go into a salon, you can pay half the price and get new nails every week. And so that continues to be an area that is growing for us.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Walmart Start is welcoming its third cohort.\n\nThis year\u2019s group includes Maison 276, a hair care system for silver and blond hair, founded by Angel Cornelius; Nappy Styles, a natural hair brand using ingredients like shea butter, black castor oil and coconut oil; Lattafa, an Arabian-inspired fragrance brand, and Kativa, a hair care line.\n\nLattafa\n\nThe brands will be available on Walmart.com and in select Walmart stores starting this week. Brands chosen to be part of Walmart Start will receive access to resources such as education, mentorship and brand activation.\n\n\u201cFor us, we want to work with suppliers large and small. This is really a great white glove service at Walmart, started three years ago, and we continue to lean in and invest,\u201d said Shekhar.\n\n\u201cThe largest retailer can sometimes be intimidating and requires a lot of investment and a lot of expertise. What we do is we actually provide them more favorable terms, we hand-hold them and help them understand how to set up their items, how to manage their inventory, how to manage their supply chain work, and also just to make sure that they understand how to actually drive sales, whether it\u2019s online or on shelf,\u201d the executive added.\n\nThere\u2019s no timeline for how long they will be available at Walmart. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is actually all the Walmart Start brands that we\u2019ve onboarded continue to grow and continue to be successful. Our hope is, as we bring on these brands, not only are they meeting a customer need and helping us grow our business, but it\u2019s also helping these smaller suppliers grow their business and help them be more successful,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the three months ended Jan. 31, the retailer reported revenues of $180.6 billion, up 4.1 percent from $175.4 billion in the year-ago period. Groceries saw midsingle-digit growth and health and wellness grew in the mid-teens. General merchandise generated low-single-digit growth, with hardlines, toys, home and fashion the best-performing categories.",

            "content": "This commentary is by Jarrod Weiss. He is a transplant to Vermont from Ohio with a background in education, government and public policy. He lives with his wife and four young kids in Calais.\n\nIn 1995, Vermont became the 50th state in the United States to welcome Walmart begrudgingly, along with its \u201cGreat Value\u201d brand, to the Green Mountain State. A land known for small-town charm and local general stores was then and forever forced to compete in the marketplace of low-cost products and underappreciated labor. Thirty years, and six Walmarts, later, Vermonters are now faced with a fancy new big box concept to contend with: \u201ceducation reform.\u201d\n\nGov. Phil Scott and the Agency of Education recently announced their big, bold and misguided education reform plan which will upend the education system in Vermont as we know it. A state known for small schools, responsive teaching and community-mindedness has apparently become too much of a hassle.\n\nInstead of true innovative reform, we get a proposed Walmart-ization of education in our state. The plan presented to the Legislature was simply the big box version of standardized and consolidated education, something most Vermonters have rejected in other parts of life.\n\nVermont is known for local, independent small businesses, shops, co-ops and restaurants, and most of us will do what we can to avoid the big box stores, even if it costs more. We do that out of an appreciation for what local businesses mean to our communities and supporting those businesses is supporting our neighbors and friends.\n\nAs of today, Vermont has only six Walmarts and this plan would create five school districts. We would have more Walmarts than school districts. The entire appeal of Vermont to focus on small, local communities and schools will be lost.\n\nUnlike what Gov. Scott has said, those of us who are highly skeptical of this plan are not \u201cfearful\u201d of change. In fact, many of us recognize there are serious deficiencies in our system and now is the time to act. However, just because we don\u2019t like the plan he presented doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t seek change.\n\nIn fact, the opposite is true. Change is what many of us have been calling for, loudly, for years, especially since the pandemic. That change needs to be thoughtful and carefully crafted and truly innovative and creative \u2014 a new system that takes full advantage of all we have to offer as a state.\n\nWhat we are \u201cfearful\u201d of is the Walmart-ization of our education system. We don\u2019t want \u201cbig box\u201d education, we want to do education the Vermont way and do it right. Changes are needed, and some big changes, to create that unique, innovative and successful education system that our kids deserve, but we want it done right. This plan is no \u201cGreat Value\u201d and our state deserves a better approach.\n\nThe cost of education is too high. Some schools are probably too small. There are redundancies in the system that make delivery inefficient. These things are true. However, we have smart, dedicated and amazing people in this state who can stand up and deliver what is needed to make the education system work. We can face those challenges and change what education looks like in a way that truly works for all Vermonters.\n\nIt\u2019s cliche, but the education of our children is truly the linchpin of our future. As a state with an aging population, a housing affordability crisis and a desperate need for job growth, an innovative and thriving education system is the most important step toward a sustainable future for all of Vermont.\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit, as a father of four kids under the age of 13, sometimes we just have to go to Walmart. There are times when I look at my wife and say, \u201cDo we really have to go to Walmart?\u201d Yet, when it comes to the education of our children, my own or the 82,000 plus in the state, I don\u2019t want us to think the only solution is the Walmart-ization of our schools.\n\nThis education reform plan, as written, is just not the \u201cGreat Value\u201d Vermont needs or desires.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Swedish buy now, pay later company Klarna Group will unseat Affirm Holdings as the exclusive provider of installment loans at Walmart, Klarna announced Monday.\n\nThose installment loans will be offered through OnePay, a digital payments app that Walmart shoppers can use at checkout online and in the store, Klarna said in a news release. OnePay is a service provided by One, the fintech established by Walmart and venture capital firm Ribbit Capital in 2021 that is majority owned by the retailer.\n\nAffirm first partnered with Walmart in 2019.\n\nThe change will be made gradually, a Klarna spokesperson said in an email. OnePay will start integrating Klarna installment loan options into Walmart\u2019s checkout in the coming weeks and those options \u201cwill be scaled to all Walmart channels by the holiday season,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nKlarna products available to Walmart customers include loans ranging from three months to 36 months, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe move gives Klarna access to a Walmart customer base that spends hundreds of billions of dollars every year. Walmart is the largest retailer in the United States, based on 2023 sales according to the National Retail Federation. Walmart reported $681 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ended on Jan. 31, according to an earnings report.\n\n\u201cWe will continue our long-term strategy of competing on our products and entering into sustainable partnerships,\u201d an Affirm spokesperson said in an emailed statement that did not address the Walmart news.\n\nAffirm installment loans are still available as an option at Walmart\u2019s checkout at this point, the company said in an SEC filing Monday. The BNPL provider noted that sales through Walmart were about 5% of its gross merchandise volume for the second half of last year. They also represented about 2% of its adjusted operating income.\n\n\u201cAlthough the loss of a significant retail partner, especially one as important as Walmart, is impossible to spin positively, in our opinion, there is a key reason why Klarna\u2019s reported contract is not one that Affirm would favor,\u201d William Blair analysts wrote in a note to investors Monday.\n\nAffirm prefers to control the user experience, and would not have wanted to cede control over that experience to OnePay, the analysts wrote.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWalmart is making room for another restaurant chain inside its stores. Nozzleman Pizza Co. announced Tuesday it opened inside its first Walmart location in Carson City, Nevada.\n\nThe quick-service restaurant chain said it plans to open 17 locations inside the retailer across six states this year.\n\nThe partnership builds on Walmart\u2019s growing roster of in-store restaurants as the retailer looks to boost in-store revenue and expand its meal options for consumers.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs grocers and retailers look to compete with restaurants for shoppers\u2019 dining dollars, Walmart has brought quick-service restaurants to its customers.\n\nAlong with the newly opened in-store restaurant in Carson City, Nozzleman Pizza plans to debut in several more Walmart stores in northern Nevada, including in the communities of Gardnerville, Fallon and Reno by late summer. The chain expects further expansion of the partnership to include Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Wyoming and Utah, with nationwide expansion as the long-term goal.\n\nThe Nozzleman Pizza inside the Carson City Walmart is the only location currently listed on the pizza chain\u2019s website.\n\nNozzleman Pizza\u2019s menu includes 16-inch pies, pizza by the slice, garlic cheese bread, fries, chicken tenders, Caesar salad, grilled cheese sandwiches, soft-serve ice cream and drinks.\n\n\u201cWith Walmart locations, our franchisees have the potential to tap into high-foot-traffic stores with a very loyal customer base helping to ensure financial stability,\u201d Nozzleman Pizza co-founder Robert Powells said in the announcement.\n\nFounded in Reno, Nozzleman Pizza gets its name from co-founder Jesse Corletto, a retired firefighter who wanted to honor first responders, the announcement noted. Each Nozzleman Pizza location donates a portion of its proceeds to local fire stations.\n\nWalmart has partnered with several in-store quick-service restaurants, bringing hoagies, hot dogs and poke to several of its locations. Last summer, Walmart linked with Mr Gatti\u2019s Pizza and announced plans to open 92 corporate-owned units inside stores across four states. Wetzel\u2019s Pretzels has also opened units inside Walmart stores.\n\nWalmart\u2019s emphasis on food comes as it continues to gain market share in grocery. Walmart U.S.\u2019s grocery segment saw mid-single-digit growth and remains a \u201cstandout category\u201d for the retailer, Walmart CFO John David Rainey told investors last month.",

The nonprofit will mark its 30th anniversary this year amid rising youth mentorship demand.\n\nThe organization will host multiple events this year for the anniversary. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and Kieran Shanahan, chief operating officer for Walmart U.S., will participate in a fireside chat in April. The guest speaker will be Artis Stevens, president and CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. About 400 attendees are expected for the event from 10 a.m. to noon April 30 at Rogers Convention Center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be celebrating the whole year, and then we\u2019re going to be honoring some of the founders and some of our first matches at our gala in September of this year,\u201d CEO Lance Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said the organization was founded in 1993, but the founders spent two years raising money and preparing to serve youth. The organization considers this year its 30th anniversary because the first match between a child and a mentor was made in December 1995.\n\nBig Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest Arkansas is one of about 230 affiliates of Tampa, Fla.-based Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and operates as a nonprofit governed by a board of directors. The 16-member board oversees nine full-time and three part-time employees and about 400 volunteers.\n\nThe organization works with area schools and families to support youth facing adversity through one-to-one mentoring. Mentors are area volunteers who are vetted by staff. The youth comprise children ages 6 to 18 in Benton and Washington counties, and about 60% are teenagers.\n\nThe organization\u2019s recent growth was recognized nationally in 2024 when it received the Growth Award from Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. In 2024, the organization logged 7,280 hours of mentorship, and the total number of youth served rose to 433. Johnson said the vision is to scale at the pace of Northwest Arkansas\u2019 growth. It plans to increase the number of youth served by 10% this year. About 40 youth are on a waiting list.\n\n\u201cSchools are where we get most of our referrals,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at kids who are struggling academically, youth who are experiencing bullying \u2026 Those types of needs can be served by what we call our lunch buddy program. The idea is we\u2019re putting a volunteer going in during lunch and recess when the kids don\u2019t have as close of communication with the teacher. They\u2019re more vulnerable during that time period, especially if they\u2019re being bullied \u2026 Now, this kid becomes a little bit more popular because they have a special visitor that comes every week.\u201d\n\nFor children struggling academically, mentors can help with schoolwork during lunch.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of our slogan right now is it takes little to be big.\u201d\n\nFUNDRASING EVENTS\n\nJohnson said this is the first year the nonprofit\u2019s budget has exceeded $1 million. Most of its funding is raised in the area, primarily through corporate-sponsored events. The national office provides a small federal grant for serving at-risk youth and youth in the juvenile justice system. The nonprofit serves 15 youth annually with the grant.\n\nThe April event is one of eight fundraisers this year and will kick off with mentors sharing their volunteer experiences. Admission is $200 and includes breakfast. More information is available online at givebutter.com/dougmcmillon.\n\n\u201cWe recently reconnected with one of our very first matches,\u201d he said. \u201cThey live in Benton County, and so we\u2019re going to be trying to engage them this year and sharing their story. They were matched 30 years ago this year, and they still are connected very closely.\u201d\n\nJohnson became involved with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest Arkansas in 2005 as a student at the University of Arkansas. He was a mentor, or big, to a young boy who still resides in Northwest Arkansas. He mentored the boy for about three years and remains in touch with him via social media.\n\nAfter graduation, Johnson spent about five years working with child abuse victims under the age of 5 in a preschool setting. Then, he joined the leadership team of Head Start in Washington County. He was director of children\u2019s services, overseeing nine preschools in Washington County and a home-visiting program for Benton, Carroll, Madison and Washington counties.\n\nHe joined Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest as CEO in May 2022.\n\n\u201cI wanted experience working with a different age group,\u201d he said. \u201cEarly childhood is tough work. I was in that for about 15 years.\u201d\n\nPROGRAM CHANGES\n\nThe organization has changed since Johnson started volunteering in 2005. Initially, it offered one-to-one mentoring to the youth and adult volunteers, but it has since expanded to include the youth and couples or families who are mentors.\n\nJoseph Obiri, who leads the Nestle USA team as global vice president for its Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club businesses, has been board president of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest Arkansas since late 2022. He joined the board in early 2021. Obiri and his family volunteer as mentors to a 7-year-old youth. He said he previously mentored youth as a big in several cities, including Fayetteville.\n\n\u201cI know how lucky I am to have grown up with a village around me that helped guide me and show me what was possible, and I know the support BBBSNWA provides helps guide kids like me, gives support to their caretakers and eventually helps increase the number of productive members of our community,\u201d Obiri said. \u201cThere are countless stories of former littles in the area who now are our communities\u2019 college students, teachers or work to support civil services in our growing community.\u201d\n\nJohnson said the organization recently relocated to 97 W. Colt Square Drive in Fayetteville, and the new space will allow for group mentoring. The nationwide trend is that the number of boys signing up exceeds the number of adult men signing up to serve as mentors. Group mentoring can help to close the gap.\n\nHe said the organization piloted group mentoring last year, with three men mentoring about 12 boys. He said it will be more focused this year and expanded to Benton County.\n\nThe organization also looks to double the capacity of its high school leadership program, a new partnership with Fayetteville High School. It includes high school juniors and seniors who mentor elementary students. It serves 50 students, up from 25 in the previous school year. This fall, he hopes to see it rise to 100 students. The program has 45 high school students serving as mentors to students in four elementary schools in Fayetteville. Johnson said the program may be expanded to Benton County schools.\n\nAnother new program is the Beyond School Walls program, which launched in 2023 at Rogers Heritage High School after a successful pilot the previous year. Johnson said the first class to participate in the mentorship program will graduate this May. The program includes mentors and youth who discuss career aspirations, set goals, provide guidance and take field trips to offices of area companies, primarily in the retail sector.\n\nMATCH MAKING\n\nTo participate in Big Brothers Big Sisters, families and volunteers undergo an application and interview process before youth are matched with an adult mentor. They are matched based on past experiences, interests and location. Johnson said mentors are asked to spend \u201ca couple hours a month\u201d with the youth. The average length for a match between mentors and youth is 25 months.\n\nJohnson said the organization offers youth facing adversity \u201ca positive role model. It\u2019s just really nice to know that we\u2019re providing the child with that person that\u2019s not their family or their counselor at school that they can open up to and start to form a friendship with.\u201d\n\nMiriam Gonzalez, match support lead at Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwest Arkansas, said she supervises three match support specialists who create and support matches. She also oversees program participants and communicates with them. She joined the organization in June 2021 and became a big two years ago.\n\n\u201cWe are here for the community; even through a pandemic, we still supported matches,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cJust seeing the growth that has happened even in the four years that I have been here is very significant. I think that it makes this 30th anniversary a little more special.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 16 Stocks?. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago during his show on March 18, 2024.\n\nOn the most recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised his viewers against exiting the market entirely, despite the sharp sell-off. He also reminded viewers that, historically, the market has always found its bottom, and stocks can rebound over time. Cramer then addressed the idea of selling everything but he raised an important question saying:\n\n\u201cSure you can get out, but can you get back in? Selling everything right now feels great. We know that President Trump is now hanging with the bears\u2026 As he himself said you can\u2019t really watch the stock market, the stock market\u2019s the problems of the rich, and they don\u2019t matter as long as it, they can take a hit. And that\u2019s a zeitgeist from the Walmart White House where Trump\u2019s giving us everyday lower prices for stocks.\u201d\n\nCramer then pointed out the disparity between President Trump\u2019s approach and what long-term investors might believe is the right course of action. In the past, Cramer noted, figures like Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell were seen as stabilizers, or \u201cputs,\u201d that would help cushion the market\u2019s downward moves. However, no one seems to be talking about that kind of support lately. He added:\n\n\u201cPeople are capitulating because they want to get rid of the pain and they don\u2019t want to lose the game\u2026 See, there\u2019s just one problem. How do you get back in?\u201d\n\nCramer also highlighted a common pitfall: many investors get scared off during market downturns and fail to seize the opportunity to buy strong companies at lower prices. He pointed out that this fear leads people to miss out on significant future gains, leaving them on the sidelines while others take advantage of lower stock prices and reap substantial rewards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why you should be thinking of buying the great companies here, not selling them. To not get good merchandise as it starts being really cheap is a failure of imagination, to not have held them all the way could be a failure of recognition.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 16 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on March 18, 2024. We then calculated their performance from March 18th, 2024, market close to March 7th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nNote: This article covers Jim Cramer\u2019s commentary from March 18, 2024, and does not account for any changes in his opinions regarding the stocks mentioned. Therefore, the commentary should not be mistaken for his latest opinions on any of the stocks that are mentioned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 116\n\nCramer was very bullish on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), calling it a \u201cjuggernaut\u201d with exceptional management. He praised CEO Doug McMillon, highlighting Walmart\u2019s ability to consistently outperform in retail:\n\n\u201cYou know something? It is hard to find a bad time to buy Walmart. This stock is just a juggernaut. Management there is so good. Doug McMillon is so good.\u201d\n\nThe company has indeed been doing amazing over the past year and that\u2019s reflected in the stock price which is up 50.35%.\n\nHere is what Cramer said about Walmart in a Mad Money episode which aired on the 25th of February:\n\n\u201cAlthough Walmart has a degree of wealthier people going there. . . They\u2019re getting that, the amount of how much people make of Walmart\u2019s going up. This is an important bedrock. You can\u2019t use it as a bank.

            "content": "Mark your calendar for earnings reports. For Amazon it\u2019s April 29. For Walmart it\u2019s May 15.\n\nIf you have any stake or interest in the fortunes of the American consumer, those dates will be ones to watch, because as the first quarter draws to a close, Amazon and Walmart are bracing for what could be a challenging earnings season.\n\nBoth companies, bellwethers of consumer spending, have expressed caution about their Q1 prospects due to persistent inflation, weak consumer demand and foreign exchange challenges. This cautious outlook reflects broader concerns about the health of the global economy and its impact on consumer behavior.\n\nThey are, of course, not alone in the attention those earnings will receive. Other companies will step up with their own take on consumer spending, but it is expected to be down, maybe even significantly.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, \u201cCiti\u2019s analysis of its U.S. credit-card data shows that spending has fallen across most retail categories. In the retail quarter to date, spending plunged 12% and 22% on apparel and athletic footwear, respectively, compared with a year earlier. But even less-discretionary categories such as food retail, aftermarket auto parts and pet retail are seeing moderate declines.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, consumers have been prioritizing essential purchases over discretionary items, a trend exacerbated by high inflation. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted this shift during a March 10 speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, stating, \u201cThere are lots of income levels in this country \u2014 if you\u2019re at the lower end of that scale, you are feeling more frustration and pain because of higher food prices. They\u2019ve persisted for years now, and you\u2019re just tired of it.\u201d\n\nMcMillon also highlighted that budget-conscious consumers are buying smaller pack sizes and being more selective with their purchases. But there are other issues. According to a March 7 article from Zachs, \u201cWalmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company\u2019s implied fourth-quarter view [Q1 by the calendar] for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Amazon has faced challenges in maintaining its sales momentum. The company\u2019s projected revenue for Q1 2025 was below expectations, ranging from $151 billion to $155.5 billion, reflecting concerns about inflation and consumer spending.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData, observed, \u201cUncertainty seems to be the buzzword of earnings calls. \u2026 Going into this year, a lot of retailers are very nervous about various aspects of policy, particularly tariffs. They fear both the cost implications for their businesses and the dampening impact higher prices would have on spending.\u201d\n\nImpact of Tariffs and Inflation\n\nTariffs have been another significant factor affecting both retailers. Walmart, as the largest U.S. importer of containerized goods, is particularly vulnerable to tariffs on discretionary items like clothing and electronics, which are primarily sourced from countries such as China and India.\n\nBrian Mulberry, a portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, noted that more than 70% of Walmart\u2019s Great Value brand products come from China, making the company sensitive to tariff fluctuations.\n\nInflation continues to pressure consumer budgets, leading to a focus on value-driven purchases. Jeanel Alvarado, founder and CEO of RetailBoss, explained, \u201cConsumers feel the pinch of inflation, shifting their focus to essentials like groceries and health products while cutting back on discretionary items like apparel and electronics.\u201d\n\nDespite these challenges, both companies have shown resilience. Amazon recently surpassed Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time, with $187.8 billion in sales compared to Walmart\u2019s $180.5 billion. However, Walmart\u2019s annual sales still outpace Amazon\u2019s, with projections indicating Walmart will generate approximately $708.7 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, while Amazon is expected to reach about $700.8 billion.\n\nWalmart\u2019s stock has faced volatility following its mixed Q4 earnings report, with shares dropping after the company provided softer-than-expected guidance for Q1 2025 and beyond. Despite this, Walmart\u2019s business fundamentals remain strong, with eCommerce sales surging and the company attracting higher-income shoppers.\n\nAs Amazon and Walmart prepare to report their Q1 2025 earnings, the retail landscape is marked by caution. Consumer spending trends suggest a continued focus on essentials and value-driven purchases, influenced by inflation and tariff concerns.\n\nWhile both companies face challenges, their adaptability and strategic shifts in response to consumer behavior will be crucial in navigating these headwinds. As Saunders noted, \u201cThere is genuine concern that demand could soften in a material way,\u201d underscoring the need for retailers to remain agile in an uncertain economic environment.",

Although Dollar General suggested it was \u201cwell-positioned\u201d to deal with the ongoing tariffs, it nevertheless raised prices in response.\n\nDollar General Isn\u2019t Alone: Walmart Is Also Signaling a Strained US Consumer\n\nDollar General was joined by Walmart in issuing a serious warning about the overall health of the U.S. consumer, particularly those earning less money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can see that the money runs out before the month is gone,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told the Economic Club of Chicago weeks ago, per Axios.\n\n\u201cYou can see that people are buying smaller pack sizes at the end of the month,\u201d he continued.\n\nCiting Circana data, Axios noted that convenience stores were also seeing a downward incline in terms of sales, tumbling 4.3% for the year ended February.\n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t afford it anymore,\u201d sales representative David Guerino told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a necessity, they\u2019re not as willing to splurge.\u201d\n\nAxios closed out a roundup of the issue by suggesting that analysts and onlookers keep an eye on stock trends and tariff news, as a declining stock market \u2014 or further tariffs \u2014 could exacerbate the issue further.",

We paced the tile floors, squinted under fluorescent lights, smelled the bread wafting in from the Subway in the foyer. We strolled up and down the aisles, passing unloaded palettes and abandoned carts. But we weren\u2019t there for groceries. We were there to ask shoppers how we could pray for them.\n\nOur method was simple: Identify a shopper, approach that person slowly, and introduce yourself. Be warm, concise. State your purpose. Hi! My name is Heidie, and this is my friend Leah. We\u2019re Christians, and we were wondering if there was any way we could pray for you today. Then we would smile and wait until the person we were speaking to no longer looked startled.\n\nMany people said no thank you and hurried away, the way one does when cornered by a Girl Scout during cookie season. Some ignored us, continuing to reach for canned goods and check items off their lists. Some responded with open derision, emitting unfriendly grunts or mumbling things like you fundamentalists. But occasionally, a person would say sure, we\u2019d inquire what about, and then we\u2019d start to pray.\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nOur prayer offer was genuine, though perhaps a sort of front. What we really wanted was to evangelize. We wanted to present the gospel message beginning to end, creation to consummation, and invite people to respond. So we prayed informative prayers. We situated requests inside the story of biblical history, defining terms and quoting Scripture along the way. The social conventions surrounding prayer\u2014namely, that you remain buckled in until someone says amen\u2014made our presentations possible.\n\nThis was the evangelistic strategy we\u2019d learned from students earning their master of divinity at our devout Baptist college. The MDiv students took a course titled Introduction to Evangelism, so our campus had a constant supply of pastors-in-training looking to lead outings and confer tips. If all you can do is pray for someone, I heard many MDiv students explain, then pray the gospel. So we did. I prayed the gospel in the produce aisle of a superstore. My friend Zoe opted for the coffee shops in \u201cHippie Village.\u201d My friend Andrew preferred a nearby mall. My roommate, Alina, visited public universities.\n\nThe MDiv students weren\u2019t driving our school\u2019s emphasis on evangelism\u2014more so responding to it. In our daily campus-wide chapel services, speakers regularly preached that all Christians are called to live on mission and that we are in a cosmic battle for souls. My group\u2019s Walmart outreach may have been a caricature of these principles\u2014something I credit to the clumsiness of freshman fervor\u2014but we were working from our chaplains\u2019 exhortations. Tell the story. Name the stakes. Make clear the route to salvation.\n\nSure, we\u2019d get backlash. But the gospel was offensive to nonbelievers. A \u201cstumbling block,\u201d in Paul\u2019s words (1 Cor. 1:23). Backlash was to be expected. Our job was to \u201cshake the dust off [our] feet\u201d and carry on (Matt. 10:14). One chapel speaker quoted Charles Spurgeon on the subject. \u201cIf sinners be damned,\u201d Spurgeon had written, \u201cat least let them leap to hell over our dead bodies.\u201d The speaker enunciated hard on dead bodies. Harrowed amens echoed from our chapel audience.\n\nMy Walmart evangelism faded midway through my sophomore year, when most of the MDiv students I knew had finished Introduction to Evangelism and moved on to Biblical Greek. Quiet Friday evenings gave me an opportunity to take stock. I was glad to have an answer when chapel speakers asked the room, How are you responding to the Great Commission? I was grateful, also, for my hardened spiritual calluses, for the dying to self I\u2019d experienced in the face of derision and side-eyes.\n\nMy efforts had come from an earnest place. One of the most common encouragements my friends and I would offer each other after a difficult exchange with a shopper was, strangely, a reminder of hell\u2019s reality. Real people were actually facing eternal condemnation. Constantly. A shot at saving someone from that fate was worth rejection.\n\nAnd yet I still wasn\u2019t satisfied with our approach. People rarely agreed to pray with us, and even those who did hurried away after \u201camen.\u201d No questions, no conversations. I knew the typical consolation of We just plant the seed, and God will give growth if he wills (1 Cor. 3:6), but I\u2019d started to lose confidence that we were really \u201cplanting seeds.\u201d The difficulties we faced seemed prior to \u201cplanting,\u201d and prior, even to the \u201crock of offense\u201d (1 Pet. 2:8, ESV). As I replayed memories of botched approaches in my head, it occurred to me that maybe the gospel hadn\u2019t been what offended our Walmart shoppers; maybe the gall of two strange, Pollyanna-ish teenagers demanding their attention in the chip aisle had.\n\nMy reflections were helped along by my upper-level writing courses. Our classes featured loads of discussions about literature\u2019s devotional potential and the duty of the Christian writer, but there wasn\u2019t pressure to sneak sermons into our stories, nor was there any subtext that our writing would be better if we did. Instead, my professors wanted us to approach storytelling with nuance. We discussed books that overtly proclaimed the gospel, like C. S. Lewis\u2019s Narnia series and John Bunyan\u2019s The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, but we also discussed works that were more subtly\u2014if even detectably\u2014Christian, like Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s short stories and T. S. Eliot\u2019s poetry.\n\nWhatever we read, we focused on craft. We were just as concerned with what an author was saying as we were with how the author was saying it. Good writers, my professors emphasized, care about presentation. They connect with their readers. They build rapport. They use humor, tone, narrative, tact, which is why people feel so affected by their words. These were important breakthroughs for me. They taught me a lesson I desperately needed to learn, with applications far beyond the classroom: One could have a great message but deliver it terribly.\n\nI spent the first half of my senior year applying to MFA programs in creative writing, and by the spring, I had been accepted to one at the University of Iowa. UIowa was the kind of place that chapel speakers referred to as \u201cthe world.\u201d My university president had recently written an article in which he criticized educational systems teaching \u201csecular humanism, evolutionary theory, and a Godless atheism.\u201d I was headed for one of those.\n\nAnd with no semblance of an evangelistic strategy, might I add. My Walmart reflections had persuaded me away from the cold-call approach, but they hadn\u2019t squelched my obligation to the Great Commission. I wanted to lead people to the light, to snatch souls out of the fire (Jude v. 23). But it felt upside-down to show up at a university declaring that I had something to teach everyone else. And I didn\u2019t want to reduce my soon-to-be classmates to a sort of faceless evangelistic cause before even meeting them.\n\nGet-to-know-you questions filled my first weeks at Iowa. Classmates asked me, What was your college like? What do you write about? On repeat, I answered: small Baptist college, very devout, Christian art, conversion. I expected my peers to produce the same look of stunned discomfort that my Walmart targets typically had. Instead, they asked more questions.\n\nMy answers opened new conversations: about my high-school conversion to Christianity, and my junior year discipleship group, and a 62-foot-tall Jesus statue in Ohio. I wondered if all this talk might count as a kind of evangelism. The rubric in my head told me no. I wasn\u2019t \u201cnaming the stakes\u201d or inviting them to bow their heads in informative prayer. But I was providing an account of the Christian life. Of my Christian life. And it was the details they seemed most interested in. The earthiness and humor, for example, of my 14-year-old self googling \u201cserious Jesus colleges Midwest\u201d seemed to give my peers something they could latch onto, some sort of example in which they could locate or revise the things they\u2019d heard about religion.\n\nA bit further into the semester, a classmate asked me why I\u2019d chosen the MFA at Iowa. I explained: As newlyweds, my husband and I decided we both wanted to attend graduate programs. We sat down and made a list of every university in the US that offered both a funded MFA in creative nonfiction and a funded PhD in theoretical physics. We applied until we had no more money to cover application fees. Then we prayed for months. He got accepted into Iowa. I got waitlisted. So we continued to pray and asked everyone we knew to pray, and then a few weeks later, on the national graduate-school deadline, four hours before the midnight cutoff, I got an email letting me know that a spot had opened up for me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d my classmate said, half smiling. \u201cThat sounds \u2026 divine.\u201d\n\nThe moment felt significant: an agnostic glimpsing God. But I didn\u2019t want to push the conversation toward some cosmic ultimatum. Maybe that was my cowardice. Maybe it was something like tact.\n\nI\u2019ve heard all kinds of objections to evangelistic finesse: that God works through broken vessels, that we aren\u2019t to conform to the patterns of the world, that the beauty of the gospel is shared through stumbling lips. I understand the sentiments, and I\u2019m grateful for the ways they encourage Christians who, with Moses, say, \u201cPardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent\u201d (Ex. 4:10). It\u2019s a prayer we all pray at times.\n\nBut I wonder if our familiarity with that prayer has led us to expect bumpy deliveries\u2014or to prefer them, even, misinterpreting a lack of discretion as evangelistic seriousness. It\u2019s easy to cast the plight of a Walmart evangelist in the same light as the apostles\u2019 persecution. It\u2019s harder to admit that confronting strangers with the gospel in the street, a park, or a store might produce an affront that\u2019s more social than theological. Harder to accept that people don\u2019t like being dragged into intimate conversations with strangers. We find ideas more compelling when they\u2019re delivered through the lips of those we know\u2014that is, when there\u2019s a connection, or a relationship, or context.\n\nTo be fair, some are hostile toward evangelism regardless of its delivery, even among friends. In one of my first-semester seminars at Iowa, I listened in on a conversation about proselytizing. I didn\u2019t know the word, but I could identify the sour tone in which it was spoken. One classmate called it condescending. Another used the word fanatical. My professor said it was an act of colonialism. People nodded. It wasn\u2019t until someone explicitly said religion that I understood what we were talking about. They weren\u2019t decrying the \u201cstumbling block\u201d (1 Cor. 1:23) of the gospel; they were wholesale decrying the evangelistic act. They were angered by the overt persuasion of it, by the thought that someone might try to convert them.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Gideons came to Iowa City. They stood on high-traffic sidewalks and passed out pocket-sized New Testaments. I accepted one as a small act of solidarity, despite having six Bibles at home, and then retreated to a nearby academic building to watch from a window. I winced when students waved the Gideons off, glared, or accepted a pocket New Testament only to throw it in the trashcan at the corner. I watched many New Testaments topple into the trash. I saw the Gideons see it, too.\n\nThese were the scenes I held in my head as I worked on my first workshop essay\u2014a personal piece of writing I\u2019d submit to my classmates for feedback. I feared being accused of proselytizing, and I hated that fear, so I mustered the courage I could and wrote about it indirectly. I wrote about the Bible lessons I\u2019d delivered to third graders during my summers working at a Christian camp, and about my time as a public relations writer for my Baptist college\u2019s marketing division, and about my run-in with the Gideons, all situated between my abstract ponderings about religious outreach\u2014about \u201cproselytizing.\u201d It was an unwieldy collage of an essay that I submitted in a panic.\n\nOn the day of my workshop, I heard two clear notes from the room. One, the abstract sections were muddled and unnecessary. Two, they loved the moments when I presented religion through personal stories.\n\nOne classmate told me the essay \u201ccame alive\u201d in the summer-camp scenes. Another said the narrative details made her feel that she was seeing inside Christianity. A third said the personal anecdotes helped her access the essay\u2019s ideas. It wasn\u2019t the reaction I expected, especially with an essay so clearly about religious people sharing their religion. But somehow the narratives created more engagement. A different professor of mine would state it succinctly in a conference with me a couple semesters later: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in talking about Christianity. But I do like your stories.\u201d\n\nHer words called to mind something Paul wrote of his own evangelistic appeal: \u201cTo the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law. \u2026 To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some\u201d (1 Cor. 9:20\u201322). And perhaps we could add: To the writers I became a writer.\n\nThe storyteller and the evangelist alike bring listeners to the brink of a new world. They invite them in, the refrain Come and see on their lips. C. S. Lewis, the gospel allegorist I read in my undergrad literature courses\u2014the writer also responsible for some of the 20th century\u2019s most winsome spiritual essays\u2014described stories, sermonic or not, as windows and doors. That is, access points. Portals. Things people can peer into and step through to \u201csee with other eyes, to imagine with other imaginations, to feel with other hearts.\u201d I can\u2019t think of a better description of what evangelism hopes to accomplish in its hearers.\n\nOf course, this is not a foolproof method; there isn\u2019t one. But I\u2019m convinced evangelists would do well to stash some stories in their pockets, especially for an audience whose greatest need is not airtight doctrinal presentation but a better narrative and a new set of eyes to see it. Again, in Lewis\u2019s words: \u201cOne of the things we feel after reading a great work is \u2018I have got out.\u2019 Or from another point of view, \u2018I have got in.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the workshop, one of my classmates texted me that she was appointing me her \u201cspiritual consultant.\u201d Her words contained some hyperbole, but she wasn\u2019t lying. She began sending her questions my way. How were saints canonized in the Catholic church? How many Marys were in Jesus\u2019 friend group? What did liturgy mean?\n\nOther classmates have joined in, too. Since my first workshop, I\u2019ve been asked, \u201cWhat are the classes of relics? Why did Saint Nicholas and Arius fight? Why do Christians rub ashes on their foreheads in February? Are songbooks the same as hymnals? Is hell a metaphor? Why do Christians get married so young?\u201d And, ever so nonchalantly\u2014\u201cHow does the Incarnation work?\u201d\n\nI love these questions. I love them because they\u2019re meaty, and because they expect answers, and because they bid me to discuss the things of God with seekers and skeptics and friends, which is what I craved and never found in a year\u2019s worth of Walmart aisles.\n\nHeidie Senseman is an MFA candidate in the University of Iowa\u2019s Nonfiction Writing Program.

Walmart has explained the situation, the ministry said without further elaboration.\n\nYuyan Tantian's post said the authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, sought to discuss reports that Walmart had asked suppliers to cut wholesale prices to offset higher US tariffs.\n\nThe social media post said such a move would create risks of supply chain disruption and may \"violate commercial contracts and disrupt the order of normal trading.\"\n\nIt also cautioned Walmart not to pass on costs from the tariffs to its Chinese suppliers.\n\n\"If Walmart insists on doing so, then what awaits Walmart is more than just a meeting,\" according to the post.\n\nBeijing's meeting with Walmart underscores Chinese leaders' concerns about the economy, as US President Donald Trump's trade war injects fresh challenges.\n\n\"Beijing has essentially warned that it would take action against Walmart if Chinese suppliers are coerced to absorb the tariff impact,\" wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research for Asia excluding Japan, in a Thursday note.\n\nBeijing \"is on its guard against US tariff assault on the margins of Chinese manufacturers,\" he added.\n\nThe development shows the tensions between US efforts to blunt inflationary effects from tariffs and Chinese efforts to ward off worsening deflationary risks, wrote Varathan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US started imposing additional new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. On March 4, Trump's administration doubled blanket tariffs on Chinese goods to 20% on top of existing levies.\n\nWalmart did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment outside regular business hours. However, the company confirmed the meeting to Reuters and said it would continue to work closely with suppliers to \"find the best way forward during these uncertain times.\"\n\nChina is the world's factory floor for companies worldwide, including Walmart. The retail giant's $5 billion worth of net sales in China account for about 3.5% of its total net sales globally.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBessent: 'Prices won't go up'\n\nTrump's new tariffs come as China is trying to revive confidence in its economy, which has been struggling to recover since pandemic lockdowns ended. It's dealing with multiple problems including a property crisis, high youth unemployment, and deflation.\n\nIn February, China's consumer inflation fell below zero for the first time in 13 months, highlighting weak demand.\n\nChina's industrial profits at large companies \u2014 a key indicator for how well factories, mines, and utility firms are doing \u2014 fell 3.3% in 2024, marking its third straight year of decline.\n\nLast week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News he was positive Chinese suppliers would absorb the tariffs.\n\n\"With the China tariffs, I am highly confident that the Chinese manufacturers will eat the tariffs \u2014 prices won't go up,\" Bessent said.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing have been simmering for years, spurring companies \u2014 even Chinese ones \u2014 to move manufacturing outside China. The moves accelerated during the pandemic due to supply chains disruptions in China, which implemented on-off lockdowns of nearly three years.\n\nBeneficiaries of the trend include India, Vietnam, and Mexico.",

Beijing appeared to threaten the company after it apparently asked Chinese suppliers to slash their prices to offset the impact of the tariffs.\n\nChinese officials met with Walmart, which also operates its warehouse club chain, Sam\u2019s Club, in China, to discuss the retailer\u2019s request that suppliers absorb the tariffs. Walmart reportedly asked some of its Chinese suppliers to reduce their prices by 10%, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTRUMP'S 25% TARIFF INCREASE ON ALL STEEL, ALUMINUM IMPORTS TAKES EFFECT, PROMPTING RETALIATION FROM EUROPE\n\nOfficials reportedly issued a veiled threat, according to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The outlet added that China Central Television wrote on social media that \"if Walmart insists\" on having suppliers cut prices, \"then what awaits Walmart is not just talk.\"\n\nWSJ also reported that \"Walmart representatives said they would work with Chinese suppliers to find ways to avoid damaging the interests of the parties involved,\" citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nMOVEMENT TO BAN CHINESE FARMLAND PURCHASES NEAR MILITARY BASES GAINS STEAM IN THE SENATE\n\nIn 2023, Walmart appeared to be reducing its reliance on Chinese suppliers. According to a Reuters estimate, 60% of Walmart\u2019s imports from January to August 2023 came from China, down from 80% in 2018. The big-box retailer, according to the outlet, began importing more goods from India.\n\nIn a call with investors last month, Walmart CFO John David Rainey said that the Trump tariffs were \"unpredictable,\" but added that he believed the major retailer \"can navigate that very well.\"\n\nHowever, he expressed concern about the potential impacts of the Trump tariffs on everyday consumers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO\n\nIn response to fentanyl trafficking into the U.S., President Donald Trump imposed a new 20% tariff on China, in addition to the ones Beijing already faces. The president defended his tariff policies during his address to a joint session of Congress.\n\n\"China\u2019s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them,\" Trump said in his address earlier this month.\n\nWalmart did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment.",

Consumers polled by Walmart expressed concerns about their purchasing power.\n\nThe findings come amid frantic tariff headlines that are stoking fears of renewed inflation and a recession.\n\nLejuez hosted Walmart executives at Citi's consumer conference in Florida this week, where the new findings were shared.\n\nThe concerns don't stop there. Walmart is seeing sentiment \"decline\" broadly across income cohorts, regions, and political affiliations.\n\nMoreover, some competitors have already raised prices on food due to tariff worries \u2014 Walmart didn't. That has resulted in wider price gaps on food compared to rivals, according to Lejuez. A \"handful\" of competitors have taken a 15% price increase on avocados, which are largely sourced from Mexico.\n\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\n\nWalmart has seen a sales slowdown in Mexico, but \"not more than a little wobble\" in Canada, accounts Lejuez.\n\nThe analyst maintained a Buy rating on Walmart's stock.\n\nTo be sure, Trump's trade war is well underway.\n\nThe president has paused 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican imports that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA). But the president's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports kicked in today, impacting Canada, Australia, and the European Union.\n\nTrump has implemented a second round of 10% duties on Chinese imports, after instituting 10% in February. The country is a key supplier region for big box retailers like Walmart and rival Target (TGT).\n\nThe targeted countries have wasted no time hitting back.\n\nChina unveiled a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton products, and an additional 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. The new tariffs from China began on Monday.\n\nCanada announced a 25% tariff on 30 billion Canadian dollars of US imports. Tariffs on another CA$125 billion in goods will begin in 21 days.\n\nRead more: Why Amazon's stock is so cheap\n\nThe European Union said it would impose tariffs on $28.33 billion worth of US goods starting in April, impacting everything from apparel to liquor.\n\n\"In this administration, there's a different focus, I think, on the tariff discussion where the administration is looking at trade imbalances and trying to use tariffs against many different companies in a more universal fashion. And so that has created, at least in the short term, a lot more uncertainty,\" Rubbermaid CEO Chris Peterson told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (listen below).",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWalmart does not expect to meet its 2025 plastic packaging reduction and recyclability targets, the retailer revealed in an update published Feb. 28. This follows Walmart saying at the end of 2024 it would miss 2025 and 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.\n\n\u201cWhile we have made significant progress towards our ambitious 2025 goals for recycled content, virgin plastic reduction, and packaging recyclability, we expect to fall short of achieving these goals by 2025,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nWalmart shared data from calendar year 2023 in its post.\n\nWalmart is increasing PCR use and packaging circularity, but also growing virgin plastic use Company-reported progress on 2025 targets, as of calendar year 2023\n\nWalmart also said that 82% of its global private-brand plastic packaging is designed for recycling.\n\nWalmart largely attributed increases in the weight of virgin plastic used to growth in product categories like food. It says it reduced its overall plastic packaging intensity, when measuring weight of plastic per net sales dollar. According to Walmart\u2019s reporting to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, virgin weight totaled nearly 1.07 million metric tons in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to work towards reducing waste, progress depends on many factors outside our control, including emergence and scalability of innovative more-recyclable materials, public policy for materials management systems, infrastructure development (especially to support recyclable and compostable materials), and societal behavior change,\u201d Walmart wrote.\n\nRegarding PCR use, where growth has been slow, Walmart bemoaned challenges with limited supply of high-quality PCR as well as price volatility. It also said that certain laws and regulations restrict PCR use in certain categories of packaging, such as pharmaceuticals.\n\nWalmart says it will keep reporting on those packaging targets. \u201cWe will continue to report progress on our ongoing efforts, as these initiatives help Walmart reduce materials cost and waste, conserve resources, enhance efficiencies, and reduce emissions.\u201d\n\n2025 was a year commonly chosen by businesses for packaging sustainability targets. Other brands and retailers have also shared updates the past year, with multiple major companies recently doubting the feasibility of 2025 targets or opting to drop or change them.\n\nWalmart also participates in the U.S. Plastics Pact, which last year largely pushed collective 2025 goals to 2030. Those shared goals include reducing virgin plastic use by 30%; eliminating \u201cproblematic and unnecessary\u201d materials; recycling half of all plastic packaging; averaging 30% PCR or responsibly sourced biobased content across all plastic packaging; making all plastic packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable; and more.\n\n2023 was also the year Walmart announced it would replace nearly all plastic mailers with paper mailers and rightsize its cardboard boxes to reduce waste in its e-commerce business. That same year, Walmart began selling BPI-certified compostable single-use cutlery under its Great Value store brand.\n\nIn its report, Walmart also highlighted management of secondary packaging, which represents nearly three- quarters of its operational waste stream. Actions include utilizing reusable containers and recycling film and cardboard at scale.",

            "content": "How an on-duty Kansas trooper shoplifted from Topeka Walmart self-checkouts\n\nA former state trooper and National Guard chaplain has lost his certification after shoplifting doughnuts and other merchandise from local Walmart stores while on-duty and wearing his military and law enforcement uniforms.\n\nMark Leenerts, a former Kansas Highway Patrol trooper, had his certification revoked last month by the Kansas Commission on Peace Officers' Standards and Training. The move came after Leenerts pleaded guilty in Shawnee County District Court to two counts of misdemeanor theft and one count of official misconduct.\n\nThe KSCPOST order found that the convictions mean Leenerts no longer meets minimum requirements for certification. Additionally, Leenerts \"failed to maintain good moral character sufficient to warrant the public trust in him as a law enforcement officer.\"\n\nThe only redaction in the KSCPOST order is Leenerts' contact information. The attorney who represented him in his criminal case didn't respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nCourt records show Leenerts was criminally charged in October 2023 and pleaded guilty in August 2024.\n\nJudge James Crowl in August sentenced Leenerts to 12 months probation, with an underlying sentence of a year in jail. He was also fined $317.88 \u2014 the same amount as the value of his thefts \u2014 and ordered to pay other court costs.\n\nWhat highway patrol and National Guard say\n\nThe KSCPOST order said Leenerts was a full-time law enforcement officer with the Kansas Highway Patrol from July 11, 2018, to Sept. 26, 2023.\n\nApril McCollum, a patrol spokesperson, said Leenerts was placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.\n\n\"He chose to resign from his position with the Kansas Highway Patrol (KHP), rather than participate in the internal affairs process,\" McCollum said. \"Nevertheless, KHP supported the criminal investigation conducted by the Topeka Police Department (TPD) and the administrative licensing and certification review by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (CPOST).\n\n\"KHP concurs with those findings and remains committed to eradicating illegal or unprofessional conduct by any law enforcement officer. All agency members will continue to be held to the highest levels of integrity and professionalism.\"\n\nA Facebook post from the 190th Air Refueling Wing of the Kansas Air National Guard at Forbes Field indicates that Leenerts had been wing's chaplain.\n\n\"The Kansas National Guard is aware of Captain Mark Leenerts' conduct and have actively engaged our team to properly address this matter,\" said Jane Welch, a spokesperson for the Adjutant General's Department. \"We are unable to provide further detail at this time because this is an active personnel issue.\"\n\nWhat the Topeka police investigation found\n\nThe partially redacted affidavit in the case was publicly released in December 2023 at the request of a lieutenant colonel with the Kansas Air National Guard. It details the police investigation and allegations against Leenerts.\n\nThe Topeka Police Department investigated the case after a Walmart asset protection worker contacted police in August 2023 about multiple shoplifting incidents. The thefts happened at the Walmart store on Wanamaker and the one at S.W. 37th and Topeka Boulevard.\n\n\"I concluded that Leenerts had in fact failed to render payment for multiple goods using a tactic commonly referred to as 'skip scanning' is a method of feigning the appearance of scanning items and/or performing actions faster than the system can accurately record the transaction,\" TPD detective Brady Qualls wrote in the affidavit.\n\nThe detective reviewed videos of Leenerts using the self-checkouts, then compared receipt of the transaction against the items he put into his grocery bag. Investigators found $317.88 in stolen merchandise across 13 total cases of theft.\n\nIn two of the shoplifting cases, Leenerts was on-duty, wearing his KHP uniform and duty weapon. In three, he was wearing his Kansas Air National Guard uniform.\n\nThe last shoplifting case happened in September 2023, after Leenerts had already been placed on administrative leave by KHP and notified he was under investigation for theft. In that case, Leenerts was wearing his National Guard uniform and was observed with five boxes of doughnuts, but only scanned two, totaling $9.91 in theft.\n\nThe first documented case was in June 2023, when Leenerts was wearing his KHP uniform as he paid for only some of the J-B Weld products he put into the bagging area, stealing $13.08 in merchandise. When a Walmart associate was called over, Leenerts blocked the associate from the bagged items.\n\nThe affidavit identifies additional stolen merchandise, including Hawaiian rolls, M&Ms, Bomb Pops, Oreos, Lunchables, Gatorade, sunscreen, hair product, deodorant and dog food, among others.\n\nRoughly one page of the affidavit was redacted, appearing to be about seven paragraphs. At least some of the redactions appear to be the parts of the affidavit detailing what Leenerts said when questioned about the thefts.\n\nPolice detail shoplifting method\n\nThe police detective detailed Leenerts' skip scan methods, which he said connected all 13 thefts with a \"common scheme.\"\n\n\"Leenerts would stack multiples of the same items together and pass them across the scanner together as if it was only one item.\n\n\"Leenerts would use the provided handheld scanner to scan items in the cart and then grab multiple items both scanned and unscanned and put them into the bags.\n\n\"Leenerts would knowingly grab a certain amount of items and would make less than that number of attempts to scan them, such as grabbing 4 items and make only one attempt to pass a barcode over the scanner but bag all 4 items.\n\n\"Leenerts was attentive enough to what was being scanned when he would accidently double scan a single item he would notify an employee and have them remove the item from the systems so he would not overpay.\n\n\"Leenerts would use what could be described as sleight of hand where he would bag items with one hand while bagging multiple items with the other to appear that he was scanning multiple items.\n\n\"Leenerts would what appeared to be purposely spin, rotate, or cover barcodes while appearing to scan the item(s) that would ultimately never be accurately scan and registered in the system.\"\n\nJason Alatidd is a Statehouse reporter for The Topeka Capital-Journal.

            "content": "Walmart (WMT 1.01%) and Amazon (AMZN 2.09%) have long been the biggest names in retail, and their shareholders have been handsomely rewarded. Walmart has a market capitalization of around $750 billion, and Amazon's exceeds $2 trillion. Both companies continue evolving and investing for the future. That's positive, since businesses need to move forward or risk becoming stagnant and outdated.\n\nBut which one offers the better long-term return potential? That requires a look at the underlying businesses and valuations.\n\nWalmart\n\nWalmart's retail operations have a simple formula. That's to keep costs down to pass those savings on to customers in the form of lower prices. It sounds basic, but Walmart has been devastatingly effective since it first began running discount stores more than six decades ago.\n\nThe basic concept of low prices has remained as management has invested in technology, including building omnichannel capabilities focused on enhancing the customer's convenience and experience. Many of its stores offer same-day delivery, for instance.\n\nLooking at sales growth, its investments have been paying off. At its core Walmart U.S. business, same-store sales (comps) increased 4.6% in the fiscal fourth quarter. Importantly, people still clamored to go to Walmart stores, as evidenced by higher traffic that contributed 2.8 percentage points. Higher spending comprised the balance. The period ended on Jan. 31.\n\nSome investors might have been unnerved by what they deem as lukewarm guidance for this year. Management expects sales to grow 3% to 4%, and operating income to increase 3.5% to 5.5%. However, it's been conservative in the past, giving a similar sales and profit growth outlook last year that Walmart exceeded.\n\nThe company's success isn't a secret, naturally. The stock appreciated by 58% over the past 12 months. During this time, the S&P 500 index has gained just under 13%. The share price increase has resulted in a more expensive valuation. Walmart's stock has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 39 compared to about 30 a year ago. The S&P 500 has a P/E multiple of 29.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon became an early online retailer when it started selling books on its site more than 30 years ago. It rapidly expanded its offerings and now sells virtually everything imaginable; it's become known for competitive prices and fast delivery.\n\nIt's much more than an online seller now, of course. It has devices such as Alexa, the Amazon Prime subscription service, and provides advertising services, to name a few offerings. Last year, the company generated $638 billion in sales, 83% of which came from the North America and international operations that encompass the aforementioned.\n\nHowever, Amazon Web Services (AWS), while representing the balance of sales, produces the majority (58%) of the company's profit. AWS offers cloud computing services. With organizations clamoring for data, the business has grown rapidly, and sales and profits could accelerate as artificial intelligence (AI) continues evolving.\n\nCloud infrastructure spending grew 22% year over year in the fourth quarter, according to Synergy Research Group. AWS remains the market leader in this fast-growing segment with a 30% share. Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud have the next biggest shares at 21% and 12%, respectively.\n\nAWS' fourth-quarter sales increased 18.5% to $107.6 billion, and its profit jumped 61.7% to $39.8 billion. Amazon's shares rose 15.3% over the last year. The stock's P/E multiple has contracted from over 60 to 36. The current P/E ratio is higher than that of the S&P 500, however.\n\nThe choice\n\nIt's a difficult decision. I like both companies and would invest in each one. However, if I could only choose one, I'd buy Amazon based on the stock's slightly more reasonable valuation and the strong position of AWS in a fast-growing market.",

They specifically mentioned placing three boxes of nicotine gum (each $33) on shelves, earning Walmart the equivalent of their night's pay in seconds.\n\n\"Ridiculous that we waste so much when we could take it home to save our wages, since we make so little while everyone at the top sits on all the profit,\" the commenter wrote.\n\nWhy is food waste at major retailers concerning?\n\nWasted food represents wasted money, resources, and labor \u2014 from the water used to grow it to the gas burned to transport it. Food rotting in landfills produces methane, which contributes to our planet's overheating.\n\nThe economic impact is equally troubling. While Walmart employees report struggling with low wages, they simultaneously watch valuable products thrown away. This disconnect between corporate waste and worker compensation raises questions about resource distribution and corporate responsibility.\n\nIs Walmart doing anything about this?\n\nWalmart has made public commitments to reduce waste.\n\nThe company's stated goal is to achieve zero waste in key markets by 2025. It claims to have diverted approximately 78% of unsold products from landfills globally in 2022.\n\nWalmart, along with Sam's Club, has also donated 9 billion pounds of food to local food banks in partnership with Feeding America. However, the Reddit post suggests disconnects between corporate policies and what happens at individual store locations may exist.\n\nWhat's being done about food waste more broadly?\n\nApps like Misfits Market now sell \"ugly\" produce at discount prices rather than letting retailers trash them. Other apps like Too Good To Go enable consumers to buy discounted food that would otherwise be thrown away.\n\nYou can help by buying imperfect-looking fruits and vegetables when shopping, which prevents them from being wasted. Ask your local stores about their food waste policies, as customer interest drives change. Supporting businesses with strong food recovery programs conveys that waste reduction matters to consumers.\n\nCommunity refrigerators and food pantries welcome donations of excess food from both individuals and businesses. Even better, planning meals and shopping with a list helps prevent food waste at home, saving money.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

A northbound SUV was in the process of turning west into the main parking lot. Southbound traffic in the inside lane was stopped due to the light at 18th and Industrial, and there was a space left for the SUV to go through. However, Andrews says southbound traffic in the outside lane was still flowing towards the stoplight. The SUV driver did not see a car in the southbound outside lane and the two vehicles collided. The SUV then partially rolled, bumping an eastbound crossover SUV waiting to leave the parking lot.\n\nInitially, the crash was reported as leading to possible injuries, but Emporia Fire says nobody was transported by ambulance to a hospital. The SUV driver was cited for failure to yield.\n\nNames have not been released.",

A Romanian man is behind bars after card skimmers were found at multiple Walmart locations.\n\nPolice arrested Florin Doroiman near Richmond this week, but he's facing an array of charges in Central Virginia, too.\n\nIn Bedford, police said they found a skimmer at the Walmart on Lynchburg Salem Turnpike.\n\nBedford police plan to charge Doroiman with ten felony counts of credit card theft as well as a misdemeanor charge for having the skimming device. Each of those felony charges could land Doroiman behind bars for up to 20 years.\n\nRELATED:\n\nLynchburg police said a register at the Walmart on Wards Road was also compromised. They said the skimmer was found on a register during a routine morning equipment check.\n\nABC13's Hayden Robertson spoke to Lynchburg City Schools employee Kisha Burton, who told him she had been shopping in the Wards Road Walmart around the time the skimmer was there.\n\n\"I did notice that they were having issues with the self-checkout pieces, and the clerk actually had to come over and assist me scanning my items, and then I checked out,\" Burton said. \"Then the news kinda dropped that so I started watching my account just to see.\"\n\nBurton said it was ABC13s coverage that alerted her about what happened. She said thankfully nothing is missing from her account, but she is still monitoring it.\n\nDoroiman currently has three charges in the Hill City: two felonies and a misdemeanor for credit card theft as well as use and possession of the skimmer.\n\nIn Amherst County, the sheriff's office said they found a skimmer at the Walmart in Madison Heights. They believe EBT cards may have been compromised.\n\nSo far, they've only charged Doroiman with a misdemeanor for installing that skimmer.\n\nIf you went shopping at any of those stores on Feb. 25 or 26, you should check your bank statements.\n\nAccording to Julie Wheeler, president of the Better Business Bureau serving Western Virginia, card skimming is a scam that runs rampant. She said that if you ever swipe your card or use a chip to pay, you need to be careful.\n\nDoes it look like everything else,\" she asked. \"Pay attention to where you're putting your card, and if you have a card that has tap technology, use that.\n\nShe said that's the easiest way to protect yourself and your money.\n\nThe technology right now is ahead of that, and that will change, because it used to be that the chip was enough to keep them from capturing information,\" Wheeler said. \"Right now, tapping or contactless is the way to go if you can do that.",

            "content": "Big-box retailer Walmart (WMT 1.01%) has been one of the most resilient retail stocks to hold over the past five years. It fared well amid the pandemic and rising inflation, as its versatile business has been able to adapt to changing economic conditions. the market has appreciated its success and the stock has rallied more than 146% over the past five years.\n\nRecently, however, there has been growing concern among some investors about a possible slowdown ahead for the company. Given the stock's significant run-up in price, its high valuation could dissuade investors from buying up this blue-chip investment.\n\nIs Walmart's stock in trouble? Could a sell-off be on the horizon?\n\nWalmart offers modest guidance ahead for the current fiscal year\n\nOn Feb. 20, Walmart released its year-end numbers and also issued guidance for the upcoming year. For fiscal 2025, which ended on Jan. 31, the company's top line rose by just over 5% to $681 billion. For fiscal 2026 (now underway), Walmart expects a more modest growth rate between 3% and 4% in net sales. There is also the danger that tariffs could weigh down its growth even further.\n\nThe company was able to generate reliable growth in recent quarters even as consumers cut back on spending. The vast majority of Walmart's sales are groceries (they account for close to 60% of Walmart's sales in the U.S.). By relying primarily on necessities rather than discretionary purchases, Walmart has been a better retail stock to own over the years than other companies. Rival Target, for instance, is heavily impacted by a slowdown in discretionary spending. As a result, Target saw its share price rise by just 11% in the past five years as slowing growth spooked investors.\n\nIs Walmart stock too expensive?\n\nWalmart's sharp stock rally in recent years has been at a much faster pace than its profit growth, and that has pushed up its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to elevated levels. At a P/E of 41, this is not a cheap stock to own by any means. While it arguably deserves a premium over Target (which investors are paying just 13 times earnings for), Walmart is trading at far higher levels than its five-year P/E average.\n\nPaying a high multiple for a business can be justifiable when it is experiencing strong growth. But with Walmart growing its sales at a slower pace this year, some investors may consider taking a step back from the stock.\n\nWalmart's outlook isn't optimal, and that's a problem when the stock trades at 40 times earnings. Expectations are high. This could lead to a significant correction in the weeks ahead depending on what happens with tariffs as it directly relates to Walmart.\n\nWalmart investors should brace for some adversity ahead\n\nBetween its high valuation, slowing growth, and the potential for tariffs to weigh on its bottom line, I do think Walmart's stock could be in a bit of trouble and experience a sharp decline in the near future.\n\nThe silver lining, however, is that if there is a fall in price, then that will only make it a better buy for long-term investors interested in the stock. While the economic conditions ahead may be worrisome for investors, they aren't going to last forever. If you're looking to hang on to the retail stock for at least five-plus years, Walmart can still make for an excellent buy even if there isn't a big correction. Investors, however, should brace for some possible volatility over the next few years.",

(NYSE:WMT) stands against the other best discount store stocks to invest in.\n\nIs Inflation and Slow Economic Growth on the Horizon for the US?\n\nThe market is abuzz with concerns about the economic growth of the US, with inflation-related worries infesting consumer confidence. These factors are gaining force as the tariff deadlines imposed by President Trump on Canada and Mexico steadily approach after a delay in February. Investors are also skeptical about the labor market impacts of the initiatives taken by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe Conference Board reported that the consumer confidence index fell 7 points to 98.3, experiencing its largest fall since August 2021 and below the Dow Jones forecast of 102.3. In addition, The Expectations Index dropped to a 72.9 reading, reflecting a decrease of 9.3 points. The measure has tumbled below the level consistent with recession for the first time since June 2024.\n\nThese trends show that consumers are becoming increasingly pessimistic about the country\u2019s economic outlook, and this pessimism reached new heights in February due to skepticism surrounding rising inflation and a slowing economy, according to the Conference Board. CNBC reported that Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cThe present situation index improved, but consumers expect dark skies ahead. Change can be scary, so it\u2019s not surprising that confidence is falling.\u201d\n\nJoseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet in New York, expressed similar sentiments, as reported by CNBC:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of back and forth on Trump\u2019s initiatives, and certainly markets in general long term, don\u2019t like tariffs. There\u2019s definitely nervousness out there because some of these things could go the wrong way. Certainly, inflation hasn\u2019t shown any sign of further retreat.\u201d\n\nWe discussed the major drop in consumer sentiment in a recently published article on the 10 Cheap Food Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

This would force manufacturers to consider buying supplies from Vietnam, and it raises concerns that lower prices would mean inferior products.\n\nWalmart and rival Amazon were cautious when presenting their first-quarter earnings and outlooks, in part due to concerns about how the tariffs might impact consumer spending.\n\n\u201cUncertainty seems to be the buzzword of earnings calls,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at research firm GlobalData, told PYMNTS in an interview last week. \u201cGoing into this year, a lot of retailers are very nervous about various aspects of policy, particularly tariffs. They fear both the cost implications for their businesses and the dampening impact higher prices would have on spending. We are seeing this come out in guidance.\u201d\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence found that 78% of consumers expect tariffs to drive prices higher, and 75% worry about product shortages. The uncertainty about tariffs \u2014 with Washington exempting some items and Mexico waiting to announce its response \u2014 could cause consumers to pivot from spending to saving.\n\nIt\u2019s not just consumers who are worried. PYMNTS Intelligence found that 80% of chief financial officers in the retail and goods segments said higher costs for supplies and potential shortages of essentials would hurt their bottom lines.\n\n\u201cShort supply means that prices would rise even more sharply for end consumers under the simple laws of supply and demand,\u201d PYMNTS wrote this week. \u201cIn general, the majority of CFOs surveyed \u2014 at least 60% \u2014 see greater economic uncertainty and planning challenges.\u201d",

This 40% off bag is a great lightweight travel tote. It had a trendy puffer look to it, which also serves to cushion whatever you\u2019re carrying. The bag weighs less than a pound and has three exterior and six interior pockets, giving you many spots to tuck things away. It also has a padded compartment for your laptop.\n\nAt nearly half off, this carry-on spinner bag is a great deal for those who will be getting on an airplane anytime soon. It weighs just under six pounds, has a hard shell exterior and multi-directional wheels that make it easy to push through crowded airports, according to the brand. Inside, one side has a fully zippered closure, while the other has straps to keep your items in place. This bag has a 4.6-star average rating from over 3,300 reviews at Walmart.\n\nMultipurpose pieces can make traveling much easier. This backpack can also be worn as a purse, which may help you reduce how much you have to pack. The faux leather bag has two zippered compartments on the exterior and two side pockets for water bottles or umbrellas. Inside, it has three slit pockets that can carry items like your phone, keys or wallet. It has two straps so you can wear it as a backpack, or a removable shoulder strap if you want to wear it as a purse. This bag has a 4.4-star average rating from over 5,125 reviews on Amazon.\n\nThis set is from Securitech by Delsey and comes with a 20-inch carry-on spinner and a 27-inch spinner that can be checked. Both bags have spinner wheels that rotate in all directions, retractable handles and have hard shell exteriors with a scratch-resistant coating, according to the brand.. The set is available in silver or blue.\n\nThis set, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 1,200 reviews at Walmart, comes with a 20-inch spinner bag, a weekender bag and a toiletry bag. The carry-on spinner has a TSA-approved lock and a telescopic handle that can be set at different heights.

            "content": "Walmart Connect last week made the latest addition to its suite of offerings for advertisers, launching a Display Advertising API that expands the onsite display ads that its partner agencies can offer through their platforms. The move is part of the broader evolution of the retailer\u2019s advertising business, which grew 27% to $4.4 billion in 2024.\n\nIn beta tests with ad tech firms Pacvue, Skai and DataCaciques, the Display Advertising API helped drive a \u201chuge\u201d lift in performance when brands bought search and onsite display ads together, stated Ryan Mayward, senior vice president of sales at Walmart Connect.\n\nGenerally, customers seeing a brand\u2019s ads in both search and display channels are three times more likely, on average, to buy the brand\u2019s products, and they tend to spend 40% more on those items compared to consumers who saw just search ads, Mayward said. Similarly, campaigns for hardline products running both search and display ads concurrently saw an incremental sales increase of 39%, while campaigns in the retailer\u2019s entertainment, toys and seasonal category saw a 67% boost, compared to campaigns with just search ads alone.\n\nWhile Walmart has enabled self-service buying of display ads in the Walmart shopping app for a few years, marketers had to access Walmart Connect and buy through the company\u2019s interface. The launch of the new API allows marketers to use their existing technology partners for campaign management, reporting and optimization tools \u2014 which could be a benefit for marketers looking to buy ads across an increasingly fragmented retail media landscape.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of those companies is to help solve complexity for advertisers that are selling their products across multiple e-commerce platforms,\u201d Mayward said. \u201cWe want to support that.\u201d\n\nConnect\u2019s evolution\n\nWalmart Connect, formerly Walmart Media Group, is relatively new, at least compared to offerings from competitors including Amazon and Target. Until about two years ago, the company was mostly concerned with creating a best-in-class paid search platform, and has since worked to build a tech stack in house. Walmart Connect now includes self-service buying tools, campaign management APIs and second-price auctions.\n\nSimultaneously, Walmart Connect has grown its offsite media business, standing up the Walmart DSP in partnership with The Trade Desk and integrating with social platforms and major media companies to access connected TV (CTV) inventory \u2014 the fastest growing part of its ad business for the last couple years, Mayward said.\n\nThe two parts of the business have worked in tandem, enabling advertisers to reach Walmart\u2019s customers offsite, drive them to the retailer\u2019s app and use paid search to close the sale. But while those functions address the top and bottom of the funnel, the middle of the funnel has been underserved.\n\n\u201cThe connective tissue in the middle \u2014 the consideration element of the funnel \u2014 has not been our strongest area. Onsite display is that connective tissue,\u201d Mayward explained.\n\nWith offsite media filling the top of the funnel with prospects, display ads in the shopping app help close the gap before the bottom-of-funnel sale. Cost-per-click ads can help builds sales and drive incrementality, engaging with and pushing consumers into more high-intent searches or other shopping experiences.\n\nClean rooms and CTV\n\nFor brands seeking deeper insights about audience segmentation and performance than what it can provide with its standard reporting capabilities, Walmart Connect has been testing a clean room environment in partnership with an agency partner and several large CPG clients.\n\n\u201cThe clean room will be a new area for us to help brands understand how to use more granular data to answer questions that they have that standard reporting metrics don't answer off the shelf,\u201d Mayward said.\n\nThe complexity of Walmart Connect\u2019s data is compounded by the CTV products that it has incorporated in the last few years. The company has seen significant demand for CTV from marketers, especially major food and consumable brands, who hope to use shopping-based signals to better target CTV ads and then used closed-loop measurement to determine outcomes.\n\nDespite all the investment in the long-gestating convergence of CTV and retail media, experiments and testing are still needed to determine exactly what CTV can do \u2014 from driving consideration to product detail pages to attracting new-to-brand buyers and driving return on ad spend.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Sharpening the picture on connected TV marketing, from the editorial team at Marketing Dive. Go deeper with an exclusive virtual event,, from the editorial team at Marketing Dive. Learn more \u2794\n\nWalmart for years has been testing and learning with brands by accessing CTV inventory from NBCUniversal, Disney, Paramount and others through its Walmart DSP. Now, CTV is set to become an even larger part of the business as Walmart integrates the acquisition of smart TV maker Vizio, which closed in December and is expected to create new opportunities for advertisers.\n\n\u201cVizio just compliments everything in that [growth],\u201d Mayward said. \u201cThey're obviously operating independently and will for the foreseeable future, and you'll hear more from us during the NewFronts about what we have cooking.\u201d",

Here's what's changes you will see.\n\nPLOVER \u2212 Walmart is starting a renovation project at its Plover store that is expected to last through mid-summer.\n\nMark Rickel, Walmart\u2019s director of corporate communications, told a Stevens Point Journal reporter construction on the site at 250 Crossroads Drive in Plover started this month, and the company is aiming to complete the renovation in July. The store will be open throughout the entire process, he said.\n\nWalmart Plover recently posted an update on Facebook that construction has officially started, and crews are excited to bring a better, cleaner, brighter experience with a new assortment of merchandise. The Plover building will also expand to better serve customers with pick-up and delivery options.\n\nWalmart has been working through store renovations for several years, Rickel said, transforming the brick-and-mortar stores into the \u201cStore of the Future\u201d model. The company\u2019s goal is to create a different type of shopping experience for customers, bridging the gap between shopping in the store, shopping online and using Walmart\u2019s app, he said.\n\nRickel said the latest renovations typically involve new lighting and space enhancements with new brands, new apparel and a variety of new displays. In the home department, for example, shoppers will see a bedroom set on display to help visualize their space, Rickel said. Various departments will also offer QR codes to engage with customers in the store. A shopper could scan a QR code for an item that takes them to Walmart\u2019s website, and they could order online and have it shipped directly to their home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about elevating the in-store experience but giving you the ability to go online and ship directly to your home,\u201d Rickel said.\n\nMore about Walmart's plans: Walmart stores to be remodeled in almost every state; 150 new locations coming in next 5 years\n\nWhat is the 'Store of the Future?'\n\nAccording to a January 2024 post by John Furner, Walmart's president and CEO, on the company's website, the company is working to build or convert more than 150 stores while continuing its program to remodel existing stores to reflect its \"Store of the Future\" model. The concept features improved layouts, expanded product selections and innovative technology to help make shopping more enjoyable and convenient for shoppers.\n\nAccording to the website, the facilities will include more energy-efficient equipment and lighting, lower impact refrigerants and more sustainable features.\n\nFor more information, visit corporate.walmart.com or find Walmart Plover on Facebook.\n\nContact Caitlin at cshuda@gannett.com or follow her on Twitter @CaitlinShuda.",

RSVP .\n\nAs President Donald Trump\u2019s promised tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada become a reality, brands are anticipating that they will charge higher prices to pay for the trade war.\n\nPublic company CEOs are getting prodded for answers from investors about the impact of tariffs on their businesses.\n\nADWEEK pulled together recent earnings reports and news to see how executives are talking about tariffs. Their answers are presented alphabetically, by company.\n\nSome of the quotes have been edited for brevity.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch: Robert Ball, svp and chief financial officer\n\nExpecting a $5 million loss in operating income\n\nDuring fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on March 5, Ball gave analysts an exact figure on the impact of tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe expect full year operating margin in the range of 14% to 15%,\u201d Ball said. \u201cWe expect the first half will be adversely impacted by higher year-over-year freight costs and more normalized carryover inventory selling, and the second half will benefit from expected lower freight than last year.\n\n\u201cFor tariffs, our outlook includes U.S. tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico currently in effect. We expect a 2025 impact of around $5 million. Our outlook does not include any other potential incremental tariffs.\u201d\n\nAdidas: Bjorn Gulden, CEO and member of the executive board\n\nGoal to grow by double digits in the U.S. is under threat\n\nGulden warned about an impact to U.S. growth during its fiscal 2024 earnings.\n\n\u201cOur assumption is that we should grow double digits in the U.S. starting now and forever. I have to do a disclaimer though because we don\u2019t know what these tariffs will cause in the whole market,\u201d Gulden said during an earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we should have the ambition to be No. 1 in all markets except for the U.S. Why not No. 1 in the U.S.? Well, we are so far behind and our competitors are strong\u2026\u201d\n\nBest Buy: Corie Barry, CEO\n\nConsumers will likely pay more for Apple and Samsung products\n\nOnly 2% to 3% of products that Best Buy directly imports comes from Mexico and Canada.\n\nBut the manufacturers that sell products in Best Buy, like Apple and Samsung, heavily rely on international manufacturing. If those manufacturers pass along tariff costs to Best Buy and other retailers, it will likely result in higher prices for consumers, Barry said during Best Buy\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on March 4.\n\nThe potential impact of tariffs were not included in Best Buy\u2019s broad financial guidance for the upcoming year. However, Best Buy estimates that the China tariffs that went into effect on Feb. 4 will result in one negative percentage point in this year\u2019s sales.\n\n\u201cI think I need to state the obvious\u2014we\u2019ve never seen this kind of breadth of tariffs and this, of course, impacts the whole industry,\u201d Barry said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a Best Buy question. It is a broad industry question. And I say that because that makes the estimation of the impact all the harder, especially when you\u2019re in the guts of a replacement and upgrade cycle where people really need the stuff.\u201d\n\nThe Campbell\u2019s Company: Mick Beekhuizen, CEO, president, and director\n\nPricing will go up depending on the duration of the tariffs\n\n\u201cIf I look at this particular situation, it\u2019s obviously evolving. It\u2019s multifaceted,\u201d Beekhuizen said during fiscal second-quarter earnings on March 5.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, we have the country tariffs, with both Canada and Mexico specifically for us, and then also some of the proposed steel and aluminum tariffs. Then there might even be additional tariffs that we are obviously closely monitoring the situation and making sure we develop plans if they were to come to fruition.\n\n\u201cBut if it gets implemented as is currently announced, we are importing from Canada both tinplate steel, which is used in our cans, as well as canola oil used for our chips.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side, with some of the reference to the retaliatory tariffs, those mainly relate to Canadian exports. We are producing our soup in the United States, and we\u2019re importing it into Canada\u2014and that would obviously have an impact on that business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closely working with our suppliers to mitigate potential impact. At the same time, depending on how long these tariffs would be in place, as well as the extent of the tariffs, we might need to take other actions. And that could include, for instance, pricing for some of our products. That being said, I\u2019m going to be very focused to make sure that we provide a good value to our consumers.\u201d\n\nChipotle: Scott Boatwright, CEO\n\nPrices will stay the same\n\nChipotle relies on a lot of avocados imported from Mexico. But Boatwright recently told NBC News that the fast-casual restaurant will absorb any cost increases from tariffs, regardless of how expensive its ingredients will get.\n\nHis comment is a reversal from February, when Chipotle downplayed the impacts of tariffs during its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. At the time, Chipotle said that only half of its avocados come from Mexico.\n\nE.l.f. Cosmetics: Mandy Fields, chief financial officer\n\nDiversifying beyond China, and learning from past tariff wars\n\nE.l.f. Cosmetics makes most of its products in China, and is using its previous experience with rising tariffs in 2019 to withstand the new changes, Fields said during its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Feb. 6.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have a successful playbook to leverage from 2019 when tariffs move to the 25% level,\u201d Fields said during the earnings call. \u201cThis included supplier concessions, cost savings, and select price increases.\u201d\n\nE.l.f. Cosmetics is also diversifying its manufacturing outside of China, Fields said.\n\nSkechers: John Vandemore, chief financial officer\n\nVendors are expected to absorb tariff costs\n\n\u201cThings are changing so quickly that the lack of stability really makes giving any forward perspective difficult because there\u2019s so much uncertainty,\u201d Vandemore said during an investor conference on March 4. \u201cWhat I can tell you is at a product level, we believe we\u2019re delivering an attractive value proposition for the consumer that\u2019s yielding significantly improved gross margins, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019ll continue to focus on that.\n\n\u201cI anticipate that your next question would be, \u2018Okay, what are you going to potentially do if there are more tariffs or with these tariffs?\u2019 And the answer is simply going to be the same things that we\u2019ve done in the past. Whenever we\u2019re faced with challenges like this, we work very closely with our vendors. We look to them to absorb some of the impact.\u201d\n\nTarget: Brian Cornell, CEO\n\n\u201cLikely\u201d price increases for bananas, avocados, and strawberries\n\n\n\nTarget warned of increasing prices for produce during its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on March 4.\n\nIn a follow-up interview with CNBC after earnings, Cornell pinpointed Target\u2019s heavy reliance on fruit imported from Mexico, impacting the prices of avocados, strawberries, and bananas.\n\n\u201cThose are categories where we\u2019ll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,\u201d Cornell told CNBC.\n\nThredUp: James Reinhart, cofounder, CEO, and director\n\nThrifted clothing will benefit as apparel prices rise\n\nThredUp reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on March 3, and included data suggesting that there could be a boom in second-hand clothing if tariffs increase apparel prices\u2014particularly since retailers rely heavily on China for manufacturing.\n\nAccording to ThredUp\u2019s own data, 62% of consumers are worried that government policies will increase apparel prices. And if tariffs make clothing more expensive, 59% of consumers will look for cheaper options like second-hand products.\n\n\u201cOur take is that with tariffs and inflation dominating the national conversation, consumers are concerned about price hikes across retail,\u201d Reinhart said during the earnings call. \u201cIn this environment, second-hand could become more attractive for shoppers seeking out affordable high-quality clothing.\u201d\n\nWalmart: Doug McMillon, CEO\n\nGrowth will slow\n\nEven though Walmart largely sources its products from the U.S., the retail giant isn\u2019t immune to tariffs, McMillion told investors during its recent fiscal year fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nThe retailer warned of slowing upcoming growth, partly due to uncertainties around tariffs.\n\n\u201cTariffs are something we\u2019ve managed for many years, and we\u2019ll just continue to manage that,\u201d McMillon said during the earnings call. \u201cWe can\u2019t predict what will happen in the future, but we can manage it really well.\u201d",

Katie Jennings, a crime prevention specialist with the Lynchburg Police Department, noted that loss prevention partners often discover these devices. \"A lot of time our loss prevention partners are the ones who find these, and it\u2019s because they are looking at the credit card readers and they might be a little discolored, they might be a little thicker, they might look a little bit different,\" said Jennings. \"We also have citizens who find them.\"\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nJennings advised citizens to compare card readers at checkout and report any discrepancies to sales associates. \"If you are at the checkout, kind of take a glance at some of the other card readers, and if yours looks a little different you can tell the sales associate, and you guys can work together and see if it\u2019s something where something\u2019s loose, something doesn\u2019t feel right,\" she said.\n\nAuthorities recommend using chip payments or tap-to-pay methods for increased security. They warn that skimming devices may also be found at other grocery stores, gas stations, ATMs, and anywhere else card transactions occur.\n\nABC13 reached out to Walmart for comment. They replied with this statement: \u201cWalmart works hard to keep our customers safe from scammers and other criminals seeking to harm our customers. Walmart\u2019s robust anti-fraud program has been effective at fighting fraud and continuously evolves to respond to the fraudsters\u2019 ever-changing tactics.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nStarbucks has hired Cathy Smith, Nordstrom\u2019s chief financial officer and treasurer, as its CFO. She replaces Rachel Ruggeri, who has held the position since early 2021 , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .\n\nRuggeri, who has worked at Starbucks for 20 years, will help with the transition, CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement . He did not mention the exact date of her departure.\n\nRuggeri\u2019s departure is the latest change to the company\u2019s executive leadership and corporate structure since Niccol took power in September .\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe first six months of the Niccol era have seen a succession of changes to Starbucks\u2019 C-suite.\n\nNiccol\u2019s changes have largely fallen into three categories. The first are alterations to the company\u2019s structure and operations. Within weeks of Niccol\u2019s appointment, the brand\u2019s North America CEO Michael Conway announced his retirement, and his role was dissolved.Starbucks let go of 1,100 corporate employees in late February, in a move intended to increase efficiency by removing managerial layers and duplication of responsibilities.\n\nCuts and operational changes extend to the store level: Starbucks is in the process of eliminating about 30% of its menu and Niccol has shifted the chain toward a coffeehouse brand identity. Those changes were a clear retreat from the brand\u2019s scattershot, product-heavy approach to driving traffic both during Laxman Narasimhan\u2019s period as CEO and Howard Schultz\u2019s third turn as chief.\n\nNiccol has also focused on hiring executives who have worked with him in the past: in October, Starbucks appointed Tressie Lieberman \u2014 who had worked with Niccol at Chipotle \u2014 as chief brand officer.\n\nIn January, the chain hired two Taco Bell alums to replace departing executives in the roles of executive vice president and president of North America and chief of customer solutions and supply chain. Shortly thereafter, Niccol hinted that the coffee chain may try to double its U.S. storecount.\n\nThe third category of change undertaken in the Niccol era is the hiring of C-suite leaders from outside the immediate restaurant industry: in November, Starbucks hired a new chief sustainability officer from Mars.\n\nSmith\u2019s hiring falls into this third category. She joins the coffee chain after about two years at Nordstrom, where she was CFO when the Nordstrom family secured control of the company in a $6.25 billion deal late last year. Prior to that, she was chief financial and administrative officer for Bright Health Group from 2020 to 2023, after significant tenures at both Target and Walmart International, according to the SEC filing.\n\nStarbucks offered the CFO post to Smith on Feb. 27, according to the SEC filing, complete with a $925,000 yearly salary, a $5 million signing bonus and more than $10 million in equity to compensate Smith for payment forfeited by departing Nordstrom.",

The tariffs would impose a 25% hike on imports from Mexico and Canada and a 20% increase on imports from China, up from the previously estimated 10%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsumers, already stretched thin by rising costs, are being forced to make difficult choices, and Walmart (WMT+0.56% ) is seeing this firsthand. Customers are \u201cbuying smaller packs of consumer goods,\u201d McMillion said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA major driver behind this inflationary pressure is the soaring cost of food, particularly eggs. In Jan. 2024, inflation hit its highest level since Aug. 2023, largely due to sky-high prices of eggs, according to the U.S. Labor Department\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI). The ongoing bird flu crisis, which has wiped out millions of chickens, continues to exacerbate the supply shortage and drive up costs.\n\nThe situation is expected to worsen, with further price pressures on the horizon. Walmart is among those warning of the challenges ahead. In Nov. 2024, Walmart CFO John David Rainey said the retailer would likely pass the price onto consumers if the tariffs go into effect. \u201cWe never want to raise prices,\u201d he told CNBC (CMCSA+2.31% ) at the time, \u201cbut there will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Feb. 2025, Walmart issued a cautious forecast for the year, warning that 2025 would likely not see the same level of massive gains it saw in 2024. The gangbusters year was driven by shoppers earning above $100,000 annually, who accounted for 75% of the company\u2019s market share growth.\n\nWalmart recently lost its revenue crown to Amazon (AMZN+1.95% ). McMillion acknowledged that competition is fierce on a podcast episode for Bloomberg\u2019s Big Take. However, the CEO emphasized that rather than trying to stamp out the competition, Walmart is learning from it \u2013 hiring former talent from Amazon and Google (GOOGL+1.35% ) \u2013 while also working to win over the president.",

It has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King.\n\nWalmart has experienced a resurgence of growth in the past few years by adapting to the changing retail climate. It has invested heavily in its e-commerce platform and proven that it is one of the best-equipped to compete with Amazon.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nThe first Walmart store opened in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas. It was founded by Sam Walton, who started the business with a simple vision: to offer the lowest prices. This philosophy led to Walmart\u2019s huge growth over the years.\n\nWalmart went public in 1972. At that time, it had 51 stores, and annual sales of $78 million.\n\nToday, Walmart generates annual sales of more than $700 billion. It operates more than 10,500 stores, serving nearly 230 million customers each week.\n\nWalmart has also expanded into various services, making it a true conglomerate. The Walmart U.S. segment includes retail stores in all 50 U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico.\n\nIt also includes Walmart\u2019s digital business. Walmart International has operations in 25 countries outside the U.S.\n\nLastly, Sam\u2019s Club is a membership-only warehouse club that operates in 48 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nWalmart posted fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on February 20th, 2025, The company reported strong Q4 2025 results, with revenue rising 4.1% to $180.6 billion and operating income up 8.3%. eCommerce grew 16% globally, driven by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. The company\u2019s advertising business expanded by 29%, boosting profitability. GAAP EPS was $0.65, while adjusted EPS reached $0.66.\n\nFor FY25, revenue hit $681 billion (+5.1%), with operating income up 8.6%. Walmart strengthened its financial position with a 7.9% ROA and a 15.5% ROI. The company completed its VIZIO acquisition and raised its dividend by 13% to $0.94 per share, the largest increase in over a decade.\n\nLooking ahead, Walmart projects FY26 net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted operating income growth of 3.5% to 5.5%. Q1 FY26 net sales are expected to rise 3% to 4%, with adjusted EPS between $0.57 and $0.58. The company remains focused on market expansion, supply chain optimization, and eCommerce growth.\n\nSource: Investor Presentation\n\nWe currently forecast Walmart to grow its earnings-per-share by 11% per year over the next five years.\n\nCompetitive Advantages & Recession Performance\n\nWalmart\u2019s main competitive advantage is its massive scale. Its distribution efficiencies allow Walmart to keep transportation costs low. It can pass on these savings to customers through everyday low prices.\n\nWalmart retains its brand strength through advertising. Because of its immense financial resources, Walmart can afford to spend billions each year on advertising.\n\nWalmart\u2019s competitive advantage also provides the company with steady profitability, even during recessions. The company performed phenomenally well during the Great Recession.\n\nIt steadily grew earnings-per-share each year in that time.\n\n2007 earnings-per-share of $3.16\n\n2008 earnings-per-share of $3.42 (8.2% increase)\n\n2009 earnings-per-share of $3.66 (7% increase)\n\n2010 earnings-per-share of $4.07 (11% increase)\n\nThis was a very impressive performance, in one of the worst recessions in decades. The company continued to generate strong results last year, when the U.S. economy entered recession due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWalmart\u2019s growth indicates the company might actually benefit from recessions. As the low-cost leader in retail, Walmart conceivably sees higher traffic during economic downturns, when consumers scale down from higher-priced retailers.\n\nValuation & Expected Returns\n\nWalmart shares currently trade at $97. Using our earnings-per-share estimate of $2.65 for the current fiscal year, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.6x. This is well above the stock\u2019s historical valuation, which is at a 10-year high.\n\nWe currently view a P/E ratio of 25 as fair value for Walmart stock. If the valuation multiple were to revert to our fair value estimate over the next five years, the company\u2019s total returns would decline by 7.0% per year.\n\nWalmart shares have performed very well for an extended period. While this has rewarded shareholders with strong returns, we view Walmart stock as highly overvalued.\n\nAside from changes in the P/E multiple, Walmart should also generate returns from earnings growth and dividends. A projection of expected returns is below:\n\n11.0% earnings-per-share growth\n\n1.0% dividend yield\n\n-7.0% multiple reversion\n\nWalmart stock is projected to generate a total return of 5% per year over the next five years.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile many retailers have struggled to adapt to the change in commerce shopping habits, Walmart has made the proper strategic investments, in our view. The company\u2019s impressive e-commerce growth reflects this view.\n\nThe company has performed well and the stock is currently trading at an all-time high. We find the company\u2019s dividend track record impressive, even if the most recent dividend hike was 13%.\n\nWalmart is a safe, defensive stock in times of economic hardship, but its rich valuation prevents it from being a buy today. As a result, we rate it a hold.\n\nIf you are interested in finding more high-quality dividend growth stocks suitable for long-term investment, the following Sure Dividend databases will be useful:\n\nThe major domestic stock market indices are another solid resource for finding investment ideas.

            "content": "Bill Gates has dedicated years and billions of dollars to addressing climate change. His foundation has directed substantial funding toward climate technology solutions while consistently highlighting major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly those from large energy and manufacturing companies that burn fossil fuels extensively. However, Gates believes that many people overlook one of the significant contributors to climate change: agriculture, particularly methane emissions from livestock and the impact of fertilizers.\n\nThe foundation has been a major financial backer of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for malaria and tuberculosis vaccine research. It also played a pivotal role in launching Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which spearheads immunization efforts in low-income nations. Headquartered in Seattle, the foundation continues to expand its global impact. Following a $20 billion donation, Gates outlined plans to boost its annual spending by 50%, targeting $9 billion by 2026.\n\nAccording to a report by Business Insider, Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett have collectively contributed around $100 billion to the Gates Foundation to date. During an interview with the BBC, the Microsoft co-founder and Gates Foundation chair disclosed the extent of his philanthropic efforts. According to a foundation fact sheet, Gates and French Gates, who are now divorced, donated a total of $59.5 billion between the organization's inception in 2000 and the end of 2023. Meanwhile, Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has contributed an additional $39.3 billion.\n\nIn 2000, Bill and Melinda Gates established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , now one of the world's largest charitable organizations. The foundation focuses on public health, poverty reduction, education, and climate change. Since 1994, the Gateses have contributed over $50 billion to its initiatives, including more than $1.94 billion in grants for vaccine research during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBill Gates is one of the most influential figures in the modern world. The software company he co-founded, best known for its Windows operating system, ranks among the most valuable companies globally, boasting a market capitalization of $3 trillion. This success has contributed to Gates becoming one of the wealthiest individuals, with his net worth recently estimated at $108 billion.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Bill Gates . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against the other stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince 2015, Breakthrough Energy, the climate-focused investment firm he founded, has allocated $2.2 billion to more than 160 startups and initiatives, aiming to generate investor returns while reducing emissions. In addition to these investments through the firm, Gates has also pursued climate-focused ventures independently. Some of these startups focus on practical solutions, such as sealants to improve heating efficiency, while others explore more unconventional approaches, including burying plant waste to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nAs of Q4 2024, The Gates Foundation, managed by Michael Larson, has a portfolio valued at over $42 billion. The tech and industrial goods sectors represented 29% and 26.3% of the portfolio, respectively. The finance sector made up over 21% of the fund\u2019s portfolio. In view of this, we will take a look at the best stocks to buy according to Bill Gates.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the latest stocks in Bill Gates\u2019 portfolio, we scanned through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s SEC filings for the fourth quarter and picked out the top ten stocks with the highest investment stakes.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWalmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT)\n\nStake Value as of Q4 2024: $821,324,597\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an Arkansas-based retail behemoth that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount stores, and grocery stores across the US. The company operates more than 10,750 stores and clubs in 19 countries and eCommerce websites.\n\nWalmart Inc.

The company\u2019s EPS also came in at $0.66 compared to market expectations of $0.65, thanks to higher gross margins, membership income growth, and improved E-Commerce economics. Walmart maintains a robust balance sheet, generating $36.4 billion in operating cash flow in FY 2025 and ending the year with $9 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

            "content": "Harry Slatkin needs no introduction in retail. He and his wife, Laura, brought candles and the home fragrance category to life more than three decades ago after leaving jobs on Wall Street.\n\nSlatkin said he got into the candle business by happenstance after his brother Howard, a Manhattan interior designer, asked him and Laura to take over his sideline candle business. Harry and Laura formed Slatkin + Co. in 1991. The home fragrance brand was sold to Limited Brands in 2005 for an estimated $15 million. Harry Slatkin ran Bath & Body Works for more than six years, growing the business from $100 million in sales to more than $1 billion when he stepped down in 2012.\n\nSlatkin said in a phone interview that the category was new when he entered the luxury home candle business. He said that in the past, if you wanted to find a quality, long-burn candle in retail you had to go to the eighth floor of Saks Fifth Avenue, and in the back corner on a dusty shelf you might find a candle.\n\nSlatkin + Co. candles entered Saks, Ralph Lauren, Neiman Marcus, and a host of specialty design shops and upscale retailers on the ground floors as the category grew legs in the 1990s. He said they worked with master perfumers to create home fragrances that replicated real aromas. He said the cherry scent does not smell like cough drops but fresh bing cherries at a farmers market in Vermont. The lemons smell like the fresh lemons on the Amalfi Coast in the Mediterranean, not like furniture polish.\n\n\u201cThe smell must be authentic, and I spend six to nine months developing each scent used in our candles and bath and body products with top perfumers in the world that can replicate scents that take you to the Bahamas for the weekend or scent your kitchen like limoncello cupcakes just coming out of the oven,\u201d Slatkin said.\n\nIn 2017, Slatkin was contacted by QVC to sell directly to consumers through that home shopping platform. He developed the HomeWorx brand of home fragrance and self-care products that are still sold on that network. He said he became a fan of Sam Walton after listening to his biography on long drives to tape QVC shows in Pennsylvania from his home bases in New York and Florida.\n\n\u201cI have long been a fan of Sam Walton because his business ethos was akin to mine,\u201d Slatkin said \u201cOne thing that stood out to me was the customer always rules. He listened to his employees and surrounded himself with top talent. He never stopped trying to improve the operation and learn something new. So when I got the chance to have Slatkin + Co. in Walmart, I was proud to do it.\u201d\n\nSlatkin developed the ScentWorx brand using his years of experience and eying the mass market for distribution. He coined the word \u201cmasstige\u201d to describe his focus on bringing prestigious home and body fragrances to the masses. Using economies of scale and his fragrances, he boasts that he\u2019s able to deliver a high-quality, long-burn candle at a price comparable to other brands on the Walmart shelf.\n\n\u201cI got so tired of going into mass retailers and seeing so many products made by corporations that just stuck a label and price on weak-scented candles and called it a day,\u201d he said. \u201cWalmart is a great retailer, and I was so impressed with Walton\u2019s business savvy that I called them up and got a meeting with the home buyer.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with Walmart in 2024, Slatkin said the retailer brought in 20 candle scents for stores, and more are sold online. The ScentWorx candles sell for $13.98 for a 14.5-ounce candle that offers 40 hours of burn time. He said the candle smells consistently through the burn with a self-extinguished cotton wick. The candles hit store shelves in January.\n\nWalmart is not Slatkin\u2019s first mass retail sales deal. The HomeWorx brand is sold by Ulta, Nordstrom, Kohl\u2019s, and discounters like TJX. He developed Aroma Home for Home Depot.\n\nBy the end of 2023, Slatkin + Co. added 5,000 more stores with 3,000 more in 2024. By adding Walmart, CVS, and Dollar General, Slatkin + Co. grew revenue to nine figures by the end of 2024. Laura Slatkin also owns the luxury home fragrance brand Nest.\n\nSlatkin said he\u2019s happy to bring home fragrances, bath and body products, and soon car fragrances to Walmart. His Dwell212 brand of bath and body products, which Slatkin designed with his Generation Z (people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s) daughter in mind, will hit select Walmart shelves in mid-February. The body washes, hand soaps and fragrance mists range in price from $8 to $13.\n\n\u201cThe body wash, for example, is vegan, cruelty-free, aluminum-free, sulfate-free, paraben-free and SLS-free,\u201d Slatkin said. \u201cI created it with the younger consumer who wants to use a product daily, and there is a mental health element because scent is our most powerful sense. It changes the mood and feeds into the synapses in our body, changing our mood with it.\u201d\n\nSlatkin\u2019s car fragrance products should be on Walmart shelves in March. He said he takes pride in developing fragrance products for mass retailers.\n\n\u201cWhen you get into our world, mass customers have worked very hard for that money,\u201d Slatkin said. \u201cBut they also want and deserve quality products very similar to luxury brands but at a deep value.\u201d\n\nHe said consumers are smart and informed about what they want, and if retailers don\u2019t have what they want, it\u2019s very easy for them to find it online. He also said he develops all the scents for his fragrance brands but outsources the production.\n\n\u201cI do not manufacture anything in China and will not,\u201d he said. \u201cMy manufacturers are true professionals who use my formulations, and I oversee the entire process. I have an amazing team that works with us to bring our products to the market. My top fragrance developer has been with me for 32 years. We have a great passion for what we do, just like Sam Walton did.\u201d\n\nSlatkin said he burns his candles in his home and would not sell a product he didn\u2019t use. He said the ScentWorx products in Walmart are made in the U.S. and Dominican Republic.\n\nHe said the on-shelf look and branding are important in grabbing first-time shoppers\u2019 attention, but the quality of the burn and pricing is what gets them to come back.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers.

According to a study by ReFED, about 33% of food in the U.S., or 80 million tons, goes to waste each year. This means that a lot of food that is perfectly edible is being thrown away, while at the same time, one in 10 Americans are food insecure.\n\nThe resources required to grow, harvest, transport, cool, and prepare food are used even when the food ends up being disposed of, which is a huge waste of effort and energy.\n\nMoreover, when food waste ends up in landfills, it creates additional climate concerns. When food decomposes in landfills, it releases methane, a harmful gas that contributes to the Earth's overheating.\n\nIs Walmart doing anything about this?\n\nWalmart has previously pledged to reduce food waste through initiatives such as donating surplus food to charities and partnering with Feeding America.\n\nHowever, as this thread suggests, store-level execution of these policies may be inconsistent. Some locations reportedly work with food banks, while others discard food due to strict corporate policies or logistical challenges.\n\nWhat's being done about food waste more broadly?\n\nEfforts to combat food waste are gaining traction, with some states implementing laws requiring grocery stores to donate edible food instead of throwing it away.\n\nAdditionally, organizations like Food Rescue U.S. and Too Good To Go are working to redirect surplus food to those who need it most. Consumers can also help by supporting stores with strong food donation programs and reducing waste in their own households.\n\nWhile food safety regulations are essential, many believe more can be done to prevent large-scale waste, especially when hunger remains a critical issue. The conversation around Walmart's discarded food highlights the need for greater transparency and improved donation systems to ensure edible food doesn't go to waste.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

While prices for products such as apparel are now near pre-pandemic levels, food prices are still elevated.\n\nWalmart is seeing \u201cstress behaviors\u201d among budget-conscious consumers, \u201cand we worry about that,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cYou can see that the money runs out before the month is gone, you can see that people are buying smaller pack sizes at the end of the month.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that overall consumer behavior has remained consistent over the past year or so. Shoppers are being more selective and prioritizing value purchases.\n\nHigher prices for everything from beef and eggs to fuel present a challenge for retailers including Walmart, which has become one of the world\u2019s largest companies by offering \u201ceveryday low prices.\u201d The company recently projected lower-than-expected profit for the current fiscal year while citing uncertainty related to consumer behavior as well as economic and geopolitical conditions.\n\nOverall U.S. inflation in January jumped by the most since August 2023, driven in part by the cost of eggs. With bird flu killing millions of chickens, egg prices surged more than 15% from a month earlier, the biggest advance since 2015, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEgg prices were in January 55% higher than a year earlier, prompting President Donald Trump to label the situation \u201ca disaster.\u201d McMillon said he\u2019s in contact with his staff on the cost of eggs and how the retailer can provide relief to consumers. While prices for non-food items have declined, food prices haven\u2019t, with higher wages, input costs and other factors contributing, he added.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of income levels in this country \u2014 if you\u2019re at the lower end of that scale, you are feeling more frustration and pain because of higher food prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve persisted for years now, and you\u2019re just tired of it. And you want it to get better.\u201d\n\nLast year, Dollar General Inc. also warned that inflation was having a negative impact on lower-income shoppers, with a growing number unable to make their incomes cover their monthly expenses.\n\nTariffs risk\n\nThe U.S. is forecast to import more food than it exports for a third year, with the agriculture trade deficit expected to balloon to a record $49 billion this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Before the recent string of trade imbalances, the country only brought in more food than it shipped out in 2019 and 2020, during Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Trade deficits were also seen for several years prior to 1960. Walmart has said it\u2019s dealt with tariffs for years and has a diversified supply chain.\n\nWalmart\u2019s CEO said concerns about safety, taxes and the cost of property were among the factors that led the company to close half of its stores in Chicago. The locations, which were already losing money, were severely damaged during unrest in 2020, McMillon said.\n\n\u201cThat was another moment in time \u2014 \u2018do we reopen them, or, given that they lose money, do we just use this opportunity to say we just decided not to reopen?\u2019 he said. \u201cIt was a real debate inside the company, but a few of us, including me, wanted to try again.\u201d\n\nSafety concerns\n\nStill, the situation worsened after the stores reopened and Walmart lost even more money in Chicago, he said, with other locations subsidizing the unprofitable ones.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, I started to develop concerns about safety and security,\u201d he said.\n\nWalmart has been revamping its operations, including an expansion of its e-commerce operations, to fuel growth and fend off competition. Walmart offers more than 700 million items online and is heading toward an inventory of a billion, McMillon said.\n\nThe retailer is also upgrading its network of over 4,600 U.S. stores to make them more modern and easier to shop in. It\u2019s opening new locations while branching into newer areas like membership and advertising.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed the impact of Elon Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts on the US government and how action against smaller agencies such as USAID can translate into action against larger agencies and programs.\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\"But I do think that when the Defense Department is on the [inaudible], and then Medicare, Medicaid. I mean, Medicare, Medicaid, I don't know a soul who thinks that there isn't fat in there. And I also think that, kind of like the labor department, with the unemployment number we really don't know what it is we have big revisions, if we had, if we gave to Salesforce, I don't know. . .I think that, if we gave these companies, literally outsourced these companies, I know people are going to say, Jim you are like, that is so right wing, but if there's, the machines are better. . \"\n\nCramer also commented on recent Bitcoin price action which saw the cryptocurrency dip below the $90,000 mark. He linked Bitcoin as being a \"proxy for the fact that we have thirty-six trillion in debt.\" Cramer also wondered how much of the gain in Bitcoin's price was due to Michael Saylor's firm adding the currency to its balance sheet.\n\nCramer added that his team has concluded that so much of the \"froth\" in the market in untested areas such as quantum computing came from Bitcoin. He outlined: \"The reason why we've had so much froth . . .we think that Bitcoin got people very excited about things that are space age and that the fundament of speculation is Bitcoin. That's what turned it all on.\"\n\nAnother topic that caught the CNBC TV host's attention was the mergers and acquisition environment in the Trump administration. After the President's election victory in November, investors were ecstatic as they believed that the new administration could create a healthy environment for deals. Commenting on how the rules of the market still remained the same, Cramer outlined:",

            "content": "After moving into a new apartment, I fell victim to the same problem so many home chefs dread: a lack of cabinet space. Extra kitchen storage tops the list of most-desired home features. And with most of my cabinets too high off the ground for me to comfortably reach (yes, even with a step stool), I feared for the life of my favorite dishes.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m still reeling from the loss of two of my wine glasses during the move. Nevertheless, I needed a better storage solution\u2014one that would keep my dinnerware safe, but also give me a chance to display it stylishly. I lacked open shelves in my kitchen, so I opted for something even better: a bar cart turned into a buffet cabinet.\n\n\n\nPerfect for displaying in the kitchen or dining room, a buffet cabinet is like a more modern, miniature version of a china cabinet. But there was one that I was more familiar with than the rest, and for good reason: the BHG x Walmart Juliet Bar Cabinet.\n\nWalmart\n\nThe most fun element of the Juliet Bar Cabinet is its adjustable shelves\u2014and with a little creativity, that includes the wooden wine rack on the bar cabinet\u2019s base. Inspired by a Walmart review that claimed to have assembled the shelf without any of its typical bar cabinet features, I decided to do the same, transforming the piece from console to buffet table.\n\n\n\nFor just $118, it's a budget-friendly fit for any space. The shelves are spacious, but its overall size isn\u2019t overwhelming. It comes in two finishes: black and light honey. I went with the latter.\n\n\n\nI assembled it all by myself, and true to Walmart\u2019s word, it wasn't difficult. It took me a little over an hour to put it together, and if you have a second person to help you (or if you\u2019re over 5\u20194\u201d), you\u2019ll probably have an even easier time than I did.\n\n\n\nTo transform the cabinet into a buffet table, all you have to do is leave the two wooden wine rack pieces off the bottom of the shelf. Just set them to the side and ignore the instructions for those specific pieces. Once you\u2019re finished assembling the cabinet, you're left with an empty wooden shelf. You can discard the wooden wine racks or keep them for later if you think becoming a wine connoisseur is in your future.\n\n\n\nSophia Beams / BHG\n\nWhether you install the wine glass holders on the top of the shelf is totally up to you. In the end, I decided to pop them on. The wooden holders take up almost no space and add a whole lot of charm to the cabinet. Plus, using them gave me even more storage space.\n\n\n\nThe best part of the build is, of course, getting to style it. After I finished the buffet table, it was time to load up the shelves. I chose to make the top of the cabinet into a drinks station, complete with cute glasses and a coffee machine.\n\n\n\nInside, I stored my fine china, wine and cocktail glasses, coffee supplies, and tablescape extras. Leaving the wooden wine racks off the base of the shelf meant that I had an extra level to work with, giving me double the storage for my dining supplies.\n\n\n\nSophia Beams / BHG\n\nThe inside shelves are super sturdy, so I had no qualms about displaying my favorite dishes. The hinges are soft-close, so I don\u2019t have to worry about rattling my dishes (or disturbing my neighbors). It\u2019s also compact enough to provide a beautiful accent to my dining room without taking up too much space.\n\n\n\nTo me, the best part about the Juliet Bar Cabinet is its versatility. Double up on the bar carts and leave out the wine racks to create a TV console or trendy station for office supplies. You could even extend your kitchen by creating a full-on coffee bar counter, or use it as a striking storage solution for your living space.\n\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re filling its shelves with Anthropologie\u2019s iconic Icon glasses and World Market\u2019s sardine appetizer plates like me, or just dropping in a few of your favorite wine bottles and glasses, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to go wrong. My once-disorganized dining room has undergone an HGTV-style transformation thanks to this little buffet cabinet, and I think you'll find it helps you achieve a look that feels magical in your home, too.",

Spark Change. campaign to support the Feeding America network of partner food banks.\n\nThe annual donation campaign, running March 1-31, kicks off a celebration of 20 years of partnership between Walmart, Sam's Club and Feeding America that's grown into one of the most transformative collaborations in the hunger relief space \u2013 with approximately $271 million in donations \u2013 including more than $177 million from the company and the Walmart Foundation and nearly $95 million from customers and members. Walmart and Sam's Club have also donated more than 9 billion pounds of food to the Feeding America network of local food banks and partner agencies since 2006.\n\n\"Our extraordinary partnership is grounded in a shared belief that ending hunger in America is possible,\" said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, Feeding America's CEO. \"For two decades, Walmart and Sam's Club have brought bold, impactful ideas to the table, and executed them consistently and with purpose. We are grateful for all they've done and all that's to come.\"\n\nThe Fight Hunger. Spark Change. campaign will run online and in stores from March 1-March 31. Shoppers have three easy ways to support people facing hunger:\n\nFor every participating product purchased in store or online at Walmart.com or SamsClub.com, the supplier will donate the monetary equivalent of at least one meal* ($0.10) on behalf of a Feeding America partner food bank at Walmart and five meals* ($0.50) at Sam's Club, up to applicable limits.

Spark Change. campaign site at either www.FeedingAmerica.org/Walmart or www.FeedingAmerica.org/SamsClub.\n\nDuring the campaign, all donations stay local. Sales-activated supplier donations and register donations are directed to a local Feeding America partner food bank located within a store or club's community. Since its inception in 2014, the campaign has helped to secure nearly 2 billion meals* for people facing hunger.\n\n\"For the past 20 years, Feeding America, Walmart and Sam's Club have collaborated to help people live better in the communities we serve. Together, we have supported the charitable meal system's ability to recover more food donations from retailers and use tech-powered solutions that help food banks and agencies serve more people,\" said Julie Gehrki, president of the Walmart Foundation and senior vice president at Walmart. \"The Fight Hunger Spark Change. campaign is another way we build support for the fight against hunger by engaging our suppliers, customers and members to join us in giving to local food banks across the U.S.\"\n\nWalmart and Feeding America's partnership began in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when Walmart Foundation made a $1 million donation for disaster relief.\n\nIn addition to more disaster relief support \u2013 including major gifts in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024 \u2013 multi-year investments from Walmart and Walmart Foundation have helped fund Feeding America's efforts to maximize food sourcing and sharing, as well as to expand its capacity to source and distribute food more efficiently to households experiencing food insecurity.\n\nWalmart and the Walmart foundation have funded retail agency capacity grants totaling $15.75 million \u2013 including a $9.75 million donation in 2024 \u2013 that have reached more than 20 food banks and hundreds of partner agencies across the country. The grants expand retail donation programs and help fund personnel, equipment and transportation solutions that result in increased amounts of food distributed to partner agencies, including food pantries and meal programs.\n\nThose grants have helped equip programs like the Rolling Store Food Pantry, an agency partner of the Heart of Alabama Food Bank which has for years been operated out of a school bus in and around Montgomery, Alabama. With a recent grant, program lead Jeremy Lynch bought a refrigerated freezer trailer, allowing the group to safely transport more perishable donated food to distribution events in several rural counties.\n\n\"It's been a game changer for sure,\" Lynch said, noting the new trailer system helped distribute food to about 8,500 families in 2024. Beyond the increased frequency of pickups and pounds of food, the convenience of the new trailer affords Lynch and his fellow volunteers more capacity and more time to help their communities by standing up a sustainable program. \"These grants are making an impact that's far-reaching and that's something you can't really put a number to,\" he said.\n\nThe 24 participating suppliers for this year's Fight Hunger. Spark Change campaign for Walmart include: B&G Foods, Inc., Ben's Original, Bush Brothers & Company, Celsius, The Coca-Cola Company, Conagra Foods, Dole Packaged Foods, LLC, Ferrero USA, General Mills, Hershey Salty Snacks, Hidden Valley Original Ranch, Kellanova, Keurig Dr. Pepper, Kodiak, Kraft Heinz, Lipton Tea, Materne, Mondelez International, Olipop, Pepsi-Cola Advertising & Marketing, Inc. , The Hain Celestial Group, WK Kellogg Co, Unilever and Utz Quality Foods.\n\nThe six participating suppliers for Sam's Club include: General Mills, Kellanova, Kodiak, Kraft Heinz, Nestl\u00e9 and Unilever.\n\nTo learn more about the campaign, visit https://www.feedingamerica.org/campaigns/fight-hunger-spark-change.\n\n*Currently, $1 helps provide at least 10 meals secured by Feeding America\u00ae on behalf of local partner food banks.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nEmily James\n\nFeeding America\n\nAbout Feeding America\n\nFeeding America is committed to an America where no one is hungry.

With bird flu killing millions of chickens, egg prices surged more than 15% from a month earlier, the biggest advance since 2015, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nImage Trump\n\nEgg prices in January were 55% higher than a year earlier, prompting President Donald Trump to label the situation \u201ca disaster.\u201d McMillon said he\u2019s in contact with his staff on the cost of eggs and how the retailer can provide relief to consumers.

Before the recent string of trade imbalances, the country since the turn of the century only brought in more food than it shipped out in 2019 and 2020, during Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Trade deficits were also seen for several years before 1960. Walmart has said it\u2019s dealt with tariffs for years and has a diversified supply chain.\n\nSafety Concerns\n\nWalmart\u2019s CEO said concerns about safety, taxes and the cost of property were among the factors that led the company to close half of its stores in Chicago. The locations, which were already losing money, were severely damaged during unrest in 2020, McMillon said.\n\n\u201cThat was another moment in time \u2014 \u2018Do we reopen them, or, given that they lose money, do we just use this opportunity to say we just decided not to reopen?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a real debate inside the company, but a few of us, including me, wanted to try again.\u201d\n\nStill, the situation worsened after the stores reopened, and Walmart lost even more money in Chicago, he said, with other locations subsidizing the unprofitable ones.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, I started to develop concerns about safety and security,\u201d he said.\n\nExpand and Improve\n\nWalmart has been revamping its operations, including an expansion of its e-commerce operations, to fuel growth and fend off competition. Walmart offers more than 700 million items online and is heading toward an inventory of a billion, McMillon said.\n\nThe retailer also is upgrading its network of more than 4,600 U.S. stores to make them more modern and easier to shop in. It\u2019s opening new locations while branching into newer areas like membership and advertising.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing below or go here for more info:",

            "content": "A grassroots organization is calling on Americans to participate Friday in what it\u2019s calling the \"Feb. 28 economic blackout\" by refraining from buying goods from major retailers for 24 hours.\n\nThe nationwide protest comes amid rising prices on everything from gas to groceries \u2014 including, notably, eggs \u2014 and is similar to social media-fueled economic efforts that have cropped up online in recent months, including the \"No Buy 2025\" challenge against overconsumption.\n\nWho\u2019s behind the Feb. 28 blackout?\n\nThe Feb. 28 boycott is an initiative by the People's Union USA, a self-described \u201cgrassroots movement dedicated to economic resistance, government accountability and corporate reform.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group, founded by John Schwarz, says it is not affiliated with any political party. According to the organization\u2019s website, its goal is \u201cto unite Americans against the corruption and greed that has kept us struggling for decades.\u201d\n\nThe daylong boycott has been promoted online by several celebrities, including John Leguizamo, Stephen King and Bette Midler.\n\nWhat\u2019s the goal of the boycott?\n\n\"For our entire lives, they have told us we have no choice, that this is just how things are, that we have to accept these insane prices, the corporate greed, the billionaire tax breaks, all while we struggle just to get by,\" Schwarz said in a recent Instagram video. \u201cFor one day, we are going to finally turn the tables.\"'\n\nAccording to Schwarz, the idea is to halt all purchases from big corporations, both in store and online, from 12 a.m. through 11:59 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 28.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo Amazon, no Walmart, no fast food, no gas,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a single unnecessary dollar spent.\u201d\n\nWhat about medicine or emergency supplies?\n\nOn its website, the group is urging consumers to not spend money on \u201cnon-essential\u201d items.\n\nFor essential purchases like food, medicine, or emergency supplies, Schwarz is encouraging participants to buy them from a local small business rather than a big-box retailer.\n\n\"Do not go out and shop at any big, major store,\u201d Schwarz said in the video. \u201cIf you have to, go to the local pizza place, the small local boutique.\"\n\nBlackout targets all major retailers\n\nAmazon packages on a conveyor belt. (Ross D. Franklin/AP/File)\n\nSome supporters of the blackout have suggested boycotting specific corporations that have ended their diversity, equity and inclusion programs following President Trump\u2019s executive order targeting DEI initiatives. But while the People's Union calls the abandonment of DEI programs \u201cregressive and unacceptable,\u201d the Feb. 28 boycott is aimed at all major retailers, regardless of their stance on DEI.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we disrupt the economy for just ONE day, it sends a powerful message,\u201d the organization said on its website.\n\nIn a follow-up video posted on the eve of the planned blackout, Schwarz told his Instagram followers not to be discouraged if they see people shopping on Friday.\n\n\"Remember: There are 340 million people in America, and not all of them will stand with us,\" he said. \"But millions will.\"\n\nWhat happens after Feb. 28?\n\nSchwarz told USA Today earlier this month that he hopes to boycott other businesses \"that are really the biggest offenders within the system.\"\n\nThe People's Union is already planning weeklong blackouts aimed at specific retailers, including Amazon, Target and Walmart.\n\nThe first, targeting Amazon, is scheduled to begin March 7.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nWalmart has partnered with gaming platform Spatial on an interactive media series that allows players to purchase real-world goods from the retailer, according to a press release.\n\nWalmart Unlimited releases in three episodes, each brought to life through a blend of colorful animated scenes and video game levels. The story centers on tapping into superpowers and unlocking \u201cunlimited potential,\u201d featuring characters inspired by Walmart suppliers and Spatial users.\n\nThis is the first piece of Spatial content that weaves shopping capabilities into gameplay, aligning with Walmart\u2019s goal of offering \u201cfrictionless commerce\u201d experiences. The commerce hub is powered by Walmart\u2019s Unity Software Development Kit (SDK), which the retailer aims to implement into more games.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWalmart continues to step up its efforts to tie together e-commerce with gaming, a popular activity with valuable Gen Z consumers. The collaboration with Spatial, an 18-plus gaming platform, on Walmart Unlimited marks the first use of Walmart\u2019s Unity SDK, which the big-box store aims to integrate into future Spatial experiences and other independent video games built on the Unity engine. Unity\u2019s editor is used by some 1.2 million game developers monthly, potentially giving Walmart a wide reach. Walmart has dubbed these cross-channel commerce experiences as Adaptive Retail.\n\n\u201cGaming is one of the biggest forms of entertainment on earth, reaching more than 3 billion people spanning diverse backgrounds and interests,\u201d said Justin Breton, director of brand experience and partnerships at Walmart, in a statement. The executive added that \u201cUnity broadens our ability to engage with new customers by adding value to the gaming industry for both gamers and developers.\u201d\n\nWeb-based Walmart Unlimited has the look and feel of superhero media and throws a spotlight on Walmart suppliers. For example, one character is based on Ibraheem Basir, the founder of the Creole, Caribbean and Latin American-inspired food brand A Dozen Cousins. After users play through each episode of the trilogy, they can shop goods from featured suppliers through a dedicated in-game hub. The final two installments will be released in April and May.\n\nWalmart Unlimited was directed by animation studio Martian Blueberry and developed with the help of game studio Pigiama Kasama. The concept echoes past Walmart gaming initiatives, including experiences built for Roblox like an ambitious Universe of Play world that was wound down after six months. Walmart\u2019s gaming bets have received some pushback from advertising watchdogs that view these tactics as a way to stealthily market to children.\n\nWalmart Unlimited represents a new experiment for the big-box store but is part of its larger strategy of boosting online retail as it looks to stay competitive with Amazon. The company\u2019s global e-commerce sales rose 16% in the crucial fourth quarter, bolstered by U.S. marketplace growth.",

We\u2019ve even waxed poetic about one of the best laptop deals in tech \u2014 the Apple MacBook Air M1 \u2014 which is currently on sale. Walmart\u2019s latest deals aren\u2019t just on big ticket items, you can also find deals on Apple accessories like the Apple Pencil, Magic Keyboard, iPad Folio cases and more. If you need an Apple upgrade, act fast.\n\nSKIP AHEAD Best Apple deals at Walmart| More Apple sales to check out | Why trust NBC Select?\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nThe best Apple deals at Walmart\n\nThe AirPods Pro 2 is an NBC Select favorite. I\u2019ve used mine for over two years, and they\u2019re still working seamlessly. They\u2019re ideal for walking, running, commuting and taking calls. They also have up to six hours of listening time, according to Apple. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz says they are the best wireless earbuds for anyone with an iPhone. \u201cYou can use them to commute, workout, run or watch your favorite shows, they are above average at basically any task you throw at them,\u201d he says.\n\nThe M1 MacBook Air launched in 2020, but still delivers excellent performance in a compact size, especially at this price. NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez has used this model for years to tackle emails, spreadsheets, task management and streaming. I\u2019ve also used this MacBook Air as my main laptop and it\u2019s still chugging along without problems. I\u2019m able to stream shows and edit documents with very little issue. It\u2019s light, compact and gets up to 18 hours of battery life, according to the brand.\n\nThis iPad is a good fit for creatives and professionals looking to create. This is a great option if you want to draw sketches, take notes or edit photos. It also supports Apple Pencil Pro, which has much more advanced control than other Apple Pencils. It uses Apple\u2019s M2 chip, which has improved performance and Apple Intelligence support. It also has an anti-reflective, laminated screen with increased color depth and contrast.\n\n\u201cDespite constantly testing new smartwatches, the Apple Watch stubbornly remains on one of my wrists, at the very least to compare to other smartwatches,\u201d says Rabinowitz. The Series 10 model has a large, square, always-on display which allows you to comfortably see a lot of text on screen at once. The Series 10 gets up to 18 hours of battery life and has all new sleep apnea notifications.\n\nWhile testing the Apple AirTag, I brought it to Japan. I could easily find my luggage because the AirTag sends a Bluetooth signal that your iPhone can detect. When you\u2019re near the tracker, you can use its Precision Finding feature, which guides you toward your item, using an arrow that points you in the AirTag\u2019s direction. The AirTag is about the size of a quarter, making it easy to place in your wallet or attach to a bag. The setup process is incredibly simple and it takes seconds to pair with your Apple device.\n\n\u201cThe Apple Watch SE is an excellent first smartwatch \u2014 it was mine,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cIt\u2019s much lower priced than Apple\u2019s other wearables, yet has almost all the same features. You can still send texts, take calls and use Siri. It also pairs with Apple\u2019s Health and Fitness apps to track workout performance, sleep quality, heart rate and more.\n\nThis previous generation of the AirPods still packs a punch and is worth your time, especially on a discount. It has up to six hours of listening time with up to 30 hours of additional time with the case. You can currently get them on sale for $40 off.\n\nMore sales to check out:\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI am an editor at NBC Select who writes and edits stories on various topics including tech, fitness, home and more.

            "content": "Thirteen years ago, I was working as a cashier in a candy store. I wasn\u2019t making enough to pay rent so slept in my car in a Walmart parking lot.\n\nIt was really tough, I\u2019m not going to lie. I saw no way out of that parking lot. But then I got thrown a lifeline. I landed a temp job separating aluminum and steel scrap at a local manufacturing plant where my grandfather was a production manager.\n\nFrom Day 1, I sensed something different about the company, AMBAC International, which makes fuel injection systems for heavy-duty commercial and military use. Folks were way more interested in a 20-year-old kid with no clue and no professional skill set than I ever would have imagined. Even though I was just a temp separating scrap metal, they took time to explain the company to me, to take me on the shop floor and show me the ropes.\n\nPower of ESOPs\n\nI put my head down, worked hard and got hired full time. I quickly realized the reason everyone was so invested in me was because they owned the company. That\u2019s right, AMBAC is partly owned by its employees, through an employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, which provides tax incentives to companies that share ownership with employees. It\u2019s one of about 6,500 ESOP companies in the country, according to the National Center for Employee Ownership.\n\nAt most jobs, I would have been trained for my daily duties and that would have been that. But because of the ESOP, my coworkers invested so much time into me becoming stronger professionally. I\u2019m talking about the workers on the shop floor, not just management. I may not have been eligible for the ESOP as a temp worker, but from the minute I started, they saw the connection between my work and their wallets. Everyone wants the company to do better, because when it does, their ESOP accounts grow in value.\n\nI was trained to have a holistic view of the company and how we operate and learned how all the details of everyone\u2019s jobs intertwined. The mentality that everyone is as strong as everyone else from the shop floor up to leadership was drilled into me. My previous experience handling finances was limited to the candy store cash register, but once I started full time, I got comprehensive financial training, sitting with a more tenured employee to learn what each line of the P&L meant and how the daily duties of each employee affected those numbers.\n\nWhen COVID hit, our business dried up. Many companies were furloughing employees and making layoffs, but we got together and did everything we could to keep everyone working full time, including dropping our landscaping company and buying a lawnmower. Years before COVID, we decided not to take an annual raise and instead put that money into buying new machinery. It was a decision all 52 employees made together because we were lacking in a certain capacity that was harming our bottom line.",

The world's biggest retailer has a \"better chance than most competitors of minimizing\" the impacts of tariffs on consumers because it can \"get the best deals from suppliers.\" Given those advantages, the company probably wanted to \"under-promise in the hope of overdelivering\" on profits. Still, it's worth noticing the \"tariff clouds on the horizon.\"\n\n\"Shoppers have flooded\" into Walmart during the post-pandemic inflation crisis, said Nathaniel Meyersohn at CNN. But other retailers have \"less leverage and may have to raise prices for consumers\" as tariffs kick in. Walmart's own sales remain relatively strong for now, but its warning to investors of a \"slower 2025\" is a \"bad sign for America's economy,\" Meyersohn said. And it's a \"signal for the rest of the retail industry that 2025 will be a rockier year.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\nWalmart's guidance to investors \"may have more to do with weight-loss drugs \" than Trump's tariffs, said MarketWatch . The company has acknowledged that the sale of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy have \"slightly helped sales for their pharmacy businesses,\" said Modern Retail . The problem is that research shows consumers \"cut their grocery spending by about 6%\" after they start taking the drugs. That can lead to big drops in the sales of \"calorie-dense, processed items like chips.\"",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWalmart is planning a broader rollout of AI-powered coding assistance and completion tools after experiencing early wins, executives said during the company\u2019s Q4 2025 earnings call Thursday .\n\nLast year, the tools helped the retailer save about 4 million developer hours by streamlining deployments and delivering code faster with fewer bugs, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said. Walmart plans to make the tools available to all developers in North America and India this year .\n\n\u201cAs we become more productive and reduce the amount of time we work on routine tasks, that gives us time to develop tools that help us grow the business and move faster,\u201d McMillon said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWalmart moved quickly to embrace generative AI. The company took a \u201cdiverge, then converge\u201d approach to the technology as it transitioned from discovery to execution, sister site CIO Dive reported last year.\n\nPart of Walmart\u2019s shift in approach to AI centered on narrowing its scope. Companies that implemented an AI strategy, built advanced capabilities and began to realize benefits last year took a similar approach, according to BCG data. Leading organizations pursued about half as many AI projects compared with less advanced businesses, BCG research found.\n\nWalmart leaned into expanding generative AI access and using the technology to enhance customer and associate experiences. The retailer boosted the adoption of its internal generative AI tool, My Assistant. Now, Walmart is increasing the amount of developers using coding tools. It also used the technology to improve data hygiene to better search and discovery capabilities, ultimately leading to CX wins.\n\nDespite rising enterprise disillusionment with AI last year, most companies continued to prioritize the technology.\n\nWhile more than 4 in 5 IT decision-makers say their company progressed toward AI goals last year, returns were harder to come by, according to an IBM report. Most businesses yet to reach ROI expect cost savings to occur within three years, and around 44% anticipate turning the corner sooner.\n\nFor some businesses, the sustained efforts have already begun to pay off. General Mills executives credited the food manufacturer\u2019s AI projects with driving millions in cost-savings, during a conference earlier this week. Financial services company Charles Schwab tied expanded AI use to trimmed costs, too.\n\nAI agents are the latest frontier enterprises are exploring on the path to unlock efficiencies and improve experiences. Two-thirds of organizations are pursuing AI agents already, BCG research found. Walmart said it is using an AI agent to help merchants identify the root cause of issues related to supply management.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got opportunities to save money, get faster and we\u2019re making fluid decisions about how much we invest in technology,\u201d McMillon said.\n\nWalmart\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue was up 4.1%, totaling $180.6 billion. Its e-commerce business and grocery segment saw growth as well, but the retailer warned of slower profit growth this fiscal year.",

At the moment, Walmart is not setting a limit on egg purchases by customers, with the only exception being a 60-count package.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to provide surety of supply for our customers so that they can come and get the items that they want,\u201d Walmart CFO John David Rainey told FOX Business. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate to be able to do that, thus far.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rainey, Walmart is doing everything it can to meet demand by working with suppliers. For now, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has committed to keeping prices low regardless of supply pressure from the widespread avian flu cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart rival Whole Foods is limiting egg purchases to three cartons per customer. According to the Amazon-owned store, difficulties in getting eggs that meet animal welfare requirements are putting supply in jeopardy.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s has also put a strict limit on egg sales. Currently, only one, 12-egg carton per shopper is allowed per day.\n\nEgg Shortages Impacting More Than Walmart and Other Retailers\n\nThe egg shortage is not only affecting retailers like Walmart. With limited supply and uncertainty about future orders, restaurants across the country are being forced to raise prices on dishes that use eggs.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, breakfast-focused Waffle House added a 50-cent surcharge on each egg served. Diners were met with an explanation of the extra charge on a sticker adhered to the menu at Waffle House locations nationwide.\n\n\u201cWhen shortages like this happen, operators work closely with their food suppliers to determine how it will impact them,\u201d said the National Restaurant Association\u2019s Sean Kennedy, per FOX Business. \u201cThere are several options operators consider, from changing their menus to increasing their prices.\u201d\n\nIn January, egg prices reached an all-time high, with the average price per dozen hitting $4.95. In contrast, consumers could buy 12 eggs for $2.04 in August 2023.\n\nAccording to a projection released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the cost of eggs will continue to climb this year. The agency expects a 20% increase in price and continued shortages as the market recovers from the bird flu pandemic.",

The upgrade improved investor sentiment on the stock to the point where it ended the trading day more than 4% higher in value. This was a particularly good performance when matched against that of the S&P 500 index, which closed almost 0.5% lower that day.\n\nRecommendation upgrade\n\nWell before market open, DZ Bank's Mike Pohn changed his recommendation on Walmart stock to buy from his previous hold. He set his price target for the prominent retail stock at $110 per share, which is nearly 13% higher than its most recent closing price.\n\nThe reasons for Pohn's move weren't immediately apparent. It surely isn't coincidental that it came only several trading days after Walmart released its final set of fiscal 2025 results, however.\n\nIn the company's fourth quarter, it managed to grow its revenue by 4% year over year to almost $181 billion while improving non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) by 10% to $0.66. Both figures edged past the consensus analyst estimates.\n\nA proven performer and a dividend raiser\n\nStocks trade on future expectations rather than trailing performance, however, and that's where Walmart fell short in its earnings report. It guided for adjusted EPS of $2.50 to $2.60 for the entirety of fiscal 2026, a range that didn't come close to the average analyst estimate of $2.77 for the year.\n\nI'm not sure I'd let a single guidance miss dissuade me from putting money into one of the most successful retail operations of all time. I feel Walmart, with its talent for pushing sales and profitability ever higher, will continue to improve its fundamentals well into the future. It should also continue remunerating shareholders, as evidenced by the 13% dividend raise it declared last week.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 7 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWalmart recently expanded its real estate portfolio with a $34 million purchase.\n\nHowever, the type of property the retailer bought gave some industry experts and observers pause. That\u2019s because Walmart bought the Monroeville Mall, a more than 50-year-old shopping center near Pittsburgh with over 100 operating businesses.\n\nTo several industry experts and analysts, the retailer made a smart move \u2014 the Monroeville Mall offers an attractive real estate parcel that\u2019s already set up for retail use. It also gives Walmart a measure of control on what businesses operate in the center.\n\n\u201cThis move aligns with broader retail trends where major players are rethinking how they use real estate, especially as traditional malls struggle with declining foot traffic,\u201d Jonathan Zhang, a professor at Colorado State University's College of Business, told Retail Dive in an email. \u201cWalmart could see this as an opportunity to repurpose underperforming malls into mixed-use spaces with a strong retail anchor \u2014 whether that\u2019s a supercenter, a fulfillment hub or a combination of both.\"\n\nIf this strategy works in Pittsburgh, the company may try it again elsewhere, tapping into underperforming malls with prime locations, Zhang noted.\n\nWalmart is working with Texas-based Cypress Equities to lead the redevelopment process, which includes the mall proper and an annex building of additional retail stores. Beyond that, Walmart isn\u2019t offering many details on its plans.\n\nIn response to questions from Retail Dive, the retailer said it didn\u2019t have anything to add beyond a statement it provided earlier this month confirming the mall\u2019s purchase. In that statement, Walmart said in part that it \u201cis very interested in being part of any future redevelopment of this site\u201d and working alongside Cypress on operations and potential redevelopment plans.\n\nA good deal for a small investment\n\nA ready-to-go parcel of real estate for $34 million represents a modest investment for Walmart, which reported $681 billion in revenue for its most recent fiscal year. In its latest earnings statement, the company reported $260 billion in total assets. Nearly $120 billion of that figure was property and equipment.\n\n\u201cI don't think they have any interest in the mall itself. I think it's a real estate deal,\u201d Nick Egelanian, president of SiteWorks, a retail development firm not connected with the deal, told Retail Dive.\n\nRather than a desire to get into the mall landlord business, Egelanian said it appears the price was right for a site they wanted \u2014 the mall operation is a fringe benefit. From a logistical or financial point of view, it\u2019s generally easier for companies to redevelop existing retail parcels, according to Zhang.\n\nThat process comes with advantages such as favorable zoning and fewer regulatory hurdles versus starting from scratch, Zhang said. \u201cThere\u2019s also an efficiency factor \u2014 utilities and transportation access are already in place, which can save millions in development costs.\u201d\n\nEven if some challenges arise, such as dealing with existing leases or needing to update outdated infrastructure, the cost-benefit equation often favors redevelopment, Zhang said.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, noted that the mall\u2019s purchase price is \u201ca relatively small investment\u201d for a company of Walmart\u2019s size. The retailer may have a redevelopment vision that includes a new Walmart store or might be testing ways to diversify its revenue streams with property ownership, Saunders said in an email to Retail Dive.\n\n\u201cThe latter is not all that unusual as Ikea, for example, owns a lot of shopping malls and has a big real estate business. It is also the case that Walmart has been looking beyond its core retail business for avenues to bolster growth,\u201d Saunders said.\n\nFor Zhang, buying a mall gives Walmart a three-point redevelopment head start.\n\n\u201cFirst, the location is already a proven commercial hub with built-in infrastructure \u2014 roads, utilities, and parking \u2014 all of which would take time and money to develop from scratch on an empty parcel,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cSecond, the mall already has tenants and customer traffic, which means Walmart can generate rental income while planning its redevelopment.\u201d\n\nFinally, such a move allows Walmart to control a high-traffic retail space instead of competing for it, according to Zhang. That lets the company shape the future of the property to align with long-term business goals.\n\nStill, mall-related real estate is often complicated and the future of malls is in question. Yet, the popular narrative on mall performance \u2014 that many are dying or dead \u2014 is shifting as visits at indoor and outdoor malls rise, according to recent data from Placer.ai. Visits in January rose 5.5% for indoor malls, nearly 3% for open-air shopping centers and 2.7% for outlet malls from a year ago.\n\nPerformance also largely depends on the property. Class A malls are seeing more robust demand than Class B or Class C mall spaces, according to a recent JLL report, and lifestyle centers continue to do the best. Overall, though, malls have the highest vacancy rate across property types.\n\nBut the performance of malls does not rest solely with the owner. Because anchor stores often own their own buildings and land, developers might be required to buy out the contract of an operating department store before it can shut down.\n\nIf or when stores close, the legal encumbrances around redevelopment sometimes disappear with them, Egelanian said. As a result, a depressed mall lacking a robust roster of high-performing stores is often a good deal because there are fewer legal hurdles blocking redevelopment plans. It\u2019s a good time to be a buyer as well. According to JLL, current market conditions present an opportunity for investors to acquire retail properties below their replacement costs\n\nRetail is an inherently complex industry and companies that branch too far away from their core strengths tend to fail, Egelanian said. As a result, the industry will be watching closely to see how Walmart handles the Monroeville Mall.",

They\u2019re most likely to cut back on full-service restaurants (45%), followed closely by fast food restaurants (44%) and travel (44%). Conversely, they\u2019re less likely to cut back on grocery stores (29%), beauty/personal care (28%), and gasoline (20%) \u2013 however, this still represents a significant share of consumers scaling back. Though they are cutting back across many categories, they are less likely than the Gen Pop to reduce spending on clothing and shoes, presenting an opportunity for the big-box retailer.\n\nData also shows that just over three-quarters of Walmart\u2019s favorable shoppers are at least \u2018somewhat\u2019 concerned about the impact of recent trade policies and tariffs on household expenses, with 39% expressing they are \u2018very\u2019 concerned. Compared to shoppers at other major brick-and-mortar retailers, Walmart\u2019s favorable customers are more likely to express strong concerns than customers of Home Depot and Walgreens. However, concern is higher among CVS and Costco consumers, who are more likely than Walmart shoppers to be \u2018very\u2019 concerned about the effects of tariffs.\n\nUse this Data: The press, brands, and marketers can use this chart to understand how potential tariff concerns could impact future household spending.\n\nOverall, as the largest U.S. retailer and a key player in budget-conscious shopping, Walmart\u2019s outlook serves as a strong indicator of broader consumer sentiments.

A dominant AI chip maker, Nvidia's stock price is rallying again after a reported $26 billion revenue in QI, hitting more than $1,000 per share.\n\nU.S. stocks slid after discount retail giant Walmart issued a weaker-than-expected outlook, prompting consumer spending and tariff concerns.\n\nWalmart shares slumped 6.5% after the retail giant topped earnings estimates for the last three months of the year but expected a slowdown in earnings growth this fiscal year. The retailer serves as a barometer for consumer spending due to its scale and commanding market share of the U.S. retail industry. Investors watch its earnings closely for hints about U.S. economic health.\n\nWalmart also said it hasn't factored new tariffs into its outlook since it's not sure President Donald Trump's tariffs will go into effect next month, but it's cautious about the global outlook. Although about two-thirds of what Walmart sells is made, grown or assembled in the U.S., and it said it has experience navigating tariffs, it said it wouldn't be completely immune to broad tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods.\n\nAfter two consecutive days of record closes, the broad S&P 500 index slipped 0.43%, or 26.63 points, to 6,117.52; the blue-chip Dow fell 1.01%, or 450.94 points, to44,176.65; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.47%, or 93.89 points, to 19,962.36. The benchmark 10-year yield eased to 4.507%.\n\nSafe-haven gold jumps to record high\n\nGold prices continued to soar to record highs. Gold is seen as a safe-haven during times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday he will announce fresh tariffs over the next month or sooner, adding lumber and forest products to previously announced plans to impose duties on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\nConstant tariff threats are keeping investors and the Federal Reserve on tenterhooks. Most economists say if all the tariffs Trump has threatened come to fruition, they will reignite inflation, cutting the chances for more Fed rate cuts. Already, many economists have trimmed or erased odds for additional rate cuts this year.\n\nGold prices were last up 0.57% at $2,952.70 per ounce, off a record high of $2,954.69 hit earlier in the day. The yellow metal has gained more than 12% so far this year.\n\nJobless data don't reflect federal layoffs yet\n\nMarkets shrugged off a slightly larger-than-expected rise in weekly jobless claims. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 219,000 for the week ended February 15, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 claims for the latest week.\n\nEconomists said the weekly jobs data don't yet reflect the mass layoffs of federal government workers.\n\n\"It is too soon for these layoffs to be reflected in the claims data, but we will be monitoring the claims figures in the weeks ahead for federal workers for an indication of the magnitude of these layoffs,\" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics\n\nCorporate news\n\nOther corporate movers, aside from Walmart, include:\n\nCarvana's results from the last few months of the year topped analysts' forecasts. But the car-selling platform's shares dropped more than 12% after its revenue per vehicle sold retail declined.\n\nChinese ecommerce firm Alibaba beat quarterly earnings forecasts. Separately, GameStop chief executive Ryan Cohen raised his personal stake in Alibaba to roughly 7 million shares worth about $1 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Alibaba shares rose more than 8%.\n\nHasbro reported earnings in the last three months of the year above analysts' estimates but expected revenues this year to fall below forecasts due to weaker demand for toys like Star Wars action figures and Nerf guns. But the small annual gain accounts for expected U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports and potential duties on imports from Mexico and Canada. Shares gained almost 8%.\n\nPalantir, which supplies data-analytics services for defense agencies, saw its stock slide more than 5% after reports of potential U.S. defense budget cuts. The company's chief executive also adopted a new stock-trading plan.\n\nShake Shack shares rallied more than 11% after the fast-food chain posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin prices edged up after Trump emphasized again at a conference Wednesday his commitment to making America the world's crypto hub.\n\nBitcoin was last up 1.73% at $98,315.54.\n\nThis story was updated with new information.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

It came with Walmart shares hitting record highs. He noted historical trends pointed to an eventual shift back to service from convenience and price.\n\nBut now Simon thinks the economic and geopolitical backdrop is so unprecedented, higher-income consumers may shop at Walmart permanently.\n\n\"If you liked that story yesterday before the earnings release, you should love it today because it's... cheaper,\" said Simon.\n\nWalmart stock is now down 10% from its all-time high hit on Feb. 14.

Amazon, for the first time, notched a stronger fourth quarter revenue and is projected to take the lead in sales this year as it leans harder into AI and web services, CNBC reported.\n\n30% of Walmart's online shoppers pay to not wait\n\nThe company said nearly a third of e-commerce shoppers pay a fee to get delivery within a one- or three-hour window on items like groceries and pharmacy prescriptions.\n\nLast year, that number was zero, since it was only introduced in March.\n\nWalmart's ability to achieve this ultrafast same-day service is driven largely by its fleet of more than 4,600 US stores, which are within a short drive of 93% of US households.\n\n\"If I could change anything about how we're perceived today, it would be that more people know about our breadth of assortment online and are increasing delivery speed,\" CEO Doug McMillon said on the earnings call Thursday.\n\nRelated stories\n\n4 million developer hours\n\nWalmart said its AI-enabled coding assistants and completion tools saved developers approximately 4 million hours last year.\n\nAgain, that number was nearly zero a year ago.\n\nIt's just one among several ways the 63-year-old retailer is morphing into a formidable 21st-century technology company, with an expanding e-commerce marketplace, growing advertising business, and an increasingly automated supply chain.\n\n\"As we become more productive and reduce the amount of time we work on routine tasks that gives us time to develop tools that help us grow the business and move faster,\" McMillon said.\n\nWith Amazon nipping at its heels, the Walmart of 2025 is fast becoming much more than your grandad's Superstore.",

So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Walmart\n\nNYSE:WMT Earnings and Revenue Growth February 22nd 2025\n\nAfter the latest results, the 28 analysts covering Walmart are now predicting revenues of US$701.1b in 2026. If met, this would reflect an okay 2.9% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to rise 8.6% to US$2.63. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$705.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.74 in 2026. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.\n\nThe consensus price target held steady at US$108, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Walmart, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$120 and the most bearish at US$58.00 per share. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Walmart's past performance and to peers in the same industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Walmart's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2026 expected to display 2.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 5.2% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 4.7% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Walmart.",

Cheddar\n\nPenny-pinching Walmart WMT.N shoppers focus much more on getting the lowest prices than on whether products are made in the U.S., Canada, China or elsewhere, Walmart executives have said.\n\nWhen Walmart discloses results on Thursday, the chain of more than 4,600 U.S. stores is likely to show that it rang up record annual sales, according to LSEG estimates.\n\nWalmart revenue rose by roughly 5% to $680.47 billion for the year ending January 31, 2025, according to LSEG estimates ahead of the results.\n\nBut some Walmart investors worry its bargain-price-above-all approach leaves the retailer in a bind under President Donald Trump as he slaps new tariffs on goods made in China and threatens them on products made in India, Mexico and Canada.\n\nWalmart is among the first big U.S. retailers to report results for the fourth quarter, including holiday season sales.\n\nThe retailer serves as a barometer for consumer spending due to its scale and commanding market share of the U.S. retail industry. Investors watch its earnings closely for hints about U.S. economic health.\n\nAlso the largest U.S. importer of containerized goods, Walmart generates 40% of its sales from discretionary merchandise like clothing, electronics and toys, items sourced primarily from China, India and other nations targeted by Trump's new tariffs.\n\nWalmart self-checkout: How retailer's DIY lanes don't check out with some shoppers\n\nFor the current year, Wall Street analysts expect Walmart's revenue growth rate to slow to 4%, hinting at anxiety over tariffs.\n\nA Walmart spokesperson declined to comment, saying the company was in its quiet period ahead of its earnings report.\n\nBrian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, a Walmart investor, said he will look at Walmart's Great Value in-house brand as a yardstick to measure the impact of tariffs. Mulberry noted that China is the source of over 70% of the household and generic non-food products that Great Value sells such as electronics, accessories, plastic food containers and sporting goods.\n\n\"We will be watching for any pressure on margins on the Great Value and other in-house brands as they have been responsible for adding positive growth to bottom line margins,\" Mulberry said.\n\nIn an annual filing in April 2024, Walmart warned: \"Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\"\n\nInvestors such as Randy Hare, director of research at Huntington Private Bank, a Walmart investor, are concerned whether results will show this \"adverse effect\" on its business.\n\n\"We are listening intently to see what guidance they give surrounding this,\" said Hare, who expects any impacts to be minimal. He cited Walmart's success in maintaining margin growth over the past few years, which included periods of high inflation and port strikes.\n\nWalmart has maintained its profit margins by reducing reliance on China, increasing warehouse automation, and relocating white-collar jobs to lower-cost areas like Arkansas.\n\nWalmart has also committed to invest $350 billion over 10 years to source products from suppliers that make, grow or assemble in the U.S., to help it save costs by shortening lead times and keeping shelves better stocked.\n\n\"I don't want price increases to put pressure on sales growth, so a balanced approach is needed,\" Hare said, explaining he would like Walmart to share tariff costs with suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nWalmart's current-year sales growth forecast of 4% growth exceeds that of rival Target TGT.N, which sources much of its inventory internationally, with China being its largest source, S&P analysts wrote in a note.\n\nTotal annual revenue for Target, which reports holiday quarter results on March 4, is estimated to decline about 1% in 2024 and rise by 2.5% in 2025, according to LSEG estimates.\n\nUBS analyst Michael Lasser, who last week raised his price target on Walmart's stock to $113 from $100, said that while Trump's election boosted inflationary pressures with new tariffs and immigration policies, Walmart's everyday low-price strategy would likely drive shoppers to spend more there.\n\n\"We believe Walmart would be one of the better positioned retailers to mitigate or manage through tariffs, given its price leadership, buying power, and global sourcing capabilities,\" Lasser said.\n\nReporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York and Savyata Mishra in Bangalore; Editing by David Gregorio",

Shares were relatively unchanged in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nThe session was a new, unwelcome development in the Walmart story.\n\nFor much of 2025, Walmart investors only saw a stock price that went up and to the right as it consistently beat analyst profit estimates and raised guidance. The impressive 2024 run has taken shares to a rich valuation of 37 times estimated forward earnings, a stiff premium relative to the 22 times afforded the S&P 500.\n\nBut with tariff and consumer spending concerns swirling, Walmart's profit outlook was lacking.\n\nThe company projected full-year earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.60. Analysts were modeling for $2.76 a share.\n\n\"We're not immune to this [tariffs], but we typically will work with suppliers on this. We'll shift supply where we need to. We can lean into our private brands. There's a lot of tools that we have that to try to keep those prices low for customers,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?\n\nThe Street has largely defended Walmart's stock in the aftermath of the sell-off, opting to reiterate bullish ratings and price targets. EPS estimates have started to trend lower, Yahoo Finance data shows, but still remain well above the company's guidance.\n\n\"This company is consistent, and the consumer is consistent, so it's [Walmart] well positioned for a beat-and-raise,\" TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. \"We certainly like it for the longer term.\"\n\nHere's what Wall Street is whispering about after the 2025 outlook from Walmart.\n\nCiti analyst Paul Lejuez\n\nRating: Reiterated Buy\n\nPrice Target: $120, reiteration\n\n\"The 'Walmart winning' theme continues, though high market expectations and 2025 guidance that was weaker than consensus weighed on the stock. But nothing has changed. Walmart US continues to gain share in all income cohorts (though led by higher income consumers), driven not only by Walmart's mindshare for value but also its convenience.\n\n\"Higher growth businesses such as marketplace, fulfillment and advertising are increasingly contributing to profits and will help drive margins in the future (and we believe Walmart can exceed historical peak EBIT margins). We believe 2025 guidance will prove conservative as was the case in 2024, and believe Walmart is positioned to outperform in the uncertain macroeconomic environment.\"",

The proposed class action lawsuit, filed on Jan. 31, accuses Target of defrauding shareholders into paying inflated prices for its stock while unknowingly supporting the misuse of investor funds to serve political and social goals.\n\nThe lawsuit also accuses Target of failing to disclose the risks of shifting its stance on DEI and REACH initiatives.\n\n24-hour DEI boycott set for Feb. 28\n\nThe fallout from Target\u2019s decision regarding DEI and REACH has been significant. The retailer, along with top competitor Walmart, has faced ongoing criticism from shoppers, celebrities, and officials on social media.\n\nA 24-hour boycott of Target, Walmart, and other retailers that have backtracked on DEI policy has been scheduled for Feb. 28. Organized by a group called The People\u2019s Union USA, the \u201c24-Hour Economic Blackout\u201d urges shoppers to support local, small businesses from midnight on Feb. 27 to Feb. 28. The group is also calling for an Amazon boycott from March 7 to March 14.\n\nRelated:5 things: Playing possum (with a Costco cake)\n\nWalmart shareholders: both for and against DEI\n\nWalmart shareholders are largely expressing support for the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer. A letter written in late November by the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom and signed by 60 Walmart investors, advisors, and proxy consultants, encouraged the retailer to stand by its decision to scale back DEI and LGBTQ initiatives, according to Fox News.\n\nBut this letter came on the heels of another\u2014this one signed by 30 Walmart shareholders who called the pivot away from DEI and LGBTQ policies a poor one. A group of 13 Democratic state attorneys general expressed similar sentiment in a separate letter sent to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.\n\nWill more lawsuits follow?\n\nAll the legal action stemming from retailers\u2019 DEI pullbacks is expected, according to analysts who spoke with Supermarket News, and future lawsuits may also target retailers like Costco for retaining their DEI policies.\n\n\u201cRetailers rolling back their DEI commitments are making their employees, customers, and businesses vulnerable to costly litigation,\u201d Shaun Harper, a professor of business, public policy, and education at the University of Southern California, told SN. \u201cSome lawyers believe that maintaining DEI initiatives actually makes companies more susceptible to lawsuits.\u201d\n\nRelated:Kroger to lay off some 200 corporate employees\n\nTarget and Walmart, however, may reverse course again in a few months.\n\n\u201cI imagine they\u2019ll probably stick with their decision until the winds change, until it becomes fashionable to focus on DEI again,\u201d Marcus Collins, clinical assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said. \u201cThe strongest brands transcend their category and operate at an ideological level, but when you backpedal or step back from what you said you were all about, it reduces you to just a place.\u201d",

The e-commerce giant achieved a record-breaking revenue of $680.985 billion, surpassing its previous year\u2019s performance. This equates to an average daily income of about $1.86 billion.\n\nAmid this financial success, how will Walmart move toward its climate and net zero goals?\n\nProfits Soar While Sustainability Goals Stall?\n\nWalmart posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.66 and revenue of $180.55 billion for Q4. This exceeded analyst predictions of $0.64 EPS and $180.31 billion in revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth was significantly driven by its online business, which saw a 16% increase in sales during the 4th quarter. Despite a 4.1% rise in sales for the quarter, net profit experienced a slight decline of 4.4%, amounting to $5.254 billion.\n\nComparable sales for Walmart U.S. increased by 4.6%, driven by a 16% growth in global e-commerce. Additionally, the giant retailer\u2019s advertising sector reported a robust 29% growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s competitive pricing strategy attracted a diverse customer base. These include higher-income shoppers seeking value amid economic uncertainties.\n\nHowever, the largest retailer is being careful about the next fiscal year. They expect only slight sales growth and earnings per share that could be as much as 27 cents lower than what analysts predicted. This cautious outlook stems from possible consumer reluctance and the effects of tariffs on imports from China and elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Walmart\u2019s shares experienced a decline of up to 7.8%. Analysts worry about a potential drop in consumer spending. This concern comes from post-holiday spending trends and inflation caused by protectionist trade policies.\n\nWalmart faces challenges, but it stays focused. It uses its size to improve online and in-store options, helping it keep its edge in retail.\n\nAnalysts are still hopeful about Walmart\u2019s market share growth and solid business trends. They do have worries about e-commerce profits and ongoing investments. The company focuses on competitive pricing. This strategy attracts many customers and helps it thrive in an uncertain economy.\n\nBut how does the e-commerce giant advance its sustainability and climate goals? Its latest report says Walmart is lagging behind its climate targets. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the company\u2019s sustainability efforts.\n\nWalmart\u2019s Net Zero and Sustainability Initiatives\n\nWalmart continues to show commitment to environmental impact. So, it has started many initiatives to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and boost sustainability in its operations and supply chain.\n\nCommitment to Net Zero Emissions\n\nIn 2020, Walmart announced its ambitious goal to achieve zero emissions across its global operations by 2040. This commitment encompasses a comprehensive strategy that does not rely on carbon offsets. To reach this objective, the company has outlined several key focus areas:\n\nRenewable Energy Transition : Walmart aims to power 100% of its global operations with renewable energy sources by 2035. By 2024, the company stated that about 36% of its operations used renewable energy. This shows steady progress toward its goal.\n\nFleet Electrification : Transportation is a significant contributor to GHG emissions. Walmart has set a target to electrify its entire vehicle fleet, including long-haul trucks, by 2040. This initiative is expected to substantially decrease emissions associated with product distribution and logistics.\n\nRELATED: Amazon\u2019s $1 Billion Move Towards Net Zero: Logistics Electrification Across Europe\n\nProject Gigaton: Supply Chain Emission Reductions\n\nWalmart knows that much of its carbon footprint comes from its supply chain. So, in 2017, it started Project Gigaton. This program seeks to engage suppliers in the collective goal of reducing or avoiding 1 billion metric tons (a gigaton) of GHG emissions by 2030. The initiative focuses on several key areas:\n\nEnergy Efficiency : Encouraging suppliers to adopt energy-efficient practices and technologies to minimize emissions.\n\nSustainable Agriculture : Promoting farming practices that reduce environmental impact and enhance carbon sequestration.\n\nWaste Reduction: Use strategies to cut waste during the product lifecycle. This starts from manufacturing and goes to end-of-life disposal.\n\nIn February 2024, Walmart said it met its Project Gigaton goal 6 years early. It cut, avoided, or captured one billion metric tons of CO\u2082e emissions from its supply chain. This milestone underscores the effectiveness of collaborative efforts in driving substantial environmental impact.\n\nAs of the latest reports, over 3,100 suppliers have now joined the project. They are helping to reduce emissions significantly.\n\nBy 2023, Walmart reduced operational emissions by 19.3% from its 2015 baseline, with a 45% decline in carbon intensity. However, a 3.9% rise in annual emissions that year has led the company to delay its predetermined reduction targets.\n\nOther major sustainability efforts of Walmart include:\n\nCircular Economy\n\nWalmart wants to promote a circular economy. They aim to cut waste and boost the reuse and recycling of materials. The company has set a goal to achieve zero waste in its operations in key markets, including the U.S., by 2025. Initiatives include:\n\noptimizing packaging,\n\nincreasing the recyclability of private-brand products, and\n\ncollaborating with suppliers to minimize waste throughout the product lifecycle.\n\nSustainable Product Sourcing\n\nEnsuring that products are sourced responsibly is integral to Walmart\u2019s sustainability efforts. The company aims to source key commodities by 2025. These include palm oil, beef, soy, pulp, paper, and timber. All must be free from deforestation. This means working together with suppliers.\n\nThe retailer established clear sourcing standards. They also support sustainable farming and forestry efforts.\n\nCollaborative Efforts and Advocacy\n\nWalmart understands that addressing climate change requires collective action. The company works with different coalitions and partners to promote sustainability in retail and beyond.\n\nWalmart wants to make a bigger impact. It does this by sharing best practices, supporting policies, and engaging stakeholders.\n\nChallenges and Future Outlook: Balancing Profit Margins with Green Initiatives\n\nWalmart has faced challenges in reaching its interim climate and net zero goals, despite its ambitious plans. In December 2024, the company said it won\u2019t meet its goals.\n\nIt expects to fall short of cutting operational GHG emissions by 35% by 2025 and 65% by 2030.\n\nSeveral factors cause this shortfall. First, some low-carbon technologies are not available. Others are too expensive, especially in refrigeration and transportation. Second, there are limits to their clean energy infrastructure and policies.\n\nWalmart tackles these challenges by investing in new ideas. They also work with industry partners, policymakers, and tech developers. The company works hard to speed up the development and use of sustainable technologies. It also wants to improve energy efficiency and support policies that help move us toward a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn summary, while Walmart has made significant strides in its financial performance, the path to achieving its long-term net zero goals requires more effort, innovation, and collaboration. The company takes a proactive stance and values transparency, making it a leader in corporate sustainability. It works hard to grow its business while also being responsible for its environmental footprint.",

However, the retailer\u2019s advertising business growth shows no signs of slowing and is helping buoy revenue as other parts of the business deal with tighter margins.\n\n\u201cIf you just take advertising and membership, just those two categories, that was a little more than a quarter of the overall operating income for us in the quarter,\u201d Rainey said on the call.\n\nWalmart\u2019s global ad business grew to $4.4 billion in 2024, with a 27% growth rate in line with the previous year\u2019s figure (28% to $3.4 billion). While the growth rate is encouraging, the retailer\u2019s ad business still has a ways to go to match its competitors: Amazon\u2019s ad revenue surpassed $56 billion last year, the first year in which ads ran on Prime Video.\n\nTo that point, Walmart is working to integrate Vizio into its operations after completing the acquisition for the TV maker in December, a move that anticipated a greater convergence of retail media and connected TV. The retailer expects the addition of Vizio and its SmartCast Operating System to its portfolio of advertising capabilities to help boost product discovery and provide brands with greater impact for their ad spend with the company.\n\n\u201cI'm just really pleased with the way it works for the Walmart Connect business to have more ways to distribute advertising for sellers and suppliers, that's really exciting for them. And we hope to be able to do that in a very efficient way,\u201d said President and CEO of Walmart U.S. John Furner on the earnings call.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Sharpening the picture on connected TV marketing, from the editorial team at Marketing Dive.

LISTEN NOW Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK -- A sharp slide for Walmart on Thursday helped pull Wall Street off its record.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.4% for its first drop after setting all-time highs in each of the last two days.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 450 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.5%.\n\nWalmart drove the market lower after falling 6.5%, even though the retailer reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nWalmart gave a forecast for upcoming profit that fell short of analysts' expectations as shoppers across the country deal with still-high inflation and the threat of tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nWalmart is still forecasting growth in revenue for this upcoming year and said it has experience in navigating the effects of tariffs, but its profit outlook helped pull stocks lower across the retail industry.\n\nCostco shares fell 2.6%, Target dropped 2% and Amazon lost 1.7%.\n\nPalantir Technologies was another weight on the market. The shares fell 5.2% to follow its 10.1% drop from the day before, after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he wants to cut $50 billion in spending next year.\n\nThe software company got 55% of its $2.9 billion in revenue last year from government customers.\n\nThey helped offset an 8.5% jump for shares of Baxter International, which reported better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nIt credited strength for its pharmaceuticals business, as well as for its medical products and therapies.\n\nShares of Burger chain Shake Shack rallied 11.1% after likewise reporting a stronger profit than expected.\n\nChief Executive Officer Rob Lynch said sales trends remained solid during the quarter, even though bad weather around the country and wildfires in the Los Angeles area kept some customers away.\n\nChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba saw its stock that trades in the United States climb 8.1% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nIt also talked up its artificial intelligence developments.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 26.63 points to 6,117.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 450.94 to 44,176.65, and the Nasdaq composite sank 93.89 to 19,962.36.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower after a report showed more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected.\n\nIt's an indication the pace of layoffs could be worsening, but the number still remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nA separate report said growth for manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is still growing, but not as strongly as economists expected.\n\nSuch numbers are likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold when it comes to lowering interest rates.\n\nLast month, the Fed refrained from cutting its main interest rate for the first time at a policy meeting since it began doing so in September.\n\nWhile lower rates can energize the economy and prices for investments, they can also give inflation more fuel.\n\nAnd Fed officials were discussing at their last meeting how Trump's plans for tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell from 4.54% late Wednesday to 4.50%.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for upcoming Fed moves, held steadier.\n\nIt remained at 4.27%, where it was late Wednesday.\n\nCurrency traders work near a screen showing the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), top left, and the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollar and South Korean won, top center, at the foreign exchange dealing room of the KEB Hana Bank headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025.

Brands are increasingly interested in selling and advertising on the retailer\u2019s online marketplace \u2014 often, in addition to Amazon.\n\nIn the retailer\u2019s latest financial figures, posted Thursday, the company gave a new piece of information about its e-commerce business it hasn\u2019t provided in a previous quarter: During the fourth quarter, the number of its marketplace sellers who also advertised with its retail media network grew by 50% over the past year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making good progress on expanding the number of U.S. marketplace sellers that also utilize Walmart Connect advertising,\u201d Walmart CFO John David Rainey said during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call. The company\u2019s overall U.S. advertising sales increased 24% year over year, and U.S. marketplace revenue grew 37%.\n\nThe new figure is reflective of a growing number of third-party Walmart sellers \u2014 150,000 as of last year, according to Marketplace Pulse. Like on Amazon, they have found a need to invest in ad placements on Walmart\u2019s website to promote their marketplace products. On a larger scale, this demonstrates how the retailer\u2019s different rapid digital investments work together to fuel overall growth.\n\nThe company posted a 20% year-over-year increase in its U.S. e-commerce sales for the fourth quarter. That far outpaced the retailer\u2019s overall U.S. comp sales growth of 4.6%. Advertising and memberships made up a little more than a quarter of the company\u2019s overall operating income in the fourth quarter, Rainey said. For the full year, Walmart\u2019s global advertising business grew 27% to $4.4 billion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an increased interest [in Walmart], for sure, across all categories,\u201d said Will Haire, co-founder and CEO of BellaVix, a marketing agency for sellers on Amazon and Walmart\u2019s marketplaces.\n\nHaire said he has talked to some brands who previously didn\u2019t think their customers would be shopping at Walmart who have now realized a need to have at least somewhat of a presence there. Those include brands that sell high-end baby or beauty products. This comes as Walmart executives have shared over the past few years that the big-box giant has gained market share with higher-income shoppers, particularly those making more than $100,000.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it actually shakes out,\u201d Haire said. \u201cThe Walmart shopper still appears to be more conservative and more working-class, whereas the Amazon shopper tends to have more discretionary income so they\u2019re more likely to pay extra and expect to see more premium brands.\u201d\n\nMore third-party sellers on Walmart\u2019s website increases the need for each individual seller to pay for visibility and exposure, said retail media analyst Andrew Lipsman of Media, Ads + Commerce. \u201cAs more brands have to compete for any individual search term, that also pushes monetization up over time,\u201d Lipsman said. \u201cThat\u2019s a way of winning mind share if your brand, especially, is not a household name.\u201d\n\nWalmart has been expanding in the advertising space since rebranding its retail media network to Walmart Connect in 2021. Amazon built its business on the idea of a flywheel: It has multiple components that bring customers and brands in, and as it grows, it reinvests to grow the business and bring costs down. Walmart, by contrast, has traditionally grown by selling products in its stores, though it has been growing its e-commerce business and more heavily investing in services. In December, Walmart completed its roughly $2.3 billion purchase of TV maker Vizio, providing another large channel through which to deliver ads to customers.\n\n\u201cI think all brands will need to have some type of presence on both [marketplaces],\u201d Haire said, adding, \u201cI do think the pendulum is starting to swing, and maybe people are just getting fed up with Amazon,\u201d pointing to increases in fees that have driven some sellers to look elsewhere.",

The results were largely as analysts forecast but underscore the broader battle for consumer spending between the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average component stocks.\n\nWalmart said early Thursday that its revenue grew 4.1% to $180.6 billion for its January-ended fourth quarter. Amazon, meanwhile, reported sales of $187.8 billion for its December-ended fourth quarter earlier this month.\n\nWalmart has topped lists of largest companies by revenue, such as the Fortune 500, every year since 2014. It will extend that crown for 2024, with Walmart's total sales of $680.99 billion staving off Amazon's $637.96 billion.\n\nStill, this is the first time Amazon has beat Walmart's sales on a quarterly basis. Amazon's Q4 includes more of the early holiday shopping calendar, however, than Walmart's November through January period.\n\nBut the race is on for the rest of the year. Walmart's fast-growing e-commerce business is attempting to win share in a U.S. market still dominated by Amazon. Of course, the businesses have key differences. Amazon has a massive cloud computing arm while Walmart has the world's largest footprint of physical stores.\n\nAnalysts project Amazon will post full-year sales of $700.8 billion, according to FactSet. Walmart is projected for $708.7 billion in sales for its current January-ending fiscal year. Analyst estimates will likely be updated following Thursday's report.\n\nAmazon Stock Slumps\n\nRather than celebrating, Amazon investors appear to be more concerned about Walmart's soft guidance and what it means for consumer spending.

            "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits as its competitive prices became a strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers. Yet uncertainty about the state of the American consumer and the potential impact of tariffs have seeped into expectations for 2025.\n\nThe financial outlook from nation\u2019s largest retailer, which has thrived amid stubborn inflation, delivered a jolt across the retail sector. Walmart sees per share profit over the next year coming in as much as 27 cents below analyst projections, a notable shift that sent company shares down more than 6% in midday trading.\n\nIts sales outlook was also mild, potentially a reflection of challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart\u2019s success.\n\nDuring an interview with The Associated Press Thursday, Walmart\u2019s Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said shoppers remain resilient while cautious, but there is no apparent change in behavior related to tariffs.\n\nThere is more uncertainty about what lies ahead and Rainey said Walmart\u2019s measured guidance reflects that.\n\n\u201cWe are one month into the year, and there\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t know,\u201d Rainey said, citing the new tariff increases.\n\nWalmart did not incorporate tariffs into its financial outlook, but Rainey acknowledged that the company\u2019s isn\u2019t immune to their impact.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work really hard to keep prices low for our members and customers,\u201d Rainey said. \u201cWe will do the things that we can.\u201d\n\nThat means being nimble with sourcing. Walmart, for example, is exploring new sourcing for microwave ovens given increased tariffs on aluminum and steel. But Rainey said some goods may have price increases.\n\nTariffs in the headlines have fueled concern and some more shopper retrenchment in Walmart\u2019s Mexico business, Rainey said.\n\nWalmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Two-thirds of Walmart\u2019s merchandise is sourced in the U.S., with groceries driving much of that. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business.\n\nStill, Walmart shares took a hit, and other big retailers fell, too.\n\nWalmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report financial results and the numbers can provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper. Over the past year Americans have focused increasingly on necessities rather than big TVs, furniture or appliances. They\u2019ve become much more discerning because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.\n\nWalmart has flourished in that environment. It\u2019s gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart\u2019s online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers\n\n\u201cWe have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\u201d said CEO Doug McMillon. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we\u2019re in great shape with inventory.\u201d\n\nStill, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump\u2019s first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart\u2019s sales.\n\nGovernment data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year.\n\nWalmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents. Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.\n\nAnalysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nFor Walmart\u2019s U.S. division, comparable store sales \u2014 which include online and stores open for the past 12 months \u2014 rose 4.6% in the U.S., a bit lower than the 5.3% in the previous quarter. The retailer had a 4.2% jump in the U.S. in the second quarter and 3.8% in the first quarter.\n\nGlobal e-commerce sales rose 16% in the latest quarter, notably slower than the 27% increase in the third quarter.\n\nWalmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart projects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That\u2019s also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.\n\nIt forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That is also a bit light, with analysts expecting sales of $167.05 billion.\n\nWalmart expects annual sales to rise between 3% and 4%, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that Wall Street projected.",

CEO Eddie Wu attributed that shiny result to growth in the company's cloud business and its triple-digit expansion in artificial intelligence during the past six quarters, though increasing retail sales also played a part.\n\nAmazon, like Alibaba, wears dual hats of retailer and cloud provider. The company's retail unit is its biggest moneymaker \u2014 but revenue is also fueled by its cloud computing services.

The S&P 500 was down 0.43%, retreating from recent highs and putting it in the red for the week thus far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.01% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.47%. Asia-Pacific stocks climbed Friday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index popped more than 3.4% to its highest level since February 2022, on the back of Alibaba shares surging.

SIGN UP SIGN UP\n\nSustained inflation in Japan\n\nJapan's inflation rate in January climbed to 4% year on year, hitting its highest level since January 2023. Core inflation \u2014 which excludes prices of fresh food \u2014 rose to 3.2%, beating economists' expectations of 3.1%, according to a Reuters poll. This figure was the highest since June 2023. The headline inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 34 straight months.\n\nAlibaba shares pop on cloud growth\n\nAlibaba shot up 8.1% in U.S. on Thursday and jumped as much as 12% in Hong Kong on Friday. The Chinese tech giant on Thursday reported net income of 48.945 billion yuan ($6.72 billion) in the December quarter, a 239% surge from a year ago. Alibaba's top line was also better than expected, lifted by 13% year-on-year sales growth in its Cloud Intelligence Group during the quarter. Separately, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen increased his personal stake in Alibaba to around $1 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\n\nAmazon's quarterly revenue beats Walmart's\n\nAmazon has dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever. Amazon said earlier this month that it brought in $187.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter \u2014 above the $180.5 billion reported by Walmart on Thursday. Since 2012, Walmart has held the distinction of being the top revenue generator each quarter, a title it gained after overtaking oil giant Exxon Mobil.\n\nTaking Thames private\n\nPrivate equity investor KKR is offering about \u00a34 billion ($5 billion) for U.K.'s struggling Thames Water utility, according to a person familiar with the matter. The water utility firm is saddled with ballooning debt and has warned it will run out of cash by March 24. KKR's involvement would comprise a \u00a34 billion management-buyout submission that would not result in the sale of assets or a breakup of the utility, the source said.\n\n[PRO] Behind Thursday's sell-off\n\nWalmart, as the U.S.' largest retailer and generator of revenue, serves as a bellwether for consumer health.

But the arrival of a friendlier administration under U.S. President Donald Trump, which kickstarted fledgling talks to end the conflict in Ukraine \u2014 as well as a way in from the economic and geopolitical cold \u2014 are prompting a softening of the Kremlin's adversarial stance.\n\nAs tensions between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spilled into open acrimony on Wednesday, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" Putin praised Trump for showing restraint amid what he described as \"hysteria\" by European leaders who are angry at being left out of negotiations on Ukraine's future.",

But its outlook disappointed Wall Street.\n\nIn the fiscal year ahead, the discounter said it expects net sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted operating income to increase between 3.5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis. The company said that includes a 150 basis point, or 1.5 percentage point, headwind from acquiring smart TV company Vizio and following a leap year in 2024. For the just completed fiscal year, Walmart posted adjusted operating income growth of 9.7% on a constant currency basis.\n\nThe company also said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, which includes a 5 cent per share headwind from currency. That fell short of the $2.76 per share Wall Street had expected.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey described consumer spending patterns as \"steady\" and said \"there's not any sharp changes that we've seen.\"\n\nYet he acknowledged \"there's far from certainty in the geopolitical landscape.\"\n\nAbout two-thirds of what Walmart sells is made, grown or assembled in the U.S. Yet if tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada take effect, he said Walmart is \"not going to be completely immune.\"\n\n\"We've lived in a tariff environment for the last seven or eight years, and we'll do what we know how to do,\" he said. \"We'll work with suppliers. We'll lean into our private brand. We'll shift supply where necessary to try to take advantage of lower costs that we can then pass on to consumers.\"\n\nSince Walmart is not sure if the tariffs will take effect next month, the company did not factor them into its guidance, Rainey said.\n\nHere is what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal fourth quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 66 cents adjusted vs 64 cents expected\n\n66 cents adjusted vs 64 cents expected Revenue: $180.55 billion vs. $180.01 billion expected\n\nIn the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart's net income fell to $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, compared with $5.49 billion or 68 cents per share in the year-ago period. Revenue rose from $173.39 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The expected move per the options market calls for +/- 4.89 points, or 4.7% of the current stock price.\n\nWalmart is trading just short of all-time highs. The lofty expectations present a problem, given they leave more room for disappointment. However, a pullback in the price could see potential support at the swing high base set through December around the 96 level. Alternatively, prices at all-time highs leaves little possible resistance if results impress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. #@fxwestwater\n\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\n\nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive Inc. and tastytrade Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.",

            "content": "Walmart is known for its low prices and no frills approach.\n\nSo it may come as a surprise that wealthier shoppers are helping to fuel the retailer\u2019s growth.\n\nFor more than two years, the discounter has noticed more customers with six-figure incomes shopping on its website and in its stores. Households earning more than $100,000 made up 75% of the company\u2019s market share gains in the fiscal third quarter, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company\u2019s earnings call in November.\n\nThose newer and more frequent customers have helped support the company\u2019s aspirations to sell more higher-margin items, such as clothing and home goods. They are driving Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales, which have grown by double digits for 10 consecutive quarters. And they can boost the retailer\u2019s newer revenue streams, such as subscription-based membership program Walmart+ and its advertising business Walmart Connect.\n\nAs Walmart reports its latest earnings on Thursday, Wall Street will be watching whether those upper-income customers are sticking around, after market share gains helped the retailer\u2019s shares soar about 83% in the last year. Yet some investors have questioned whether Walmart\u2019s traction with affluent shoppers has staying power, especially if the sticker shock of inflation cools.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner acknowledged that the retailer has gained and then lost upper-income customers before, such as in 2008 and 2009 during the Great Recession. Affluent shoppers stretched their dollars at the big-box retailer, but then ultimately returned to competitors.\n\nThis time, Furner said the gains will last because Walmart can save shoppers both time and money with e-commerce options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different because we deliver to you at the curb [of the store],\u201d he said in the late January interview. \u201cWe deliver to your house. We deliver your refrigerator. That whole Supercenter, which is an amazing retail format, is available in an hour or two for a large part of the country and growing really quickly.\n\nDelivering growth\n\nWalmart\u2019s expanding digital services have helped convince higher-income shoppers to give it a shot, said Brad Thomas, a retail analyst and managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Some of those newer or more frequent customers have joined Walmart+, a subscription-based membership program that includes perks like free home deliveries. Walmart+, which launched about five years ago, is Walmart\u2019s answer to Amazon Prime.\n\nWalmart has not disclosed the program\u2019s membership count, but it has reported double-digit membership income growth in each of the past four quarters..\n\nThomas said e-commerce options wipe out a potential hurdle for affluent shoppers: a potential stigma about shopping at the big-box stores themselves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a customer in America that doesn\u2019t think of itself as a Walmart shopper,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think of themselves as a Target shopper or a Publix or a Whole Foods shopper and through the app and through the delivery capabilities, they can remain a non-Walmart core shopper, but get all the benefits of getting the branded items at Walmart prices.\u201d\n\nAs inflation forced shoppers of all incomes to hunt for deals, some wealthier consumers realized they can get the same national brands like Tide detergent or Bounty paper towels from Walmart cheaper and often faster than at Amazon because of Walmart\u2019s nearby stores, he said.\n\nWalmart\u2019s website and app have increased their selection, too, as the company has bulked up its third-party marketplace. Starting this summer, the company began offering premium beauty brands through its website, including hairdryers from T3 and perfumes from Victoria\u2019s Secret.\n\nShoppers can now find handbags from Chanel and Louis Vuitton, too. Last month, Walmart announced a deal with resale platform Rebag, which sells the items through Walmart\u2019s marketplace.\n\nYet as Walmart tries to keep those customers, it wants to encourage them to shop in person, as well. Walmart has stepped up investments in its stores to freshen its look and counter negative perceptions that higher-income shoppers might have.\n\nWalmart has sped up the pace of remodels for its more than 4,600 stores across the U.S., with plans to revamp about 650 locations per year, an acceleration from a prior cadence of 450 to 500 per year, said Hunter Hart, senior vice president of Walmart Realty.\n\nRemodeled stores have brighter lighting, wider aisles and mannequins, said Alvis Washington, Walmart\u2019s vice president of retail brand experience. The stores also feature Walmart\u2019s newer and more fashion-forward brands like Scoop and Free Assembly, and national brands that shoppers would recognize, such as Reebok.\n\nThe discounter launched a new grocery brand, BetterGoods, last year with colorful packaging and creative flavors that looks similar to merchandise that shoppers might find at Trader Joe\u2019s or Target.\n\nThe Walmart U.S. CEO Furner said some of those changes have drawn upper-income customers to the company\u2019s stores and app.\n\nHe said Walmart\u2019s market share gains with affluent shoppers have come from online and in-store shopping, but added curbside pickup orders showed early signs of popularity with those customers. Even before the pandemic, Walmart saw that people who shopped with curbside pickup bought more higher-priced items, such as prime beef and seafood, Furner added.\n\nHe said that still rings true: Walmart sees more premium items in the shopping baskets of customers who buy online, get home deliveries or use curbside pickup.\n\nWashington said Walmart treaded carefully with its store redesign, realizing it could risk its reputation for low prices and resonance with core customers, who typically have lower incomes. It promoted newer brands, but mixed in familiar staples, such as folded piles of inexpensive bath towels and denim.\n\n\u201cHaving a great, elevated experience and great value aren\u2019t mutually exclusive,\u201d Walmart\u2019s Washington said, recounting the company\u2019s approach. \u201cSo when we looked at this, it\u2019s like, how do we do both and make sure we can gain new customers and maintain the customers that we have?\n\nWhen comparing remodeled stores to the rest of the fleet, Washington said higher comparable store sales reflect that customers like the different look. Walmart declined to provide specific numbers, saying it won\u2019t release sales numbers until it reports fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nWalmart\u2019s customer mix for its U.S. e-commerce business hasn\u2019t changed, even as it attracts higher-income shoppers, according to an analysis by market research firm Euromonitor. About 34% of Walmart\u2019s online customers in the U.S. last year had incomes of $100,000 and above, which is roughly flat compared to two years prior.\n\nMichelle Evans, global lead for retail and digital shopper insights at Euromonitor, said that indicates that Walmart is also gaining market share from lower- and middle-income customers.\n\nWalmart still has a smaller share of higher-income shoppers than some key rivals: 49% and 48% of online U.S. shoppers at Target and Amazon, respectively, have incomes above $100,000.\n\nAmazon remains a formidable competitor, especially when it comes to wealthier shoppers and general merchandise categories, Evans said. But Walmart\u2019s biggest edge is its grocery department.\n\nGrocery gains\n\nOne of Walmart\u2019s newer, higher-income shoppers is Francesca Frink. The 30-year-old lives in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Ill. with her husband, Sam, 1-year-old son and their English setter. The Frink family\u2019s combined annual household income is over $200,000.\n\nLast fall, Francesca Frink signed up for Walmart+ after her mother-in-law ordered a stroller from Walmart\u2019s website and got it dropped at her door three hours later.\n\nInitially, she said she hesitated to order fresh foods from Walmart. She bought packaged items like pasta and flour. Yet over time, the couple began ordering a larger portion of groceries, dog treats and even clothes for their son from Walmart.\n\nThe Frinks have stopped going to their old grocery store, Kroger-owned supermarket Mariano\u2019s. They estimate that their weekly grocery bill is about 20% cheaper.\n\nPreviously, the couple said they avoided Walmart because their nearest store is outdated. Yet Sam Frink said the game has changed with curbside pickup and home deliveries.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201d\n\nFrancesca Frink said home deliveries from Walmart, included in their Walmart+ membership, save the couple time while they juggle two careers, a toddler and a dog. Plus, she said she found that Walmart had the grocery items she wanted and even those she didn\u2019t expect, including organic blueberries, natural peanut butter and specialty mushroom ravioli.\n\nStill, Francesca Frink said she still faces some apprehension from friends and family about buying groceries from Walmart.\n\nBut she said they\u2019ve been surprised when they\u2019ve tried and liked food items from Walmart.\n\nIn her day job, Euromonitor\u2019s Evans tracked Walmart\u2019s digital gains with higher-income shoppers. Yet she also saw it firsthand in her household.\n\nHer husband signed the family up for Walmart+. During the holiday season, he told her all of his Christmas purchases would be coming from the discounter.\n\n\u201cHe made a comment that all the gifts were coming from Walmart, and obviously that comes with a certain impression,\u201d she said.\n\nSo she was surprised when she opened his gift and discovered it was a Michael Kors tote.",

Meanwhile, Walmart seems to attract more repeat monthly visitors (who visit the chain at least twice a month), perhaps thanks to the chain\u2019s extensive grocery offerings and to its popularity among rural and semirural segments who may not have a variety of retail options to frequent.\u201d\n\nAccording to the research, the two chains\u2019 visitor bases also exhibit differences in in-store behavior. Walmart visitors seem to \u201clinger a little longer in store, with 20.7% of the chain\u2019s visits lasting longer than 45 minutes compared to Target\u2019s 17.1%\u2014maybe thanks to the mission-driven shopping behavior of some of its rural and semirural customer base. But despite the longer visits, Walmart still receives a larger share of weekday visits than Target\u2014perhaps thanks to its larger share of single shoppers with fewer weekday commitments.\u201d\n\nIn January 2025, NACS Daily reported that big retailers\u2019 grasp on consumers is only getting stronger. The three biggest retailers by revenue in the U.S. are Costco, Walmart and Amazon, and they\u2019re gaining customers from small businesses. Amazon and Walmart\u2019s fast-growing online sales\u2014including those from third-party sellers\u2014help them generate high-margin profit streams such as advertising and third-party fulfillment services. This in turn gives these retailers room to cut pricing to attract more customers.",

            "content": "Walmart topped earnings and revenue estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter, but said its profit growth will slow in the current fiscal year.\n\nStill, the retailer's CFO, John David Rainey, said the company wouldn't be \"immune\" from looming tariffs on Mexico and Canada.\n\nWalmart saw strong gains in its e-commerce business and membership programs.\n\nWalmart shares fell more than 6% Thursday, as the big-box retailer said profit growth will slow this fiscal year even as sales continue to climb.\n\nWalmart said holiday-quarter revenue rose about 4% and e-commerce sales shot up 20% in the U.S., as growth in store pickup and home deliveries and gains with upper-income shoppers boosted results. But its outlook disappointed Wall Street.\n\nWe've got the news you need to know to start your day. Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter \u2014 delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.\n\nIn the fiscal year ahead, the discounter said it expects net sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted operating income to increase between 3.5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis. The company said that includes a 150 basis point, or 1.5 percentage point, headwind from acquiring smart TV company Vizio and following a leap year in 2024. For the just completed fiscal year, Walmart posted adjusted operating income growth of 9.7% on a constant currency basis.\n\nThe company also said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, which includes a 5 cent per share headwind from currency. That fell short of the $2.76 per share Wall Street had expected.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey described consumer spending patterns as \"steady\" and said \"there's not any sharp changes that we've seen.\"\n\nYet he acknowledged \"there's far from certainty in the geopolitical landscape.\"\n\nAbout two-thirds of what Walmart sells is made, grown or assembled in the U.S. Yet if tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada take effect, he said Walmart is \"not going to be completely immune.\"\n\n\"We've lived in a tariff environment for the last seven or eight years, and we'll do what we know how to do,\" he said. \"We'll work with suppliers. We'll lean into our private brand. We'll shift supply where necessary to try to take advantage of lower costs that we can then pass on to consumers.\"\n\nSince Walmart is not sure if the tariffs will take effect next month, the company did not factor them into its guidance, Rainey said.\n\nHere is what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal fourth quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 66 cents adjusted vs 64 cents expected\n\n66 cents adjusted vs 64 cents expected Revenue: $180.55 billion vs. $180.01 billion expected\n\nIn the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart's net income fell to $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, compared with $5.49 billion or 68 cents per share in the year-ago period. Revenue rose from $173.39 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company's adjusted earnings per share figure excluded one-time items, including opioid-related legal costs and gains and losses on equity and other investments.\n\nComparable sales, an industry metric also known as same-store sales, increased 4.6% for Walmart's U.S. business and 6.8% for Sam's Club, excluding fuel.\n\nWalmart's e-commerce sales in the U.S. soared 20% compared with the year-ago period. That marked the 11th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales rose 16%.\n\nIn the Walmart U.S. segment, customers' store visits and purchases climbed, as transactions rose 2.8% and average ticket increased 1.8% year over year.\n\nKeeping tabs on the U.S. consumer\n\nSince Walmart is the nation's top grocer, investors often view it as a barometer of consumer health. Investors have tried to parse whether softer U.S. retail sales in January were a blip or warning sign. Wall Street also is trying to understand the potential impact of policy decisions, such as tariffs, on consumer spending.\n\nRestaurant chains, including Restaurant Brands' Burger King and Popeyes, said sales improved in the fourth quarter, but they had weak trends in January.\n\nYet those restaurants and some retail experts have blamed short-term factors for the drop, including winter storms, consumers taking a break after splurging over the holidays and contending with damage and disruption from the Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nRainey echoed those sentiments on the call with CNBC, saying cold weather and the wildfires hurt Walmart's sales. He said that's temporary, however, and doesn't indicate a change in consumer spending patterns.\n\nEven so, the big-box retailer faced many questions from retail analysts on Thursday's earnings call about the reasons for its conservative forecast.\n\nOn the earnings call, Rainey said the outlook is consistent with Walmart's guidance for the last two years, when it projected operating income growth of 4% to 6% annually. If the company took out the impact from the Vizio acquisition and extra day from leap year, he said the outlook would be 5% to 7%, which would represent an acceleration from its previous guidance ranges.\n\nStill, he said, \"it's prudent to have an outlook that is somewhat measured.\"\n\n\"We have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time and we don't want to get out over our skis here,\" he said. \"There's a lot of the year to play out. Again, we feel good about our ability to navigate the environment, whether it's tariffs or other macro [economic] uncertainty.\"\n\nWalmart's new moneymakers\n\nWalmart has taken a page from rival Amazon's book, as it chases ways make money outside of retail. Those newer moneymakers worked in its favor in the fourth quarter. Its advertising business and third-party marketplace are small compared with Amazon's, but have posted gains and driven higher margins than Walmart's retail business.\n\nGlobal membership income grew by 16% year over year, with some of that coming from its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+, in addition to warehouse club Sam's Club. Its global advertising business grew 29%, including a 24% increase in Walmart Connect.\n\nWalmart's third-party marketplace and its fulfillment services segment, which packs and ships orders for marketplace sellers, also rose by double digits.\n\n\"These are all higher margin, faster-growing parts of our business where the math is just suggesting that our margins are going up over time,\" he said on the call with CNBC. \"And frankly, I don't see any end to this.\"\n\nFaster and more frequent deliveries have helped Walmart's e-commerce business become more profitable. On the earnings call, Rainey said the delivery routes for Walmart have become denser as customers place more orders. Plus, he said, shoppers have shown a willingness to pay more to speed online orders to their doors.\n\nOver 30% of Walmart customers who have an item delivered from a store have paid an extra fee to have that delivered within a few hours, Rainey said. On Christmas Eve, he said, 77% of orders were express deliveries. Those faster deliveries, which are made in less than two hours, cost an additional $10.\n\nOne of Walmart's newer services, pharmacy deliveries, is a growth opportunity, too, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said on the earnings call. The deliveries began in October in six states, but have expanded across the country.\n\nAs customers order a prescription for a sick family member or place an order for their regular medication, many are buying other items like groceries, Furner said.\n\nWalmart also hiked its dividend by 13% to 94 cents per share, the largest increase in more than a decade.\n\nAs of Wednesday's close, shares of Walmart are up about 83% over the past year. The stock closed on Wednesday at $104.00, up about 15% so far this year and outpacing the approximately 4% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period.",

            "content": "Retailers like Kroger and Walmart are monitoring both how GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro could create opportunities to grow their pharmacy businesses as well as reduce sales of snacks and sweets in the grocery aisle. Still, it remains to be seen how much of the market for these medications big-name retailers could penetrate or how existential of a threat they could pose to the food business.\n\nRetailers, then, face a double-edged sword when trying to figure out how GLP-1 drugs could impact their businesses. Albertsons and Walmart have both recently acknowledged that the sale of GLP-1 medications \u2014 used both for weight loss and managing chronic conditions including diabetes \u2014 have at least slightly helped sales for their pharmacy businesses.\n\nAt Albertsons, pharmacy sales have increased in share to 11% of its total annual revenue, CEO Vivek Sankaran said in January, attributing this to growth in prescriptions like GLP-1 medications as well as success in immunization and customer service. Walmart saw percentage sales growth in the mid-teens for its health and wellness category, CFO John David Rainey said in the company\u2019s last earnings call in November, citing branded pharmacy prescriptions including GLP-1 drugs.\n\nBut, households with at least one person using GLP-1 medication cut their grocery spending by about 6% within six months of taking the drug, according to a Cornell University and Numerator study published in December. The researchers found significantly larger decreases in purchases of calorie-dense, processed items like chips and increases in nutrient-dense items like yogurt and fresh produce.\n\nKroger chief accounting officer Todd Foley said in a call with investors in December that he expects more growth in the GLP-1 space at least in the near future. \u201cAs we sit here today, I think we continue to expect to see growth in that area as more manufacturers get in the mix and the supply continues to become more available, and more patients continue to utilize that drug.\u201d\n\nAbout 1 in 8 U.S. adults have used GLP-1 medications, according to survey results reported last May by nonprofit health policy research organization KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nOne important thing to note is GLP-1 drug users still don\u2019t represent enough of the population to make a significant impact for CPGs, food manufacturers and retailers, Numerator chief economist Leo Feler, who worked on the joint study with Cornell, told Modern Retail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively small impact, multiplied by a relatively small fraction of the population that are on these medications, so it doesn\u2019t lead to a very noticeable difference in aggregate for retailers and for food manufacturers,\u201d Feler said, adding that this could change over the next five or 10 years if GLP-1 use grows. \u201cPlanning for it now is what allows companies to make sure that they\u2019re offering the right kind of products for consumers and that they\u2019ve adapted to what consumers want.\u201d\n\nSome food manufacturers have already made attempts to reach customers using GLP-1 drugs. In December, Nestle launched a new pre-meal drink designed to promote the natural production of the GLP-1 hormone. Conagra Brands began marketing some of its high-protein or nutrient-packed items as \u201cGLP-1-friendly.\u201d\n\nBut it has been difficult for pharmacies and drug developers to meet the high demand for the medications and keep them stocked. And as the FDA still lists drugs like Ozempic as in shortage, that lifts restrictions to allow pharmacies to make compounded drugs \u2014 similar versions of the same medication \u2014 available often at cheaper prices through telehealth companies like Hims & Hers.\n\n\u201cDemand and shortages have created this cottage industry market of knockoff weight-loss drugs that are not being sold and dispensed by your typical players, and that\u2019s created a bit of a challenge for your traditional drug makers and traditional retail pharmacies,\u201d Rajiv Leventhal, a health care analyst for eMarketer, said in an interview. He said additionally, because of patent protection, negotiation power is still in the hands of drug makers like Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk, limiting the amount of reimbursement received by pharmacies.\n\n\u201cRetail pharmacies want to get their hands on these drugs to dispense them. They want patients and customers coming into their stores to fill their prescriptions so they can buy some front-of-the-store items on their way out. They aren\u2019t necessarily generating a lot of profit from stocking these drugs, which are expensive to stock, or from getting reimbursed for dispensing these medications,\u201d Leventhal said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cash cow to dispense Ozempic.\u201d",

Combatting DEI and irreversible and radical transgender drug regimens for children have been top priorities for the current Trump administration, which has issued a series of executive orders aimed at eliminating the practices in the federal government, at public institutions, and at private corporations.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery company should follow Walmart\u2019s lead and end divisive and legally risky DEI policies,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel and Senior Vice President for Corporate Engagement Jeremy Tedesco. \u201cPrivate companies like Walmart are now operating within a new legal environment where it\u2019s crystal clear that DEI\u2019s legal and reputational risks far outweigh any perceived benefits. DEI policies inherently treat some people worse than others based on their protected characteristics like sex and race. President Trump\u2019s executive orders rightly prioritize meritocracy over discriminatory DEI policies, and companies like Walmart are doing the right thing by revisiting their past decisions and taking corrective action to adapt to this new legal and cultural landscape.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of a growing list of U.S. companies to cut ties with DEI and the HRC\u2019s index over the past year, Walmart came under fire from activists just a week before President Trump\u2019s inauguration, when activist shareholders and 13 Democrat state attorneys general sent letters pressuring the nation\u2019s largest private employer to readopt DEI policies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe timing of these letters could not have been worse,\u201d the coalition wrote to McMillon. \u201cWithin a week of their arrival, President Trump issued a series of executive orders aimed at rooting out discriminatory DEI practices from the federal government and private companies\u2014including corporations like [Walmart]. Companies that double-down on DEI policies are now playing a dangerous game of chicken with the administration, and they\u2019re doing so at the expense of shareholders we represent.\u201d\n\n\n\nShareholders have filed over 60 ADF-backed resolutions for the upcoming season, including 10 that call on major companies including federal contractors Lockheed Martin, ConocoPhillips, and IBM to provide transparency to their shareholders on the impact of their DEI policies. Overall, ADF-backed resolutions have resulted in more than 30 meetings with corporate leaders, and have led to important policy changes and transparency at PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Morgan Stanley, and Verizon.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s success is built on the value of hard work and excellence, said SFOF CEO O.J. Oleka. \u201cDEI promises the exact opposite of that high standard. Companies like Walmart that reject this failed ideology are doing their part to prioritize equal opportunity for employees and long-term financial success for their shareholders. Public employees depend on state financial officers like treasurers and auditors to safeguard their hard-earned financial futures, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re encouraging Walmart to continue to rightly value merit over ideology.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom is an alliance-building, non-profit legal organization committed to protecting religious freedom, free speech, parental rights, and the sanctity of life.\n\n# # #",

Walmart\u2019s international segment is expected to post revenue of $32.44 billion, up fractionally.\n\nWalmart, which typically offers conservative guidance, seldom underperforms the Wall Street consensus. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has said the retailer is set to grow net income ahead of revenue thanks in part to higher-profit ancillary segments like advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services.\n\nThe benchmark metric of U.S. same-store sales is expected to rise 4% excluding fuel, which would be unchanged. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales are estimated at 4.5%, excluding fuel, up from 3.1% a year ago.\n\nThe National Retail Federation (NRF) reported that holiday sales grew 4% during November and December which correlates to two-thirds of Walmart\u2019s fourth quarter. January sales were up 5.44%, and up 5.72% excluding restaurants, autos and fuel, according to the trade group.\n\nAnalysts expect Walmart will be one of the winners from the holiday season in part because of strong online sales, health and beauty sales, home and fashion sales, and robust food sales.\n\nD.A.

Morgan Stanley expects quarterly earnings of 66 cents per share, slightly ahead of consensus.\n\nUBS equity analyst Michael Lassiter said 20% of all U.S. retail grocery sales go through Walmart. He praised Walmart\u2019s core business of selling a wide array of goods at value, and said the company\u2019s efforts to diversify the revenue stream with its ancillary business segments also give it the ability to keep prices low while investing in customer service improvements.\n\nWalmart\u2019s stock price has increased in value by more than 85% over the past year prompting J.P. Morgan to recently raise its annual target price to $112 with an overweight \u201cbuy\u201d rating ahead of the earnings report.\n\nTelsey Advisory Group also raised its price target on Feb. 12 to $115 reiterating its \u201cbuy\u201d rating.

The transportation of heavier, bulkier packages requires more fuel. Once discarded, excess packaging fills landfills, breaking down and releasing harmful substances into the air.\n\nIs Walmart doing anything about this?\n\nWalmart has made public commitments to reduce packaging waste across its operations. The company aims to make its private brand packaging 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable. It's joined other retailers in the Beyond the Bag consortium to find alternatives to single-use shopping bags.\n\nHowever, this Reddit post suggests there's still room for improvement in its packaging practices.\n\nWhat's being done about excess packaging more broadly?\n\nCompanies like Loop partner with major retailers to offer popular products in reusable containers. Some states require packaging producers to fund recycling programs through extended producer responsibility laws. Target recently announced plans to reduce excess packaging from its owned brands.\n\nAt home, people can help by choosing products with minimal packaging when shopping. Writing to companies about wasteful packaging practices can encourage positive change.\n\nSupporting stores and brands that minimize packaging waste sends a clear message that customers value Earth-friendly options.

Walmart vowed to remove certain third-party transgender products inappropriately marketed towards children from their online stores, and review grants given to Pride events to avoid sexualized programming targeted towards children.\n\nWalmart also ended its participation in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality index, which grades companies on its LGBTQ policies, and vowed to cease using the terms \"LatinX\" and \"DEI\" in official communications.\n\nCATERPILLAR MAKES POLICY CHANGES IN YET ANOTHER CORPORATE DEI ROLLBACK\n\n\"Like many companies all across the U.S., we've been on a journey,\" Furner said. \"We'll continue to be on a journey. And what we're trying to do is to ensure every customer, every associate feels welcomed here in the shop and to feel like they belong,\" Walmart US CEO and President John Furner told CBS Mornings in November.\n\nThe letter was drafted in response to a previous letter drafted by 30 Walmart shareholders blasting their DEI rollbacks.\n\n\"Seeing the company retreat from its stated values and the business opportunities associated with a diverse and inclusive workforce is very disheartening, additionally, Walmart has not offered a financial or business case for this change in policy, but the company identified advancing \u2018belonging, diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 as one of four priority ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value,\" the signatories wrote in January.\n\nJUDGE ORDERS WALMART SHOPLIFTERS TO WASH CARS IN STORE PARKING LOT\n\nWalmart, which is the country's largest private employer, was targeted by 13 Democratic state attorneys general, which also sent a letter the day after the left-wing shareholders pressed the retailer to reconsider its decision to eliminate many of its DEI initiatives.\n\n\"Threats to boycott, sue or otherwise negatively impact Walmart\u2019s bottom line may well have contributed to your decision to walk away from your commitments to DEI. But we are concerned that Walmart failed to consider the other side \u2014 the customers and employees that will be alienated by this departure,\" the state AG\u2019s wrote.\n\nBowyer Research fund president Jerry Bowyer says that Walmart was \"smart\" to move away from DEI and feels that Democratic-led states are attempting to intimidate the retailer into backsliding on DEI by throwing their weight and pension money around.\n\nBowyer, a signatory to the letter, said Walmart meant well in adopting DEI in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death, but failed to \"read the fine print\" on how these policies would require them to \"stop treating people equally.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nInspire Investing CEO Robert Netzly, told Fox News Digital that his firm, which represents faith-based investors from across the country, signed the letter because his clients have \"deep concerns\" about DEI and view the policies as \"immoral\" and \"divisive.\"\n\n\"Those policies not only hurt the people who work there by providing an unfair and discriminatory environment, but also introduce legal risks and shareholder risk from [a] financial standpoint,\" he said.\n\nWalmart didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

How long can it keep the spark going?\n\nAfter years of lagging behind the retail stars Costco Wholesale and Amazon.com, Walmart is catching up quickly. Its shares rose 72% in 2024, and are up another 16% so far this year. Walmart has become an e-commerce heavyweight, and it is gaining share with both low- and high-income shoppers.\n\nFor some time, America\u2019s largest retailer\u2014for better or worse\u2014was best known for its corporate motto: Every Day Low Prices. Target and Costco were the places where higher-earning consumers went for exciting products and a fun store experience, while Amazon was light years ahead on e-commerce. Over the past few years, though, Walmart has started encroaching on those competitors\u2019 territory. To begin with, more of the well-to-do are shopping at Walmart. In February, 89% of households surveyed by Morning Consult earning at least $100,000 said they shopped at the retailer, up from 77% five years earlier. The share of low- and middle-income consumers who shop at Walmart has also grown over the period, according to the survey. Its favorability rating among high-income consumers has improved. About 36% of high-income respondents surveyed by Morning Consult this year said they had a \u201cvery favorable\u201d impression of Walmart, up from 27% in 2019. Meanwhile, Walmart\u2019s e-commerce revenue\u2014including Sam\u2019s Club and its international segment\u2014hit $100 billion in the fiscal year ended in January 2024. Walmart\u2019s total e-commerce business is now about a fifth of the size of Amazon\u2019s, compared with about 10% in 2017. Its paid membership reach is getting harder to ignore. The data firm Numerator estimates that about 12% of U.S. consumers have a Walmart+ membership, compared with Amazon Prime\u2019s 62% share.

            "content": "In 2024, Walmart cleared $648 billion in revenue. That's an enormous but unsurprising number when you learn there are more than 4,600 Walmart locations across the United State. Thanks to its high number of stores, it's also America's largest grocery store chain \u2014 by a longshot. According to FoodIndustry.com, the closest grocery store behind it is Kroger's, which operates 2,750 stores \u2014 a paltry number by comparison. However, according to new research by online lender CashNetUSA, not all Walmarts are equal across the nation.\n\nIn February, the website shared new research showcasing which states have the cheapest and most expensive Walmart stores in the country. According to the report, it determined its rankings by compiling two lists of 12 food and drink items purchased by a \"typical grocery and vegan grocery list,\" including eggs, breakfast cereal, boneless chicken breast, milk, and bread. It recorded the prices of all the items in each state\u2019s biggest city via Walmart\u2019s website. Then, it compared the total cost for each state\u2019s list against the national average to \"calculate the price premium for groceries and vegan groceries by state.\" It calculated the affordability of the lists in every state compared to the local average wage, and finally compared price premiums in 2024 against those in its Walmart prices data from 2023.\n\nHere's what it found.\n\nTexas is home to the least expensive Walmarts\n\nAfter all that research, the team named Texas as the least expensive destination for Walmart groceries. The findings noted that the groceries in Texas cost 4.77% less than the national average. It's joined by Maryland in second, followed by Wisconsin, New Mexico, and New York as the least expensive states.\n\nCourtesy of CashNetUSA\n\nBut Massachusetts is the most affordable all around\n\nHowever, the team also broke out the \"most affordable\" list by comparing the average cost of the 12-item cart to the average wage in each state. By looking at that metric, the team found that Massachusetts has the most affordable groceries, taking an average of 59 minutes of work to afford the cart. It was followed by New York at one hour, Washington at one hour and one minute, Maryland at one hour and four minutes, and Connecticut and California tied for fifth at one hour and five minutes.\n\n\"In terms of affordability, our analysis found that California, New York, and New Jersey were among the most affordable states for both types of groceries in 2024, even though they have a higher cost of living,\" Matt Pelkey, the content strategy manager at CashNetUSA, shared with Food & Wine. \"This might suggest that higher wages offset grocery expenses, making food more affordable relative to income. On the other hand, Southern and rural states dominate the least affordable lists, highlighting how lower average wages can make grocery costs more challenging.\"\n\nSome states have higher prices due to grocery taxes\n\nAs Pelkey noted, \"Grocery taxes do contribute to higher prices in some states. Among the 11 states that paid the most for typical Walmart groceries in 2024, we can see that four \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Hawaii, and Tennessee \u2014 impose a grocery tax, adding to shoppers' expenses.\" Another factor, Pelkey said, is distribution and shipping costs. \"In Hawaii and Alaska, where shoppers pay the most for both vegan and non-vegan goods, groceries have to be shipped across long distances, which raises the prices.\"\n\nCourtesy of CashNetUSA\n\nYou can still save even if you live in an expensive Walmart state\n\n\"By understanding how prices vary by state, shoppers can plan ahead and budget effectively, especially if they are relocating or traveling for an extended period,\" Pelkey shared. \"In areas where groceries are more expensive, people might adjust their shopping habits by choosing more affordable store-brand alternatives or using coupons to help balance out high grocery costs.\"\n\nHowever, Pelkey noted those living on a state border may be in luck. \"If shoppers live near a state border,\" he said, \"they can compare prices at Walmarts in neighboring states to see if cross-border shopping might be worth it.\"",

            "content": "For all the blood sweat and tears I invested in trying to buy the viral \u201cWalmart Birkin,\u201d I\u2019m thinking I should have just attempted to buy a real one.\n\nI first began to see videos about Walmart\u2019s Birkin lookalike, or Wirkin, on TikTok during that dead zone between Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Day. The story was that Walmart had begun selling a bag from third-party sellers for around $80 that looked incredibly similar to the iconic and exclusive Birkin bag from Herm\u00e9s. According to several women who bought it, and whom I later spoke with for a story, the dupe had been available both in store and online at Walmart.\n\nThey also gave the bag rave reviews, not just as a dupe but as a nice leather tote.\n\n\u201cWhen I received it, I thought it was a very well-made bag,\u201d one happy customer told me. \u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t a dupe or an \u2018inspired\u2019 bag, I would still love it. It\u2019s great for holding a lot of items. I\u2019ve traveled with it, used it for work, and even used it to hold my groceries.\u201d\n\nAfter I finished my story, I had an idea. Why not try out the Wirkin for myself? I could no longer buy one at Walmart (the purse sold out quickly after it went viral and was never restocked), but there was another way. The bag, under brand names like Bestpr and Kamugo, was popping up in a variety of TikTok shops.\n\nSo I began what ended up being the strangest shopping experience of my life, hunting through the search results for \u201cWalmart Birkin\u201d or just \u201cBESTPR tote.\u201d Most of the shops said it would take multiple weeks for my bag to arrive, and the images seemed to be taken straight from the Walmart website, with no \u201cproof of life\u201d of actual Wirkins in hand. Basically, it was incredibly clear I could be getting scammed, but I soldiered on.\n\nI decided to also attempt to be choosy. One of the Wirkin owners I spoke to told me that her bag had come with a surprise: a dupe of an Herm\u00e9s scarf wrapped around the handles. Still other bags I saw online were decorated with the iconic Herm\u00e9s horse bag charms, which many people put on their actual Birkins.\n\nIf I was going to get a Walmart Birkin, why not go big? I found a shop that offered a bag with a scarf included, the leather a pleasant dark blue. And even though I was primarily buying the bag out of pure curiosity, there was a part of me that felt excited. Surely my bag, with its scarf and all, would pass muster enough to fool at least some of the people I passed on the streets of New York (though, most likely, not in the hallways of Cond\u00e9 Nast, the parent company of Glamour as well as publications like Vogue and Vanity Fair).",

The car washes will be free.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think everybody that steals is a bad person.

He believes 75 to 100 people eventually will be ordered to wash cars at weekend events at that location in March and April.\n\nThe judge said Walmart is \u201con board\u201d and will provide water and supplies. The company\u2019s Arkansas headquarters didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday.\n\nClothier said he was shocked to see the breadth of retail thefts when he joined the bench in January, adding that offenders were from all over Michigan and outside the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just crazy,\u201d he said, noting he had 48 such cases on his docket one day.\n\n\u201cI think it will be humiliating to be out there washing cars if you see someone you know,\u201d Clothier said.\n\nWalmart designated a parking space for police because of frequent calls about thefts, township Supervisor Scott Bennett said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an innovative approach,\u201d county Prosecutor David Leyton said of the car washes. \u201cEven if it deters one person, then there\u2019s some success there.\u201d\n\nAnd shoplifters won\u2019t be the only people up to their elbows in suds.\n\n\u201cI will be there washing cars with them,\u201d the judge said.",

            "content": "A retail business as large as Walmart U.S. with $441.8 billion in sales during fiscal 2024 incurs significant accounting and post-audit transactions given the number of suppliers, the millions of products purchased, the thousands of stores and the growing online business.\n\nPost-audit claims are part of doing business in retail. In addition to Walmart\u2019s internal post-audit work, the company hired third-party auditing firms Apex Analytics, Cotiviti, PRGX and Auditec, which review sales records and reconcile books to match supplier agreements.\n\nThe number of third-party players created several layers of scrutiny but also made the process cumbersome and transparency harder to achieve. To become more transparent, Walmart opted to go with a single third-party auditor for fiscal 2025, which began Feb. 1. The retailer asked for bids in late 2024 and United Kingdom-based Audit Partners Limited (APL) was hired. APL has audit employees based in Nepal and India and is already performing post-audit duties at Sam\u2019s Club, according to its website.\n\nUnder the former system, the external teams would look for discrepancies in prices or the allowance given for defective products, freight and handling charges on returns, and retail merchandise recovery and other shipping mistakes. When a discrepancy was found the auditor would write a post-audit claim and email documentation to the supplier.\n\nThe larger the business, the more likely a supplier is to have post-audit claims. For instance, a cosmetic company could easily have 500 SKUs (stock-keeping items) in Walmart stores. But even smaller suppliers with just a few items can also get post-audit claims that will reduce their payments unless they are successfully disputed.\n\nBentonville-based HRG is one firm that works with suppliers doing business in retail which includes Walmart, Target and Amazon. HRG CEO Boyd Evert said Walmart\u2019s goal to have greater transparency with post-audit is a noble step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen how efficient the protocol will be with a sole auditor who relies heavily on automation and auditing workers in other countries.\n\nA bigger concern is changes in the workflow process. Typically, third-party auditors would notify the supplier of claims via email communication. However, Walmart is moving to \u201cHigh Radius,\u201d a web portal system containing claim notifications and supporting documents. Evert said it\u2019s an extra step for busy suppliers to have to log into another portal daily to check for claims and pending deductions. He said smaller, busy suppliers without dedicated post-audit teams could see claims stack up in the portal and go unnoticed until deductions are made.\n\nHRG also has concerns about the automated system used by APL. Having previously worked with Walmart suppliers in South America in an automated post-audit system, Evert said machine learning and artificial intelligence tend to create more and smaller claims that could be grouped into a single claim that covers multiple stores. He said the record number of claims received for one supplier in a single day is 160.\n\nEvert said automated claims tend to be pass or fail based on wording in the supplier contract and do not account for email conversations between buyers and suppliers over specific campaigns that create areas requiring arbitration. Evert said the onus will be on suppliers to ensure contracts and correspondence are carefully worded to avoid common triggers for potential claims.\n\nHe also said complicating the workflow is Walmart\u2019s effort to make the accounting more current.\n\n\u201cSuppliers have asked for this, and Walmart is delivering. It will be a positive in time but painful for some getting there,\u201d Evert said. \u201cCompressing the window down will force more claims in the short run.\u201d\n\nHe said Walmart is supposed to announce changes to the post-audit protocol in the next few weeks.\n\nAnother aspect being changed is how the defective allowance is going to be calculated for suppliers. The Claims and Returns Systems (CARS) will look at a supplier\u2019s actual returns last year, and that will become the benchmark. For instance, if the benchmark to start is 5% and then at the end of the year they were 6%, Walmart will not go back and collect that 1% difference. If a supplier works to get returns down to 3% the next year, then 3% is the new benchmark for that coming year. The supplier will be charged if returns are higher than 3%. If returns fall as low as 1%, Walmart would then reset the allowance back up to 5%. HRG said changes to CARS allowances will be phased in starting Feb. 1.\n\nEvert said Walmart is not doing anything new or unusual, but only time will tell how it works for suppliers.\n\n\u201cWalmart is not doing anything other retailers haven\u2019t already done, and the goal to create more transparency and an up-to-date record is certainly understandable and really what best serves everyone,\u201d Evert said. \u201cIt remains to be seen if the single auditor using automation is the answer.\u201d\n\nNeither Walmart nor APL returned requests for comments about audit protocol changes.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers.

This is Brian Anderson, the Editor of City Journal. Joining me on today\u2019s show is Charles Fain Lehman. He\u2019s a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of City Journal, where his work is focused on policing, public safety, and drug abuse, among other issues. His writing has also appeared in a number of other publications, including The Atlantic, the Wall Street Journal, National Affairs, National Review, and other top publications.\n\nToday we\u2019re going to be discussing his story from our winter issue: \u201cInside the East Coast\u2019s Largest Open Air Drug Market\u201d, which is a deep look into the nightmarish conditions in Philadelphia\u2019s Kensington neighborhood.\n\nCharles, thanks very much for coming on.\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: Absolutely. Always happy to be here.\n\nBrian Anderson: You went to Kensington, yourself, to report on the situation there, and it is truly grim. But I wonder if you could just describe what the experience was like and what you saw, and even with what you knew going in, that this was a notorious area comparable to Skid Row in LA, did anything surprise you about what you saw, in terms of the realities on the ground?\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: In a certain sense, if you\u2019ve seen one drug market, you\u2019ve seen them all. But then in another sense, they\u2019re always still a shocking experience. I\u2019ve been around to two or three of these, at this point. Kensington\u2019s drug market looks a lot like many others. I should say, for context for the listeners, the Kensington drug market is the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. It is, as you alluded to, by many accounts, at least the largest open air drug market on the East Coast, possibly in the United States, depends on how you count. But so it looks exactly like a drug market does. There are people everywhere using drugs very openly, very publicly.\n\nI remember, we were walking down the street and a woman flagged us down to ask if we had a lighter, and she was holding a crack pipe in her other hand. I was like, \u201cWell, I know what you\u2019re going to use the lighter for. So no, I do not.\u201d You can see people shooting up quite publicly, people stumbling around, and drug dealing is also quite prevalent. One of the things that you notice is that these are still, sort of, commercial areas. There\u2019s a lot of like auto body shops, people selling carpets, but so much of the area is just dominated by flagrant drug use that it crowds everything else out.\n\nBrian Anderson: It\u2019s quite a disturbing narrative that you provide in this essay. Philadelphia\u2019s mayor, Cherelle Parker, was elected, a little over a year ago now, on a tough on crime platform, and she has announced a plan to end the Kensington area drug market. So far, as you described in the essay, she\u2019s carried out a street sweep of Kensington Avenue. She\u2019s passed a law or enacted a law that requires businesses to close between 11:00 PM and 6:00 AM in the morning, and then she\u2019s beefed up the police presence in the area. I wonder what you saw when you were there, was any of this in motion, and are these steps showing any results yet?\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: I was there last August, so I may be a little bit out of date. I think I saw some degree of change, but not a tremendous amount. There were a lot of government employees out and about, but much more folks who were charged with doing things like picking up needles or distributing naloxone than... There was a visible police presence, but it clearly wasn\u2019t deterring very much.\n\nThe other thing is, my informant there, the fellow that showed me around, said there has been some degree of movement off of Kensington Avenue proper. But there\u2019s clearly just displacement to the adjoining areas, Atlantic Avenue, for example. And so what you see is, not so much a cleaning up of the environment, as people moving around.\n\nThis is a common charge with policing of areas like this where critics say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re just doing displacement,\u201d and the evidence in the literature is that that can happen. It takes really a very deliberate effort to go from just displacement to really removing the drug market root and branch. The evidence, in my eyes, does not say that they had done the latter yet.\n\nBrian Anderson: One key argument you make in the essay, which is very interesting, is that for a crackdown to work, all of the steps need to be taken simultaneously, because more piecemeal efforts to shut down such markets, really just lead to suppliers changing their locations.\n\nWhat do you envision a complete shutdown looking like, and how does that prevent the dealers from just dispersing and moving elsewhere to find buyers? What would be different about a simultaneous crackdown?\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: The way to think about this is that, in the default case, policing is to think economically, part of the cost of doing business at drug dealers. You expect that a certain fraction of your project will be seized. A certain number of your dealers will be taken off the streets. That gets factored into the structure price of the final product. It\u2019s a little bit like shrinkage when you\u2019re a big box store. You just assume you\u2019re going to lose a certain amount to firings or to people stealing stuff, and that\u2019s the way that it goes.\n\nThere have been, however, a number of very successful efforts. Today, the strategy is called a drug market operation, a \u201cdrug market intervention,\u201d a DMI, that try to be more comprehensive in the way that they take down the infrastructure of the drug market. And so what you do is, instead of rounding up dealers as you see them, which you have the opportunity to, you build cases on as many dealers as you possibly can, and you bring them in all at once.\n\nOr as they did in Kensington to some success I think five years ago, you target the entire structure of distribution in a given area and take them all out at once. That\u2019s a much more intelligence-driven strategic operation. But what it does is cripple a component of the market because drug markets already pretty inefficient. They\u2019re oligopolistic. You usually only have one or two distributors. You only have a handful of guys who are doing distribution. If you can get inside of their process and disrupt them wholesale, then it\u2019s very hard for the market to recover in a way that, sort of, piecemeal policing is still relatively easy.\n\nBrian Anderson: Charles, what kind of other crimes are taking place in this area? Is it notorious for violence as well, or are these people just peacefully shooting up?\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: That\u2019s one of the interesting things. I looked at Philadelphia City data and I showed that, very conspicuously, Kensington\u2019s problem is with drugs and drugs specifically. It\u2019s about a square mile, the census tracts I use, about a square mile. That square mile of Philadelphia, which is half a percent of the city\u2019s total area, it\u2019s home to a third of reported drug law violations in 2023, a quarter of 311 calls requesting help from the city\u2019s opioid response unit, and about one in seven calls asking for camp cleanups and dealing with DUIs.\n\nThose are clearly drug-related problems, but if you look at other measures, for example, if you look at something like homicides, there were about 17 homicides in Kensington last year. That\u2019s a lot. In 2023, that\u2019s about 6 percent of what the city experienced that year, but it\u2019s not the same disproportion as you see for drug problems.\n\nThe same thing is true with maintenance complaints. Kensington is responsible for only about 3 percent of the city\u2019s total maintenance complaints. It\u2019s not exactly a safe place to be. I wouldn\u2019t recommend walking around there after dark, but on the other hand, it\u2019s not, as many people often assume, that drug use concentrates where violence also concentrates. They\u2019re distinct social problems, and the problem that Kensington has is a problem with drugs, first and foremost.\n\nBrian Anderson: Now, when you visited, did you go with police or social workers from the area, or was this just you on your own?\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: I, actually, have a contact, who works in Philadelphia journalism, who showed me around. He\u2019s been reporting from Kensington for decades, and he gave me the lay of land.\n\nBrian Anderson: I see. That\u2019s good. That sounds like a safe way to proceed. Now, many drug policy liberalizers see \u201ccontrolled consumption sites\u201d as they\u2019re called, or \u201charm reduction programs,\u201d something we\u2019ve written about a lot, as a better way to protect communities affected by drug use. Leaving the drug market confined to Kensington, on this view, might be better than the alternatives they could say. What\u2019s your response to that, and what are some of the larger social benefits that might follow closing down Kensington\u2019s drug market?\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: Yeah, and Kensington is actually A, has been the site of elicit supervised consumption sites, B, was close to one of the earliest attempts to set up a supervised illegal supervised consumption site in the United States. That one was blocked by the Trump administration, which is why the first one went up in New York, not in Philadelphia. But they tried to do it there.\n\nBrian Anderson: Just to pause for a second, Charles, maybe just explain what goes on there.\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: Well, the principle is, you should have a government-sanctioned place where people can use controlled substances under the supervision of ostensibly trained staff, sometimes with medical credentials and even naloxone, who can reverse your overdose. Proponents of these sites say nobody\u2019s ever overdosed at supervised consumption site, which is true. What also is true is that if you look at the highest quality research, they have no statistically identifiable effect on rates of overdose death.\n\nThis gets to your bigger question, which is that Kensington is this concentrated zone, like the tenderloin, like I think about Hamsterdam, from The Wire, which is the drug policy liberalizers\u2019 fantasy of, we\u2019ll just have this area where people are allowed to use drugs and that\u2019s fine.\n\nWhat happens is that they become concentrated zones of profound human misery, and it\u2019s not just that you\u2019re putting everybody in one place so it looks worse. It\u2019s that, when you put all of the drug users in one place, you get economies of scale. It becomes easier to sell to them, it becomes easier to introduce diversity. You get all of the efficiencies. You get agglomeration effects, in much the same way that putting lots of people in one place in a city yields innovation and more than linear returns. Putting a lot of people who use drugs in one area, yields innovation and more than linear returns for people who are trying to sell them drugs.\n\nAnd so dismantling these sites often yields a meaningful reduction in drug overdose deaths, a meaningful reduction in crime, because you are taking away that efficiency, right? It\u2019s not actually more humane to create an efficient way for people to slowly kill themselves. It\u2019s inhumane to do that. It\u2019s humane to make it harder for people to kill themselves.\n\nBrian Anderson: Yeah, that seems like common sense. Some of the drugs that you described were truly terrifying. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on what people are using there.\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: The thing about Philadelphia and the thing about a drug market is that if you have a very efficient drug market, you\u2019re going to end up having product diversity, in much the same way that you can buy anything you want at Walmart. And so they\u2019ve had fentanyl in Philadelphia for years and years and years. Philadelphia was also one of the first sites in the mainland United States that developed problems with xylazine, the animal tranquilizer that is now spreading across the East Coast, that\u2019s adulterating fentanyl and gives people wounds that don\u2019t heal at their injection sites.\n\nBut I talked to a guy in Kensington who routinely uses crack and fentanyl together. Or I even talked, in this conversation, we talked about friends who are using PCP, angel dust, which hasn\u2019t really been a thing since the 1980s. But apparently, you can score in Kensington. Again, this is the nature of market is when you have lots of demand, you\u2019ll end up getting niche demand at sufficient level that it\u2019s worth creating a supply, that you don\u2019t get if it\u2019s just a handful of people loosely organized.\n\nBrian Anderson: Yeah, that makes sense. The United States, final question, Charles, has been enduring a drug addiction crisis for many years now. You mentioned fentanyl. Opioids have really been at the heart of the drug crisis. I wonder what the significance of Kensington is within that broader story and what effect might shutting it down have on national trends?\n\nCharles Fain Lehman: There are two answers there. One is that when you have spaces like this, they, usually, become hubs for trafficking. I alluded to this research on something called the Kensington Initiative, where Philly PD, with the support of federal law enforcement, shut down, basically, an entire drug trafficking syndicate in Kensington. This paper shows that there are declines in drug use activity in adjoining markets in the rest of Pennsylvania and parts of Delaware. Because if Kensington gets less efficient, then it becomes less efficient of a connection for other markets. That\u2019s when you go after these big sites, you can really make the crisis better.\n\nBut there\u2019s also, I think, places like Kensington have become a touch point for the crisis. The reality, sadly, is that it is often hard to get people to care about drug overdose, drug abuse, drug death, that it\u2019s less visible. Everybody kind of knows somebody, but it\u2019s still hard to convince people that this is a problem. But people are very responsive to images of, this is what your city could look like if you don\u2019t get this problem under control.\n\nAnd so I think talking about Kensington is a way to say, look, this is what drugs do. This is not what prohibition does. This is not what social norms do. This is not what society does. This is what drugs do. If you recognize that this is a problem, which it obviously is, you should want to do something about the drug problem.\n\nBrian Anderson: Well, thank you Charles Lehman.

These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings.

Symptoms of foodborne botulism may also include vomiting, nausea, stomach pain and diarrhea.\n\n\"Botulism is a medical emergency,\" the CDC states. \"If you or your child has signs and symptoms of botulism, immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room. Do not wait.\"\n\nABC News' Melanie Schmitz contributed to this report.",

            "content": "Listen to this article Listen to this article\n\nDays after extending a request for corporate employees to relocate to either Arkansas or California, Walmart is cutting hundreds of positions at its offices in New Jersey.\n\nAccording to a filing with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the retail giant expects to eliminate 481 roles currently based in Hoboken. The cuts go into effect June 13.\n\nThe WARN filing comes less than a week after the company confirmed it is asking workers at some of its smaller corporate sites across the U.S. to move to Walmart\u2019s recently opened headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., or its office in Sunnyvale, Calif.\n\n\u201cThe 481 number referenced in the WARN notice indicates all associates affected by last week\u2019s changes, including those who have been offered relocation and the option [to] remain with the company,\u201d a Walmart spokesperson told NJBIZ.\n\nIt was not clear how many employees accepted that offer.\n\nWalmart will also close its Charlotte, N.C., office. That move will result in 267 layoffs, a local NBC News affiliate reported.\n\nThe push comes as part of a larger relocation strategy. Beginning in May 2024, Walmart asked most of its corporate staffers in Dallas, Atlanta and Toronto to move to either Bentonville, San Francisco or Hoboken. At the time, the company said the change aimed to boost \u201ccollaboration, innovation and speed.\u201d\n\nWalmart is the nation\u2019s largest private employer. While the company has not said how many employees could be impacted, hundreds of jobs are expected to be eliminated, Bloomberg reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to Reuters, employees have 30 days to inform Walmart if they plan to move and will receive relocation support from the company. If workers decide to stay put, they\u2019ll be given some type of severance package and wind down their time with Walmart by mid-year.\n\nMaking space\n\nSeveral other large corporations \u2013 including Amazon and Microsoft \u2013 are also mandating employees return to the office on a full-time basis. When Walmart shifted workers last year to California, Arkansas and Hoboken, they were told they could work remotely sometimes \u2013 as long as they are in offices most of the week.\n\nIn a Feb. 4 memo to U.S. office-based associates, Walmart Chief People Office Donna Morris wrote, \u201cOur values and culture are strategic differentiators for us as a company, and they are fostered by being together. We\u2019ve already seen the benefits of having more teams working together in person, and today we are sharing another step that will help accelerate our momentum.\u201d She went on to say the latest changes focus on putting \u201ckey capabilities together, encouraging speed and shared understanding.\u201d\n\nWalmart recently unveiled a new corporate headquarters in Arkansas, just a few miles from its previous location. According to the chain, the 350-acre campus can accommodate more than 12,000 workers across 12 buildings. The company will complete move ins by fiscal year 2026.\n\nAdditionally, Walmart will launch new office spaces later this year in Sunnyvale as well as Bellevue, Wash. The company also expects to expand and upgrade its fashion office in New York City and site in Hoboken.\n\nAccording to the company, the scope of work at Hoboken Waterfront Center includes adding two floors at its current address at 221 River St. as well as a new floor at 121 River St. More details will be provided in coming months, Walmart said.\n\nIt remains unclear how many employees work in Walmart\u2019s Hoboken office, though a spokesperson has told NJBIZ \u201cthousands\u201d of workers are based there.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated at 6:48 p.m. ET Feb. 11, 2025, to clarify that Walmart will eliminate 481 positions in Hoboken but that those employees have been given the option to relocate and remain with the company.",

We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter.\n\nClostridium botulinum is a bacteria that causes Botulism, a rare but serious illness that attacks the body's nerves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC, the bacteria can produce the toxin within foods, wounds and the intestines of infants, leading to difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis and even death.\n\n\"The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it's rare for them to make people sick,\" the CDC said. \"These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions.\"\n\nThe spores typically do not cause people to become sick, the CDC said. But under certain conditions, the spores can grow, creating \"one of the most lethal toxins known.\"\n\nThe spores can become toxic in a number of environments, including low or no oxygen, low acid, low sugar or low salt, within a certain temperature range with a certain amount of water.\n\n\"For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin,\" the CDC said. \"When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly.\"\n\nThere are five kinds of botulism, the CDC said: Foodborne, Wound, Infant, Iatrogenic and Adult intestinal, the CDC said, all of which are medical emergencies.",

            "content": "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, is the latest company to make changes to its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives under pressure from a conservative activist.\n\nThe retail giant said it would not renew a racial equity center it created following the 2020 murder of George Floyd and it would no longer participate in an annual benchmark index from LGBTQ+ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nRobby Starbuck said he warned Walmart last week he was working on a report about \u201cwokeness.\u201d According to Starbuck, the company then engaged in \u201cproductive conversations\u201d to make changes.\n\n\"Removing wokeness from Walmart has both downstream effects on suppliers and it sets the tone for corporate America,\" Starbuck told USA TODAY. \"Changing the normal operating policy at a nearly $1 trillion company is a gargantuan feat that many have tried to achieve but no one until now has actually been able to get done.\u201d\n\nWalmart also committed to monitoring third-party items in the Walmart marketplace for \u201cinappropriate sexual and/or transgender products marketed to children;\u201d reviewing all Pride funding; and no longer using the term LatinX in official communications, Starbuck said.\n\nWalmart said many of the DEI changes were in the works for a few years and were not a result of the conversation with Starbuck. For example, Walmart said it already switched its terminology from DEI to belonging and made changes to its supplier diversity program.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been on a journey and know we aren\u2019t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\" the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nTwo men fought for jobs in a town mill: 50 years later, the nation is still divided.\n\nAfter the murder of George Floyd in 2020 forced a historic reckoning with race in America, businesses pledged to make their workforces and their leadership better reflect the communities they serve.\n\nEmployees of color are underrepresented at every level of power in corporate America, according to USA TODAY data investigations. One analysis in 2023 found that white men account for 7 in 10 executive officers in the nation\u2019s largest companies. About 1 in 7 of these companies had executive teams made up only of white men.\n\nBut four years after those 2020 promises, the political landscape has shifted. Though corporate diversity efforts are broadly supported by the American public \u2013 especially younger Americans \u2013 they face growing scrutiny in the courts and in statehouses across the country as right-wing foundations, think tanks and political operatives push \u201crace-neutral\u201d policies.\n\nRIP DEI? The war on 'woke' America has a new commander-in-chief\n\nThe Supreme Court decision in 2023 to ban the consideration of race in higher education only emboldened attacks on workplace programs.\n\nPublic sentiment has also shifted. Consumer boycotts that slashed sales forced some brands like Bud Light and Target to retreat from marketing campaigns to the LGBTQ+ community. Major brands like Ford and Lowe\u2019s have abandoned initiatives and overhauled teams after pressure from Starbuck.\n\nWalmart logo is shown on the front of shopping cart at a Walmart store on May 18, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nIn conservative circles, the 2024 election is being viewed as a referendum on DEI. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to crack down on corporations that do business with the federal government.\n\nMore than 60% of corporate executives surveyed by business research group The Conference Board view today's political climate for corporate DEI as very or extremely challenging, and most expected continued or escalating pushback.\n\nEven so, fewer than 10% of the organizations planned to scale back their DEI commitments over the next three years.\n\nProponents say DEI programs are good for business, helping companies hire and retain diverse talent and create environments that boost innovation.\n\nBut business leaders are reluctant to talk about their initiatives. Major corporations including Walmart recently declined to make executives available to USA TODAY to discuss their DEI programs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Walmart rolls back DEI policies under activist pressure",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWalmart Canada announced it plans to invest 6.5 billion Canadian dollars (about $4.5 billion as of press time) into its store and supply chain footprint, according to a Jan. 30 press release.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the retailer is planning to open dozens of stores across the country, starting with opening five Supercenters in Ontario and Alberta by 2027, two of which are slated to open this year, according to the release.\n\nWalmart Canada is also planning to open a distribution center in Vaughan, Ontario, this spring.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe company\u2019s investment is the largest of its kind since Walmart Canada began operations about 30 years ago, Guilherme Loureiro, regional CEO of Walmart Canada, Chile, Mexico and Central America, said in a statement.\n\nThe investments announced in January will support the modernization and expansion of the company\u2019s Canadian supply chain. Walmart Canada announced that Canada Cartage has acquired the company\u2019s fleet business. The company declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal.\n\nWalmart Canada plans to open its Vaughan Distribution Center this spring. The retailer also plans to open multiple supercenters in locations that include Port Credit, Hopedale Mall, Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.\n\nThe investment comes on the heels of several executive appointments at Walmart Canada. Steve Schrobilgen was named Walmart Canada's chief operating officer. His responsibilities include oversight of supply chain and real estate. Schrobilgen\u2019s prior position was senior vice president and business unit leader for Walmart in the Western U.S. Also Venessa Yates was appointed CEO, previously SVP and general manager of the company\u2019s Walmart+ membership program.\n\nThe announcement also comes as Walmart Canada wraps up a prior 3.5 billion Canadian dollar investment, first announced in 2020. Under that initiative, the company said it updated more than 180 stores, added four stores in Victoria, British Columbia, and Montreal and relocated two stores in Edmonton and Vaughan, Ontario.\n\nAdditionally, the company invested 800 million Canadian dollars to open a fulfillment center and three distribution centers, including the Vaughan location. The company also touted its 200 million Canadian dollar investment last year in pay increases for Walmart Canada\u2019s frontline workers.",

Randy Blecher was sentenced to two years in prison, but the judge stayed his sentence and put him on probation. Blecher initially said he \"uses crack cocaine\" and wanted money to celebrate his birthday.\n\n\n\nA Milwaukee man was sentenced to probation after he robbed a Walmart twice, and attempted to rob it a third time because he \"uses crack cocaine\" and wanted money to celebrate his birthday at a casino.\n\nRandy Bechler, 66, was accused of robbing or trying to rob Walmart and Kohl's \u2013 and prosecutors said he admitted to four different incidents back in November 2023.\n\nHe was initially charged with four felonies. In court on Feb. 6, 2025, he pleaded guilty to armed robbery and attempted robbery with threat of force.\n\nTwo other charges of theft and attempted theft were dismissed, but read in for the purpose of sentencing.\n\nSIGN UP TODAY: Get daily headlines, breaking news emails from FOX6 News\n\nBechler was then sentenced to two years in prison and two years extended supervision, but the judge stayed that sentence and placed Bechler on three years' probation. He will have to pay $1,865 in restitution to Walmart.\n\nNovember 2023 incidents\n\nThe backstory:\n\nBechler was charged with four felonies, including armed robbery, in connection to a series of alleged crimes that happened in November 2023.\n\nThe first of the crimes happened Nov. 20, 2023 at a Walmart near 27th and Morgan. A store employee told police a man walked up to her register and ordered her to give him everything in her drawer, a criminal complaint states. The employee handed over cash, and the man left. A store manager told police the register was short more than $1,700.\n\nRelated article\n\nThe complaint states the same man returned to Walmart on Nov. 25, 2023. The man told an employee to give him money while motioning to his waistband, and the employee said she feared he had a gun. The employee handed over money from the register, and the man left. Court filings state $155 was taken.\n\nLater that same day, per the complaint, the man returned to Walmart, put his hood up and walked into the money services department. There, police said he demanded money again \u2013 but did not get any and left. An employee told police the man said he had a gun \u2013 but when she asked to see it, he \"looked shocked.\" No gun was shown during the encounter.\n\nThe man then walked through the parking lot toward Kohl's, according to prosecutors. An employee there also said a man tried to rob her, and the employee saw the man walk into a nearby apartment complex. Surveillance video from Kohl's showed a man wearing the same coat and baseball cap as the suspect in the Walmart incidents.\n\nPolice went to that apartment complex and showed someone a photo of the suspect. The complaint states that person identified the man as Bechler. Another officer responded and arrested Belcher.\n\nPolice interviewed Bechler on Nov. 26, 2023. He said, per the complaint, that he \"uses crack cocaine\" and robbed and tried to rob Walmart and Kohl's to get money to celebrate his birthday at a casino. He said he used some of the stolen money to buy crack cocaine, and identified himself on surveillance video from each incident.",

In the end, Judge Kevin Castel (S.D.N.Y.) sanctioned the attorneys, to the tune of $5,000\u2014but the national notoriety was surely far worse.\n\nThe offending lawyers, Steven Schwartz and Peter LoDuca, worked at a tiny New York law firm by the name of Levidow, Levidow & Oberman. And it seems that their screw-up stemmed in part from resource constraints, which small firms frequently struggle with. As they explained to Judge Castel at the sanctions hearing, at the time their firm did not have access to Westlaw or LexisNexis\u2014which are, as we all know, extremely expensive\u2014and the type of subscription they had to Fastcase did not provide them with full access to federal cases.\n\nBut what about lawyers who work for one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms? They shouldn\u2019t have any excuse, right?\n\nWhether they have an excuse or not, it appears that they too can make the same mistake. Yesterday, Judge Kelly Rankin of the District of Wyoming issued an order to show cause in Wadsworth v. Walmart Inc. (emphasis in the original):\n\nThis matter is before the Court on its own notice. On January 22, 2025, Plaintiffs filed their Motions in Limine. [ECF No. 141]. Therein, Plaintiffs cited nine total cases: 1. Wyoming v. U.S. Department of Energy, 2006 WL 3801910 (D. Wyo. 2006); 2. Holland v. Keller, 2018 WL 2446162 (D. Wyo. 2018); 3. United States v. Hargrove, 2019 WL 2516279 (D. Wyo. 2019); 4. Meyer v. City of Cheyenne, 2017 WL 3461055 (D. Wyo. 2017); 5. U.S. v. Caraway, 534 F.3d 1290 (10th Cir. 2008); 6. Benson v. State of Wyoming, 2010 WL 4683851 (D. Wyo. 2010); 7. Smith v. United States, 2011 WL 2160468 (D. Wyo. 2011); 8. Woods v. BNSF Railway Co., 2016 WL 165971 (D. Wyo. 2016); and 9. Fitzgerald v. City of New York, 2018 WL 3037217 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). See [ECF No. 141]. The problem with these cases is that none exist, except United States v. Caraway, 534 F.3d 1290 (10th Cir. 2008). The cases are not identifiable by their Westlaw cite, and the Court cannot locate the District of Wyoming cases by their case name in its local Electronic Court Filing System. Defendants aver through counsel that \u201cat least some of these mis-cited cases can be found on ChatGPT.\u201d [ECF No. 150] (providing a picture of ChatGPT locating \u201cMeyer v. City of Cheyenne\u201d through the fake Westlaw identifier).\n\nAs you might expect, Judge Rankin is\u2026 not pleased:\n\nWhen confronted with similar situations, courts have ordered the filing attorneys to show cause why sanctions or discipline should not issue. Mata v. Avianca, Inc., No. 22-CV-1461 (PKC), 2023 WL 3696209 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2023); United States v. Hayes, No. 2:24-CR-0280-DJC, 2024 WL 5125812 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 16, 2024); United States v. Cohen, No. 18-CR-602 (JMF), 2023 WL 8635521 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 12, 2023). Accordingly, the Court orders as follows: IT IS ORDERED that at least one of the three attorneys shall provide a true and accurate copy of all cases used in support of [ECF No. 141], except for United States v. Caraway, 534 F.3d 1290 (10th Cir. 2008), no later than 12:00 PM, Mountain Standard Time, on February 10, 2025.\n\nAnd if they can\u2019t provide the cases in question, the lawyers \u201cshall separately show cause in writing why he or she should not be sanctioned pursuant to: (1) Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b), (c); (2) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927; and (3) the inherent power of the Court to order sanctions for citing non-existent cases to the Court.\u201d And this written submission, due on February 13, \u201cshall take the form of a sworn declaration\u201d that contains \u201ca thorough explanation for how the motion and fake cases were generated,\u201d as well as an explanation from each lawyer of \u201ctheir role in drafting or supervising the motion.\u201d\n\nWho are the lawyers behind this apparent snafu? They\u2019re called out by name on page three of the order:\n\nAs you can see from the signatures on the offending motions in limine, Taly Goody works at Goody Law Group, a California-based firm that appears to have three lawyers. But Rudwin Ayala and Michael Morgan work at the giant Morgan and Morgan, which describes itself on its website as \u201cAmerica\u2019s largest injury law firm\u2122\u201d\u2014and is the #42 firm in the country based on headcount, according to The American Lawyer.\n\nMoral of the story: lawyers at large firms can misuse ChatGPT as well as anyone. And although Morgan and Morgan is a plaintiff\u2019s firm\u2014which might cause snobby attorneys at big defense firms to say, with a touch of hauteur, \u201cOf course it is\u201d\u2014I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before a defense-side, Am Law 100 firm makes a similar misstep in a public filing.\n\nThese \u201clawyers engage in ChatGPT fail\u201d stories tend to be popular with readers, which is one reason why I\u2019ve written this one\u2014but I don\u2019t want to exaggerate their significance. As I said to Bridget McCormack and Zach Abramowitz on the AAAi Podcast, \u201cChatGPT doesn\u2019t engage in these screw-ups; humans improperly using ChatGPT engage in these screw-ups.\u201d But the stories still go viral sometimes because they have a certain novelty value: AI is, at least in the world of legal practice, still (relatively) new.\n\nThe danger, however, is that the \u201cChatGPT fail\u201d stories could have a chilling effect, in terms of deterring lawyers from (responsibly) exploring how AI and other transformative technologies can help them serve their clients more efficiently and effectively. As McCormack said on the AAAi podcast after I mentioned the S.D.N.Y. debacle, \u201cI\u2019m still mad at that one Southern District of New York lawyer because I feel like he set the whole profession back by two years. I\u2019m literally so mad at that dude.\u201d\n\nI reached out to Ayala, Goody, and Morgan by email, but have not heard back yet; if and when I do, I\u2019ll update this post. Otherwise, tune in next week, when they\u2019ll file their responses to the order to show cause.\n\nAnd in the meantime, if you rely on ChatGPT or another AI tool for legal research, please, please use an actual legal-research platform to confirm that (1) the cases exist and (2) you\u2019ve cited them accurately. That\u2019s not too much to ask, right?\n\nUPDATES:\n\n5:21 p.m. : If you'd like to educate yourself about how you can leverage AI responsibly to better serve your clients, check out these excellent resources from Hotshot\u2014and you can even get CLE credit for it (depending on your jurisdiction).\n\n2/8/2025, 12:48 a.m. : The three lawyers representing the plaintiffs in Wadsworth v. Walmart withdrew their motions in limine on Friday night, as reported by Law360\u2014so presumably they know there are problems with them. But the attorneys have not yet explained why the motions contain what appear to be fabricated authorities.\n\n\n\nThe Law360 article also contains some details about the lawsuit itself: \u201cThe underlying litigation was filed in July 2023 by Stephanie and Matthew Wadsworth on behalf of their four minor children after they allege that a \u2018defective and unreasonably dangerous hoverboard\u2019 exploded and caught fire in their home. The family alleges that the product, a Jetson Plasma Iridescent Hoverboard, is defective, hazardous and malfunctioned when it was being used in the intended manner.\u201d\n\n3/8/2025, 1:13 p.m.: In the end, the lawyers got sanctioned for filing a brief full of fake citations. Judge Kelly H. Rankin (D. Wyo.) fined Rudwin Ayala $3,000, while T. Michael Morgan and Taly Goody were fined $1,000 each.\n\nThanks for reading Original Jurisdiction, and thanks to my paid subscribers for making this publication possible.

            "content": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Walmart is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.18 = US$29b \u00f7 (US$263b - US$103b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2024).\n\nTherefore, Walmart has an ROCE of 18%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Consumer Retailing industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Walmart\n\nNYSE:WMT Return on Capital Employed February 8th 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Walmart compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Walmart .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Walmart Tell Us?\n\nWalmart has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 29% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nTo sum it up, Walmart is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Walmart can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nIf you want to continue researching Walmart, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.",

Duke will stay on as chairman. McMillon, 47, marks the fifth CEO since Wal-Mart\u2019s founder Sam Walton and all of them have been home grown with years of experience before taking o ver the helm. McMillon was also elected to the company\u2019s board of directors, effective immediately.\n\nMcMillon, who succeeded Duke as head of the international business four years ago, is a 23-year company veteran. He started as a summer associate in a Wal-Mart distribution center in 1984 and then in 1990, he rejoined Wal-Mart at a Tulsa, Okla., store. He then moved up the executive ladder, working in a variety of merchandising jobs at the Wal-Mart U.S. division. Before he took over international operations, McMillon served as president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club from 2006 to 2009.\n\n\u201cThis leadership change comes at a time of strength and growth at Wal-Mart,\u201d said Rob Walton, chairman of Wal-Mart\u2019s board of directors. \u201cThe company has the right strategy to serve the changing customer around the world, and Doug has been actively involved in this process. The company has a strong management team to execute that strategy.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came just days before the kickoff of the holiday shopping season. It also comes as Wal-Mart is trying to boost sales in the U.S. and abroad amid a challenging global economy that\u2019s weighing on its low-income shoppers.\n\nIt\u2019s also confronting a host of issues that are hurting its reputation. It\u2019s grappling with allegations of bribery in its Mexico operations that surfaced in April 2012 as well as criticism over its treatment of its hourly workers. Wal-Mart is also facing pressure to increase its oversight of factory conditions abroad following a building collapse in April in Bangladesh that killed more than 1,127 garment workers. The tragedy is the deadliest incident in the history of the garment industry.\n\nDave Tovar, a spokesman at Wal-Mart said Duke\u2019s decision to leave Wal-Mart was \u201ca personal one,\u201d and he said it had nothing to do with the bribery allegations.\n\n\u201cHe decided it was time to retire,\u201d Tovar told The Associated Press. He added that Duke approached Walton and the board voted Friday.",

            "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nOn July 24, 2015, Amazon\u2019s market cap surpassed Walmart\u2019s. It took nearly 10 years for its revenue to do the same.\n\nThe once-scrappy online retailer had already expanded into cloud services and streaming video, but its revenue in that second quarter of 2015 was about one-fifth of Walmart\u2019s, at $23.2 billion.\n\nYesterday, it posted fourth quarter sales of $187.8 billion, a 10% increase. Revenue from Walmart, whose numbers are due on Feb. 20, is predicted to rise 4% to $180 billion.\n\nIt was remarkable when Amazon reached the first milestone in 2015, a lesson for a young(er) reporter on the value investors put on prospects for growth. Besides being just a fraction of the size in revenue, Amazon had only just turned consistently profitable after a period of choppy gains and losses.\n\nThe company eclipsed Walmart in profit for the first time soon after that in 2017, and has frequently surpassed it since then \u2014 and significantly so in the past 18 months.\n\nOf course, if Amazon was just a straight Walmart competitor, it wouldn\u2019t have justified the stock\u2019s climb. But it didn\u2019t just make its profits selling stuff; it sold cloud storage and eventually added fancy produce, streaming, ad services, and now, most importantly, AI hopes to its portfolio. Hopes that continue to push Amazon\u2019s trajectory far past the realms of the retail category the company completely reinvented by selling convenience as much as the goods themselves.\n\nBut just as you\u2019d be foolish to pooh-pooh Google\u2019s search or Microsoft's productivity segment (Office! Outlook!) for their flashier business segments, retail still demands respect as the biggest earner, still bigger than Amazon Web Services. While Amazon's cloud business now provides the AI buzz and the growth \u2014 sales rose 19% last quarter \u2014 it\u2019s still dwarfed by the simple retail business of selling stuff. Online sales, which don\u2019t include subsidiary Whole Foods or ad or third-party services, rose 7% to $75.6 billion.\n\nWhat has all this meant for investors?\n\nIf you bought Amazon on the very day that the market cap lines crossed, you\u2019d be up 802% compared to Walmart's 331%, which sits at a record close on Thursday. (Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained 193%.)\n\nPerhaps a fitting payoff for investors who bet on the growth story of a company that was once \"famously unprofitable.\"",

It\u2019s not just Trader Joe\u2019s; Costco\u2019s Kirkland Signature products, plus Publix and H-E-B products, among others, were also spotted on Walmart\u2019s site. Walmart and Trader Joe\u2019s did not respond to Modern Retail\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that other third-party marketplaces deal with, including Walmart\u2019s biggest competitor, Amazon. But Walmart\u2019s marketplace is still in a rapid phase of growth \u2014 its e-commerce sales were up 43% year over year in last year\u2019s third quarter \u2014 and some customers may not be aware the products they are getting aren\u2019t being sold by Walmart. It\u2019s unclear exactly who many of these resellers are, as they\u2019re often under LLCs and don\u2019t have a web presence outside of the marketplaces. Walmart reached 150,000 third-party sellers last year, according to Marketplace Pulse.\n\n\u201cA lot of customers do not know the difference, if they\u2019re shopping on Walmart.com, whether they\u2019re shopping directly from Walmart or they\u2019re shopping on a marketplace,\u201d said Blake Droesch, senior retail and e-commerce analyst for eMarketer. \u201cSo if they have a bad experience buying from some third party on a marketplace, then they could feasibly blame Walmart, and that hurts the retailer\u2019s brand image.\u201d\n\nThe sourcing methods for these items are questionable at best. \u201cThere\u2019s a million ways that these guys are getting product, and there\u2019s millions of them,\u201d said Phil Masiello, founder of powdered superfood brand Uplift Florae and CEO of revenue acceleration agency Crunchgrowth. \u201cBrands work to shut them down as best they can, but sometimes it\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d\n\nMasiello said the brands he works with often can\u2019t figure out where products being resold on Amazon are coming from. He said they could come from theft occurring while items are transported to the retailer from the manufacturer. Just last month, a California mom began a five-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to stealing millions of dollars in beauty products from Ulta Beauty and Sephora to resell on Amazon.\n\nOr, these products could come from consolidators who buy from retailers after resets, like after a store layout is redesigned. \u201cWe have one brand that we struggle with every day, and the problem is that they sell to distributors,\u201d he added. \u201cWell, the distributor will sell to anybody.\u201d\n\nWalmart has rules limiting who can sell on the platform, requiring sellers to provide documents verifying their business and have a history of success on marketplaces or e-commerce platforms, among other requirements. It prohibits the sale of stolen items and counterfeits, but some of these resellers may be in the clear.\n\n\u201cAs long as the goods are genuine, marketplaces love to have selection that is not necessarily authorized,\u201d Juozas Kaziukenas of Marketplace Pulse said in an email. \u201cWalmart can\u2019t source Trader Joe\u2019s items, but a network of sellers can, sometimes by going from store to store. The problem is ensuring the \u2018genuine\u2019 part.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for Amazon. Years ago, an Amazon executive told The Wall Street Journal that \u201cgenuine unauthorized products are something that we welcome [for] the selection and convenience and pricing that provides customers.\u201d\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s has also commented on this in the past. \u201cAt times, and more so recently, we have been aware of our products being resold, often at exorbitant prices, in various places (online and elsewhere). This is done without our approval or authorization and outside the controls of our quality-minded supply chain,\u201d the company said in 2021. \u201cTo be clear, we neither condone nor support the reselling of our products and do all we can to stop the practice.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time that something out of character has popped up on Walmart\u2019s marketplace, which has previously sold and since removed third-party sellers\u2019 sweatshirts and wig caps containing offensive words, among other questionable items. That speaks to the differences between the traditional retail model and the marketplace model, Droesch said.\n\n\u201cYou can sell a lot more products, and you don\u2019t necessarily have to worry about managing the overhead of purchasing items at wholesale. But it\u2019s also kind of like the Wild West of e-commerce,\u201d Droesch said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to maintain your brand image.\u201d",

The 8,000 cartons of eggs, worth $40,000, were taken from the back of a distribution trailer around 8:40 p.m. on Sunday. It\u2019s unclear what the thieves will do with the eggs, but the Greencastle company, which distributes organic eggs from family farms to retailers, is scrambling to beef up security. \u201cIt could happen once, it could happen again,\u201d CEO Tom Flocco said on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cWe are putting additional measures in place.\u201d Hopefully, they crack the case soon. \u2014Ally MacConchie\n\nRelated:5 things: Playing possum (with a Costco cake)\n\nGrocery bagger-slash-crooner: Twenty-nine-year-old Jordan Krolak has worked as a bagger at the Lunds & Byerlys store in White Bear Lake, Minn., for five years, according to the Fox affiliate, KMSP, there.

The whole tariff situation \u2014 in North America at least, sorry China \u2014 was put on hold by President Trump just before they were to go into effect, but the threat to Canadian workers has prompted a backlash against U.S. products, Politico reports.

The company is asking some office-based employees in Hoboken, New Jersey, and in smaller offices to relocate closer to their teams in California or Arkansas, Chief People Officer Donna Morris said in a Feb. 4 memo to associates shared with Retail Dive.\n\nAs part of the retailer\u2019s location strategy, Walmart plans to close its Charlotte, North Carolina, office. The company notified all affected employees and will provide individuals relocation support or severance.\n\nMorris said the retailer plans to open new office spaces in Sunnyvale, California, and Bellevue, Washington. It also plans to expand and upgrade offices in Hoboken and New York City.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFive years on from the outbreak of the pandemic, which drove an unprecedented shift to remote work, Walmart is among a growing list of companies accelerating a push to bring employees back to regular, in-person work in the office.\n\nAbout 480 people are affected by job cuts in Hoboken, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filed with New Jersey state officials. A similar notice filed in North Carolina indicates 201 people are impacted in Charlotte.\n\n\u201cOur values and culture are strategic differentiators for us as a company, and they are fostered by being together,\u201d Morris said in the memo. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the benefits of having more teams working together in person, and today we are sharing another step that will help accelerate our momentum.\u201d\n\nThe location-related changes are intended to increase collaboration, innovation and speed with a focus on teams working together in person.\n\nWalmart said it is adding two floors to its Hoboken office but didn\u2019t respond to questions from Retail Dive about additional closures.\n\nThe company is reshaping its corporate office footprint as it invests heavily in its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Walmart opened the first two of 12 buildings on its campus last month and the next 10 buildings will open in phases throughout the year.\n\nThis week\u2019s announcements come less than a year after Walmart asked most of its associates who worked remotely and in offices in Dallas, Atlanta and Toronto to relocate.

            "content": "A suspect accused of shooting and wounding a Walmart employee during a robbery was caught in part because he left his wallet in a rideshare he took to the store, according to an arrest report.\n\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police took Taron Jefferson into custody on Tuesday on suspicion of attempted murder, robbery with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery, per arrest and court records.\n\nIn an arrest report, LVMPD wrote that officers were dispatched to a Walmart on Blue Diamond Road on Monday, Feb. 3. Someone called 911 saying a man stole wine and flowers, got into a car and drove through the parking. A second person got out of another car and asked about his friend, the first suspect. Walmart employees followed the second person when a caller said an employee was shot.\n\nThe victim was taken to UMC with a gunshot wound to the left leg, according to the report. At UMC, he told police that the man was inside the Walmart after it closed and store managers escorted him to leave. He took three bottles of wine and a bouquet of flowers. The managers tried to follow him to get the merchandise back, but he got into a car that left heading east.\n\nA second person, whom police identified as Taron Jefferson, then appeared looking for the first man. Employees followed Jefferson through the parking lot when they heard four shots and saw Jefferson allegedly firing in their direction.\n\nDetectives learned both men arrived at the Walmart in an Uber. The driver said he picked them up and one man went into the Walmart while Jefferson stayed behind, according to the report.\n\nThe driver said that when he noticed the first man stealing from the Walmart, he asked Jefferson to leave his car, but \"Jefferson reached into his waistband as if he had a weapon and told him, 'You are not going anywhere,'\" the report states. The driver said he began calling 911 and Jefferson got out.\n\nAs the driver waited for police, he said he received a message from Jefferson asking to pick up his wallet left in the back seat. The driver gave the wallet to police officers, who saw that it had Jefferson's driver's license inside.\n\nWhile responding to the shooting, police got a report of a suspicious person nearby and the description matched Jefferson. Officers arrived and took him into custody.\n\nCourt records indicate Jefferson is being held on $150,000 bail. If he posts bond, he would be subject to high-level electronic monitoring. An initial appearance hearing was scheduled for Thursday morning.",

Over the years, drivers have hit the rock, recently leading to rumors of its removal. \"The Rock\" has its own Facebook page with over 4,200 followers and you can even find its location on Google Maps.\n\n\n\nWhat makes your hometown different than the rest? In Cambridge, many residents will tell you a rock near the parking lot of the city\u2019s Walmart is a landmark and something that sets the city apart.\n\nWalmart rock in Cambridge\n\nWhat we know:\n\nMove over Target, your red ball could have some rigid competition.\n\nA large rock sits in the grass next to the curb near the parking lot of Walmart in Cambridge. Known as \"The Walmart Rock\", it has been a familiar sight for employees and shoppers who frequent the store.\n\n\"Everybody knows the Walmart rock,\" Isanti County resident Jill Arnoldy said. \"It's kind of like the icon of Cambridge.\"\n\nThe man. The myth. The legend.\n\n\"I think we should name it rocky,\" 9-year-old David Leonhard said. \"Rocky Jones.\"\n\nCounty residents don\u2019t take their rockstar, Rocky Jones, for granite.\n\n\"Imagine this is Wisconsin coming out,\" Arnoldy said as she moved her hands around The Rock, pointing to all the veins. \"This is the state of Minnesota with the upper region here going towards North Dakota.\"\n\nOver the years, many people have taken pictures with The Rock and have even celebrated with it on holidays like the Fourth of July and Easter. Many residents share their photos on its Facebook page: Walmart Rock of Cambridge.\n\nThat\u2019s where you\u2019ll find any updates about The Rock. More than four thousand Facebook users follow the big rock on the platform. Just recently, Grant, a Walmart manager, was seen hugging The Rock surrounded by orange construction cones.\n\nThe Rock was moved to a parking space in the back of the parking lot after a Walmart semi-truck hit it. A photo was captured of the semi on top of it.\n\nA hard rock life\n\nDig deeper:\n\nThe Walmart semi was just the latest vehicle to collide with The Rock. Over the years, there have been a handful of drivers that have hit The Rock. This has led to many rumors about a potential move.\n\n\"I would not be happy if it were to be moved,\" Walmart shopper Adrian Musceus said.\n\nResidents are used to seeing a landmark that has been in the same location for nearly 10 years. And if it had to be moved, people would try to change that.\n\n\"That would be like taking down a statue in town,\" Arnoldy said.\n\nA petition called \"Protect the Walmart Rock of Cambridge!\" was created by another county resident. It has over 200 signatures.\n\nJust across the intersection near Walmart sits the Isanti County Historical Society. Sam Klocksien is the executive director of the non-profit. The building houses the county\u2019s history.\n\n\"We're the county's attic in a sense,\" Klocksien joked. \"We get a lot of things but if it's relative to the county's history, and it tells a story, we're all about it.\"\n\nKlocksien\u2019s 13-year-old self would\u2019ve pinched himself had he known he was going to be emersed in history as the executive director at the Isanti County Historical Society. But what might\u2019ve shocked him more is the rock he would be offering to make space for to add to the county\u2019s collection.\n\n\"I just thought, you know, why not here?\"\n\nKlocksien offered to take The Rock as the newest addition to the Isanti County Historical Society. Although it might not seem historic now, he said you have to think of what could possibly become historic decades from now.\n\n\"People might think-- Oh it's just a rock, who cares? Move on with life,\" Klocksien said. \"Then you get this group that's like-- it's neat, and it's kind of like a symbol maybe of perseverance or maybe it's a metaphor for the area. It\u2019s like a bull in a rodeo that's kind of done its time, and now it's time to put it out to pasture and let it just live out its life in peace.\"\n\nMeaning behind The Rock\n\nLocal perspective:\n\nHave these pebbles lost their marbles?\n\nMaybe.\n\n\"It\u2019s funny and crazy,\" 9-year-old David Leonhard said. \"It's a little weird if you think about it.\"\n\nMaybe not.\n\nResidents will tell you it\u2019s not just a rock.\n\n\"It\u2019s like THE ROCK in capital letters,\" Arnoldy said.\n\n\"It\u2019s kind of like a landmark at this rate. It's like Cambridge's face,\" shopper Musceus said.\n\nMusceus stopped by Walmart with his friend Jade Remackel. The two heard the rock was going to be moved back to its original spot, so they had to make sure they were there to see it.\n\n\"I was like, yeah they're putting the rock back!\" Remackel said.\n\nRemackel and Musceus have had conversations about The Rock for a very long time. The two have kept up with any updates on it.\n\nRock moved back and the crowd goes wild\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"I was cheering on. I was like heck yeah! The Rock is getting its dedication it deserves,\" Musceus said moments after watching The Rock being moved by DW Companies, an excavation business in town.\n\nNo job is too big, no job is too small. DW Companies had the hefty task of moving The Rock just a stone\u2019s throw away to its original spot.\n\n\"It\u2019s gained a lot of publicity when people run their vehicles up on it or a semi,\" Nathan Bostrom, with DW Companies, said.\n\nBostrom and a few other DW Companies employees dropped cones around parts of the parking lot as they prepared to move The Rock.\n\n\"People are yelling, driving by,\" he said.\n\nA few people watched as DW worked.\n\nDavid Leonard was one of them. He learned about The Rock from his mom.\n\n\"She just showed me a bunch of pictures over the years,\" the 9 year old said. \"It\u2019s a rock it's just, wow. A rock became famous. Just wow.\"\n\nAs Leonard watched DW, he really started to think about how so many drivers hit The Rock.\n\n\"The rock is on the grass so how did they hit the rock? That's my question here.\"\n\nJoin the club, David. So many people have questioned how this happens.\n\n\"Maybe they're on their phones while they\u2019re looking. I don't know.\"\n\nDespite the run-ins, many people in the community want The Rock to stay where it\u2019s been for nearly 10 years because they say its what makes this community different.",

The new fund is focused on investments in solutions that boost long-term sustainability in the seafood industry.\n\n\u201cThis is a great achievement for us,\u201d Simen Landmark, a partner at Bluefront Equity, told Impact Investor. \u201cIt is a clear mark of quality when such a renowned investor invests in us from the other side of the world.\u201d\n\nWalton founded Builders Vision in 2021 as an impact platform with the aim to use philanthropic capital, investment and advocacy to support people and organisations building \u201ca more humane and healthy planet\u201d, with a particular focus on oceans, energy, and food and agriculture. According to Forbes, the firm has deployed $3bn since its inception.\n\nThe Bluefront Equity team, with left to right: Simen Landmark, Kjetil Haga, Johan Kostveit, Sondre Storli\n\nBuilders Vision is also working with Bluefront on forming an impact advisory council to boost the firm\u2019s impact management and measurement efforts, the firm said.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we met with Builders Vision and learned about their focus on advancing the blue economy and transforming food systems, we saw strong synergies between our goals and approach,\u201d said Kjetil Haga, partner and CEO at Bluefront. \u201cIt was clear that their expertise in these areas would complement ours, and we thought that they would be an excellent partner for us.\u201d\n\nAquatic gene freezing\n\nAs reported by Impact Investor in May 2024, Bluefront closed its first seafood fund in 2021 after raising $62m. It has almost doubled its fundraising target for its second fund to around NOK 1.25bn (\u20ac110m), and is aiming to close the vehicle this summer, according to Landmark, a former investment banker in Norway who co-founded Bluefront Equity with Haga in 2020.\n\n\u201cShifting the value chains of major industries with practical, scalable solutions\u2014like those in Bluefront\u2019s portfolio\u2014is essential for building a sustainable blue economy that can economically thrive while having an outsized positive impact,\u201d said James Lindsay, investment director at Builders Vision.\n\nExisting investors in Bluefront\u2019s first fund, including the Bergersen family\u2019s Havfonn foundation, the Steensland group, the 3S Invest family office, Klaveness Marine, TD Veen and Nordic private equity firm Cubera, also participated in Bluefront Capital II. Among the fund\u2019s international investors are US-based asset manager Commonfund, and global investment firm Cambridge Associates.\n\nGetting Builders Vision on board has had \u201cpositive benefits for us, also fundraising-wise\u201d, said Landmark. Bluefront is currently involved in three different due dilligence processes with other known impact investors, Landmark added.\n\nBluefront\u2019s second fund has already invested in two companies. Cryogenetics is a specialist in aquatic gene preservation, which freezes the genetic materials of, for example, salmon and trout in Norwegian rivers for biodiversity purposes. Horizon Software offers digital solutions that optimise biological conditions and production for fish farmers.\n\n\u201cBy investing in companies tackling critical challenges such as fish welfare, ocean health, and sustainability, they\u2019re improving efficiency, reducing mortality, and addressing issues like lice, disease, and waste\u2014all while driving strong returns and supporting long-term ocean resilience,\u201d said Lindsay.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nWalmart is now the proud owner of a shopping mall near Pittsburgh, the company confirmed to Retail Dive Tuesday. It plans to redevelop the Monroeville Mall and Annex in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, in partnership with Cypress Equities, a Texas-based real estate and development firm.\n\n\u201cWalmart did purchase the Monroeville Mall and is very interested in being part of any future redevelopment of this site,\u201d the retailer said in a Tuesday statement. \u201cWalmart is working with Cypress on mall operations and potential redevelopment of the site.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time the company acquired an operating mall of this size, Walmart told Retail Dive. The company said it was unable to share specific plans about the Monroeville Mall project.\n\nThe mall deal further builds on Walmart\u2019s store expansion plans. In 2023, the company said it invested over $500 million to update 117 stores. Then last year, the company announced an expansive, five-year plan to build or expand 150 locations and remodel 650 stores. The new and remodeled stores will feature expanded product selections and improved layouts, as part of a larger goal to enhance store growth.\n\nCypress CEO Chris Maguire told Retail Dive in an email they're in the initial planning stages and will spend the next several months evaluating redevelopment options. Because the work is still in the early stages, Maguire said there's no project timeline yet.\n\nCBL Properties said Friday that it sold the Monroeville Mall and Annex for $34 million. The 1.2 million-square-foot property occupies 186 acres and is near an existing commercial corridor. It sits at the junction of several major highways, including U.S. 22, Interstate 376 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike.\n\nBuilt in 1969, the mall\u2019s last renovation was in 2003, the Monroeville Times Express reported in December. CBL bought the mall in 2004 for $231.2 million, according to news reports from that time. In a statement Monday, Cypress said \u201cthe property is well suited for a major redevelopment and repositioning into a mix of uses including retail and entertainment, restaurants, residential, hospitality, office, and public spaces.\u201d\n\nLocated about 15 miles east of Pittsburgh, the two-story Monroeville Mall has more than 130 stores, including Macy\u2019s, Best Buy, J.C. Penney, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Barnes & Noble and a Cinemark theater. In 2023, CBL said the mall had nearly 3.5 million annual visits.\n\nCBL also owned the adjacent Annex at Monroeville, an open air shopping center, with eight more stores, including a Dick\u2019s-owned Going Going Gone and music retailer Guitar Center.\n\nSome retailers have sought to move out of shopping malls in recent years as traffic has declined, though some centers continue to thrive.\n\nThe mall and annex\u2019s trade area is over 420,000 people, who have an average household income of about $83,000, according to Placer.ai data. The Monroeville Veterans Affairs Clinic opened on the mall property in 2023 and two other hospitals operate nearby, as do about a dozen colleges and universities.\n\nCiting its experience in redeveloping underutilized malls and commercial centers, Dallas-based Cypress said the Monroeville Mall is a good candidate for a major mixed use redevelopment that could see its current slate of retail and restaurant offerings augmented with residential, hospitality and office spaces.\n\n\u201cWe believe this redevelopment will create a vibrant and dynamic destination that serves the community and drives economic growth in the region,\u201d Maguire said.",

For example, beauty products maker Est\u00e9e Lauder said Tuesday it was eliminating as many as 7,000 jobs following a drop in sales in markets around the world, while Salesforce is reportedly cutting more than 1,000 positions.\n\nAs PYMNTS reported last month, the number of Americans receiving unemployment insurance reached a three-year high during the second week of January.\n\nAround the same time, the University of Michigan\u2019s January Surveys of Consumers found a drop in consumer sentiment, driven by concerns about inflation and unemployment.\n\nThe latest PYMNTS Intelligence reveals that 65% of consumers are living paycheck to paycheck, with 24% struggling to pay their bills.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nearly a quarter of Americans playing an exhausting game of financial whack-a-mole, deciding which bills to pay in full, which to pay partially and which to outright ignore until the next paycheck arrives,\u201d PYMNTS wrote earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThis financial strain has led many to prioritize immediate survival over long-term financial planning, with a significant portion of American consumers adopting short-term, reactive strategies to manage their financial obligations.\u201d",

It is also seeking to relocate some employees from its Hoboken, N.J., offices. Last year, reports indicated that the company was relocating some employees to the Sunnyvale and Hoboken facilities from other smaller, regional outposts, such as the ones in Dallas, Atlanta, and Toronto.\n\nLast year, Walmart also initiated a policy requiring many employees who worked remotely to begin spending most of their time in the office, the reports said.\n\nThe company\u2019s new headquarters includes 12 buildings on 350 acres of property and what the company described as a sustainable design that includes walking and biking trails and 13 acres of lakes. The new campus has officially opened this year, beginning with a merchandising team that relocated there in January, according to information on Walmart\u2019s website.\n\nIt was not immediately known how many positions were being eliminated and how many employees were relocating as a part of the Charlotte office closure.

            "content": "How corporate America got DEI wrong\n\ntoggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nFive years ago, in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the sweeping reckoning on racism it sparked, corporate America rushed to join in.\n\nBig businesses started making big \u2014 and expensive \u2014 promises to fight racism and increase diversity. Walmart, the world's largest company, spent $100 million on a new center on racial equity \u2014 and that was just one of many such investments.\n\nAll told, the country's largest companies pledged almost $50 billion toward addressing racial inequality in the year after Floyd's death, The Washington Post estimated in 2021. And their CEOs announced these promises with solemn rhetoric about their companies' roles in fixing societal problems.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We want to address systematic racism in society head-on and accelerate change,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in June 2020.\n\nBut today, corporate America is rushing just as quickly in the other direction. Mounting political and legal attacks have turned DEI \u2014 diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 from a corporate rallying cry to a politically toxic football.\n\nMany big companies had been backing away from their diversity promises even before President Trump was reelected. After long criticizing DEI, Trump last month signed executive orders that will terminate what he calls \"illegal\" DEI programs and policies throughout the federal government. He called the programs \"radical and wasteful\" and discriminatory against nonminorities who, he says, are denied opportunities and recognition as a result.\n\nTrump continued these criticisms last week, suggesting \u2014 apparently without evidence \u2014 that DEI programs at the Federal Aviation Administration were to blame for a deadly airliner crash.\n\nIt may seem that big companies are just adapting to political and legal pressure, but diversity experts also blame a more fundamental failure: Many businesses didn't think through their pledges \u2014 or their costs \u2014 from the start, they say. So corporate America may have never gotten DEI right in the first place.\n\n\"What we're seeing in the moment is the few companies who took it to heart \u2026 and the many who just wanted to sprinkle some DEI on top, especially after George Floyd,\" says Portia Allen-Kyle, who runs the racial justice nonprofit Color of Change. \"And that was never going to be a viable strategy.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAllen-Kyle is pretty pessimistic these days about the future of DEI in corporate America, and the fallout for Black and other minority workers.\n\nBut some diversity experts see a silver lining from the scrutiny: They hope that companies that care about building fairer, more inclusive workplaces are rethinking their strategies \u2014 and may now finally have a chance to get it right.\n\n\n\nHow corporate America retreated from DEI\n\nConservative critics have long claimed that DEI is itself discriminatory. But these attacks picked up momentum in 2023, when the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action at colleges and universities, ending the consideration of race in college admissions.\n\ntoggle caption Jim Watson/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThat ruling handed a powerful legal weapon to anti-DEI voices like Robby Starbuck, a social media influencer who has successfully pressured several big companies to end diversity-focused programs. Starbuck has said he is focused on ending \"wokeness\" in corporate America and has posted on X that his activism will give workers \"a neutral workplace without feeling that divisive issues are being injected.\"\n\nNow President Trump's efforts to end DEI in the federal government are expected to ripple into the private sector. Walmart, Meta, Amazon and many others have already joined the retreat, ending many of their 2020-era pledges and programs. For example, Walmart in November said it won't renew the funding for its racial equity center and that it will end some other diversity-focused programs.\n\n\"We remain committed to creating a culture where everyone can be successful, and ensuring we are a Walmart for everyone,\" a company spokesperson tells NPR.\n\nThe other companies have said similar things. For example, in a note shared with NPR, Amazon executive Candi Castleberry told employees last year that \"we remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world.\" (Meta did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe \"business case for diversity\" is complicated\n\nUnder the political headlines, there's a more subtle undercurrent at work.\n\nWhen Floyd was murdered, many big companies were already promoting themselves as leaders in society, not just business. This widespread trend was known as \"stakeholder capitalism\": Companies argued that they could do more to help workers, society and the planet, while also making more money for investors.\n\nBut many experts saw this rhetoric as fundamentally flawed \u2014 and, it soon turned out, largely ineffective. Paying workers more inevitably costs money and cuts into short-term profits; so does turning down business opportunities that could have a negative impact on the environment. Meanwhile, CEOs who take stands on social or environmental issues risk drawing the ire of politicians and customers who disagree.\n\n\"It is always going to be difficult, if you are a for-profit publicly traded company, to have your leader talk about anything other than maximizing profits,\" says Sekou Bermiss, an associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"That is, in the U.S., the way we are wired.\"\n\nBut when Floyd was murdered, big companies had raised the expectations of employees and customers that they would take a stand. And Bermiss argues that many rushed into promises without thinking through the costs \u2014 or what made the most sense for each individual business. Instead, some companies relied too much on the prospect of financial rewards for DEI programs, or what became known as \"the business case for diversity.\"\n\n\"It was being pitched as 'Diversity is always going to help the bottom line,' Bermiss says. \"But no one [who studies this] would ever say that.\"\n\nIndeed, although some analysts have made the business case for diversity, Bermiss' research has found that when companies increase the diversity of their executive teams, they generally don't see a financial impact \u2014 good or bad.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nThe \"ethical case for diversity\" is stronger\n\nStill, Bermiss and others point out that DEI policies can have significant business impacts, even if they're not apparent in short-term financial results. Having a more diverse team can help create products that appeal to more consumers, or help employees feel more satisfied with their jobs.\n\nCostco, for example, recently told investors that its DEI efforts \"help bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings\" and \"enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed,\" among other benefits.\n\nThe massive retailer, which also calls DEI part of its \"code of ethics,\" successfully brushed off an anti-DEI shareholder proposal last month. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who runs the nation's largest bank, has called DEI \"good for business; it's morally right; we're quite good at it; we're successful.\"\n\ntoggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nIt probably helps that both JPMorgan Chase and Costco are financial powerhouses, whose profits and share prices keep their investors happy. But both companies are also framing their DEI policies as a matter of morality or ethics, rather than just profits.\n\nThat's exactly how more companies should be thinking about DEI, according to Bermiss \u2014 if (and only if) they see it as valuable. Bermiss acknowledges that not all companies will want to continue pursuing greater diversity, equity and inclusion. But he argues that if business leaders decide that pursuing such workplace goals is morally right and aligned with a company's values, then they'll be better able to stand up to criticisms or attacks.\n\nAnd, as he adds, that's firmer ground than hoping that \"if we get two more Latinos on the board, our stock price will go up.\"\n\n\n\nSome DEI work will continue \u2014 by any other name\n\nDespite the ongoing pressures, Costco and JPMorgan aren't the only employers still spending money on DEI. In fact, some companies are ramping up: Paradigm, a tech consultancy that advises employers on diversity and inclusion, says it saw a 12 percentage-point increase last year in how many of its customers had dedicated DEI budgets.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nParadigm CEO Joelle Emerson says that even companies that are ending DEI programs may rebrand the work rather than abandoning it altogether. Corporate America's diversity results have been \"a mixed bag,\" she adds, \"in part because companies often spent too much time and energy on initiatives that didn't have a measurable impact.\"\n\nNow she's hoping that employers are taking the time to create more thoughtful \u2014 and effective \u2014 programs to increase fairness.\n\n\"I see this less as a rollback of DEI and more as sort of an evolution to the next phase of this work,\" Emerson says.\n\nMany of the companies ending DEI programs are scrubbing the now-politically toxic acronym from their websites and corporate statements. But their public statements insist that they still want to make everyone feel included.\n\nThat could be a tricky balance, especially as the Trump administration continues ramping up attacks on DEI \u2014 including efforts to uncover rebranded diversity efforts inside federal agencies.\n\nAnd it remains to be seen whether corporate America can really be more effective while softening its language \u2014 and goals \u2014 around diversity, equity and inclusion. But Emerson, at least, is bullish.\n\n\"I'm actually pretty optimistic about the future of this work,\" she says. \"I'm not optimistic about the acronym DEI \u2014 nor do I particularly care.\"",

Dispatch advised that an asset protection associate stated there was a woman, later identified as 46-year-old Jennifer Janine Brown, inside the store putting items in her personal bag. The officer later met her outside the general merchandise door of the store.\n\nThe associate explained that while performing his routine duties, he saw Brown picking out merchandise from inside the business and putting them in her bag. She proceeded to the pharmacy section where she selected a bottle of lotion and put it in her bag. She tried to leave the store without paying for any of the items, but she was stopped by an associate in the garden section, the report said.\n\nBrown walked back through the store toward self-checkout. While there, she paid for a bag of oranges and diapers. She did not pay for four Dove lotions valued at $4 each. She then walked out of the store, and the associate contacted the LPD, the report said.\n\nBrown did not want to speak with the officer but asked if she would be receiving a misdemeanor citation for the offense, the report said. When she was told she would not be taken to Lake County Jail, she stated, \u201cI guess they not giving tickets for theft anymore.\u201d\n\nThe officer reviewed surveillance footage of the incident which confirmed the associate\u2019s story. The recovered items were turned over to Walmart, the report said.\n\nA criminal history check showed Brown was previously found guilty of at least two prior theft charges, including larceny petit theft in July 2005 and April 2004, the report said.\n\nBrown was subsequently arrested on charge of retail theft (felony \u2013 two or more prior theft). The New York native was transported to Lake County Jail and released after posting $2,500 bond.",

            "content": "What this retailer lacks in growth potential it more than makes up for in raw, category-leading muscle.\n\nAre you looking for a new stock pick with relatively low risk, even if that means muted gains? Take a look at Walmart (WMT 1.01%), even at its recently reached record high.\n\nYou know the company. Walmart is of course the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, operating more than 10,000 stores collectively generating on the order $670 billion worth of annual sales. That's impressive given the company's modest start as a single store a little more than 60 years ago.\n\nSheer size and a solid track record alone aren't enough reason to step into any particular stock, though; plenty of other companies boast equally impressive bullish arguments.\n\nRather, there are four specific reasons this discount retailer is poised to remain the dominant name in the business, and reward shareholders as a result.\n\n1. The company is evolving into a lifestyle brand\n\nPrior to the advent of e-commerce 30 years ago, Walmart mostly served a utilitarian purpose. Simply having an item on a store shelf at an acceptable price was good enough for most consumers. There were few frills, nor did shoppers expect them. Experiential browsing was left up to department stores and malls.\n\nThat's not the case anymore, though. Lines are being blurred, with more and more consumers valuing (and even paying for) convenience, but also expecting something of an experience wherever they're shopping.\n\nWell, Walmart's delivering -- figuratively as well as literally. Its Walmart+ membership program offers free delivery of certain online orders, for example, making it competitive with Amazon Prime. In-store shoppers will also see more mannequin displays and mini shops featuring premium apparel or home goods, akin to mall-based department stores' look and feel.\n\nIt's hardly stopping there, however. Private label wine, technology installation service, and veterinary services are just some of the ways the retailer has tinkered with deepening its everyday relationships with customers to become and remain a top-of-mind option. It even now owns smart-television maker Vizio, presumably to leverage its reach as an advertising medium.\n\nNot all of these net-widening experiments have panned out as hoped, to be clear. But enough of them are working out.\n\n2. Even affluent households now like the value it offers\n\nWhen inflation was soaring just a couple years ago, Walmart frequently highlighted how the bulk of its market share gains were coming from households earning in excess of $100,000 per year -- a sliver of consumers the company hadn't necessarily done all that well with in the past. But when money is tight, it's tight for everyone.\n\nWhat's interesting, however, is now that inflation is finally abating, these same affluent shoppers are sticking around. As CEO Doug McMillion said, \"households earning more than $100,000 made up 75% of our share gains.\" Curiously, Target -- which had historically done well with this crowd by being able to offer \"cheap chic\" looks -- is now losing these customers to Walmart, with the lousy same-store sales numbers to prove it.\n\nIf this is the new norm, Walmart should continue outgrowing its competition as it improves its understanding of these affluent consumers, and better cater to their lifestyle expectations.\n\n3. Walmart is gaining e-commerce market share (even on Amazon)\n\nThere's no denying Walmart initially dropped the ball on the e-commerce, allowing Amazon to establish a foothold en route to dominance that could have at least been partially curbed. Now Walmart is playing catch-up, from a defensive position.\n\nIt is catching up, though. After investing billions of dollars in its e-commerce platform before and during this period, market research outfit Digital Commerce 360 says Walmart's share of the United States' online-shopping market has grown from 2017's 4.4% to around 10.6% now. That's still minuscule compared to Amazon's share of 39.7%, but that figure's only up from 36.4% seven years back.\n\nConnect the dots. Walmart is out-gaining Amazon, capturing more of this still-growing sliver of the retailing industry.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, there's plenty of opportunity ahead. eMarketer predicts the nation's e-commerce market will grow at an average annual pace of nearly 9% through 2028, with Walmart's online business expected to outgrow all other major players in this space -- including Amazon -- to end up 31% bigger at the end of the four-year stretch.\n\n4. Its massive size is making a difference\n\nFinally, although the biggest companies in a particular industry aren't inherently that industry's best investments, there's a reason these companies have been able to surpass all of their competitors as Walmart has. It's also much easier to maintain a dominant position than it is to earn one, simply because that organization has more fiscal muscle to flex, and existing reach to leverage.\n\nIt's admittedly not fair to rivals like Target, Kroger, or others. As an investor, however, you don't want a fair fight. You want the companies you own to be able to push their competitors around.\n\nJust understand what this investment will be, and won't be\n\nWalmart may be the pick of the litter for the consumer/retailing category of stocks. That doesn't mean it's a must-have pick for you, though. Again, with its lower risk you'll likely see less reward than you might with a more familiar growth stock like the aforementioned Amazon. Define your goal first, and then choose stocks accordingly. If you'll gladly exchange upside potential for consistency and certainty, Walmart is a solid bet.\n\nYou'll also be paying a bit of a premium for it, by the way. Walmart shares are currently priced richly about 35 times the coming year's expected earnings, and only a hair under analysts' consensus price target of $100.31.\n\nThe thing is, you should expect and be willing to pay a premium for quality like this stock offers.\n\nThis might help: Despite Walmart stock's oversized gains for the past couple of years, the vast majority of the analyst crowd still rates it as a strong buy even at its lofty valuation.",

(NYSE:WMT) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now.\n\nA notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China\u2019s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market\u2019s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nFor example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company\u2019s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

            "content": "The FDA shared the classification of a recent broccoli recall affecting Walmart stores in 20 states.\n\nThe recall, prompted by potential listeria contamination, is officially a Class 1 recall, which means it poses a high risk.\n\nThe recall was pending classification when it was originally announced.\n\nEarlier this month, broccoli was recalled from Walmart due to possible listeria contamination. On January 27, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the recall classification to Class 1, meaning consumption of the affected products poses a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of \u201cserious adverse health consequences or death.\u201d\n\nThe recalled Braga Fresh Marketside Broccoli was washed, ready-to-eat, and sold in 12-ounce bags at Walmart stores in 20 states including Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\n\nThe bagged produce\u2019s best-by date has already passed\u2014it expired in December, the FDA pointed out. However, the recall is ongoing to inform people who still have the product or may have frozen it for future use. If you think you might have affected product, look for a UPC code of 6 81131 32884 5 on the back of the package, a Best if Used by Date of December 10, 2024, and a Lot Code of BFFG327A6 on the package front. If you believe you have affected product, the FDA recommends disposing of it immediately. The recall does not apply to any other Marketside or Braga Fresh produce products.\n\n\n\nThe listeria contamination was discovered during a random sampling by Texas Health & Human Services. Listeria are bacteria that can contaminate food and cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems, per the FDA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms of infection may include flu-like muscle aches and fatigue, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. In pregnant people, infection may cause miscarriages and stillbirths.\n\nThis classification update may seem severe or delayed, but it\u2019s all part of the FDA\u2019s communication process. According to the agency\u2019s website, it began listing recalls pending classification in June 2017 \u201cto alert the public sooner.\u201d In other words, when necessary, the FDA notifies the public of voluntary recalls made by retailers and/or manufacturers, and then proceeds to complete its own assessment of hazard. Once that assessment is finished, the recall is updated with a classification between Class 1 and Class 3, Class 1 being the most serious of the three.\n\nThe broccoli recall was unclassified when it was announced in early January, so this news isn\u2019t of a heightened risk but rather, is an official notice of risk overall.",

In 2024, the company also invested nearly $200 million in wage increases for its frontline workers.\n\nA fourth DC included in this 2020 round of investment, the Vaughan Distribution Centre, will open this spring.

Known for everyday low prices, it operates through Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sam\u2019s Club and is valued at a robust market cap of $792.5 billion.\n\nShares of this retail giant have outpaced the broader market considerably over the past year. WMT has gained 78.7% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 23.3%. In 2025, WMT stock is up 9.2%, surpassing SPX\u2019s 3.2% rise on a YTD basis.\n\nZooming in further, WMT has also surpassed the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 16.3% over the past year and a 2.6% return in 2025.\n\nWalmart's strong rise over the past year has been fueled by its expanding e-commerce segment, which is projected to turn profitable within the next one to two years, driven by digital advertising and its online marketplace. Additionally, Walmart has gained substantial market share, including from higher-income households seeking value, solidifying its position as a leader in the retail sector.\n\nOn Nov. 19, Walmart posted its third-quarter earnings report, and its shares rose 3%. Both its top line and bottom line surpassed the market\u2019s expectations, and the company also raised its fiscal 2025 guidance, forecasting adjusted EPS between $2.42 and $2.47.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in January 2025, analysts expect WMT\u2019s EPS to grow 11.7% to $2.48 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 36 analysts covering WMT stock, the consensus is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 29 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, four \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d and three \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is less bullish than three months ago, with 30 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 21, Morgan Stanley (MS) raised Walmart's price target to $106 from $100 while maintaining an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating, citing its scale, investment in next-gen retail tech, and leadership in its segment as key strengths in the 2025 retail outlook.\n\nThe mean price target of $99.92 represents a 1.3% premium to WMT\u2019s current price levels.

I\u2019m obsessed with window-shopping trendy styles to potentially splurge on someday, and I currently own a few name-brand pairs from Adidas, New Balance and Brooks. And while they\u2019re all very supportive, comfortable and stylish, I regularly don\u2019t have the means to spend much on replacements when they get worn down.\n\nThat\u2019s why I was ecstatic to find this new $25 pair from Walmart that looks very similar to my $140 Brooks sneakers. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I love my Brooks and constantly recommend them to friends, but I\u2019ve also let them in on these under-the-radar, high-quality low-cost sneakers.\n\nAvia Gel Sneaker\n\nWalmart\n\nI go to the gym four times a week on average, so having a supportive pair of sneakers to get me through my workouts is key. Until recently, I\u2019ve relied on my Brooks to be my trusted sidekick, but I started swapping them for this new pair of Avia sneakers that Walmart sent me to test. I\u2019ve tried similarly priced pairs that didn\u2019t perform very well before, so I didn\u2019t have high expectations. However, my feet felt well-cushioned and supported throughout my workouts, which usually involve stair climbing, ab training, weight lifting and Pilates.\n\nI\u2019ve also been testing these sneakers on the walking pad I use during my nine-to-five and easily log 10,000 steps (or more) a day from this and walking outside of my working hours. There was no break-in period, and my feet don\u2019t feel sore while wearing them after walking for hours both inside and outside. Additionally, my feet tend to overpronate, and these shoes have helped keep them from turning inwards and potentially hurting my ankles. They feel secure, but not too snug, and it\u2019s like they were specially crafted for my feet right from the get-go. The sneakers genuinely feel cloud-like.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one who loves these shoes\u2014other Walmart shoppers are glad they found the $25 alternative to expensive styles.

Another supercenter at Hopedale Mall is slated to open later this year. Three supercenters are slated to open in Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray in Alberta by 2027. Additionally, the retailer plans to open its Vaughan Distribution Center this spring.\n\nThe investments announced this week will also support the modernization and expansion of the company\u2019s Canadian supply chain. Walmart Canada also announced Thursday that Canada Cartage has acquired the company\u2019s fleet business. The company declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal.\n\nThe investment comes on the heels of several executive appointments at Walmart Canada, including Venessa Yates as CEO. Yates, who was appointed to the chief executive role last week, was previously senior vice president and general manager of the company\u2019s Walmart+ membership program. She replaces Gonzalo Gebara, who is leaving the company late next month after 25 years for family reasons and to pursue other interests.\n\n\"The Canadian business, with its 100,000 associates and impressive 30-year history, has always been a source of pride,\" Yates said in a statement. \"We're currently in growth mode and I'm excited about our future.\"\n\nAdditionally, Steve Schrobilgen was named Walmart Canada's chief operating officer. His responsibilities include oversight of supply chain and real estate. Schrobilgen\u2019s prior position was senior vice president and business unit leader for Walmart in the Western U.S.\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement also comes as Walmart Canada wraps up a prior 3.5 billion Canadian dollar investment, first announced in 2020. Under that initiative, the company said it updated more than 180 stores, added four stores in Victoria, British Columbia, and Montreal and relocated two stores in Edmonton and Vaughan, Ontario.\n\nAdditionally, the company invested 800 million Canadian dollars to open a fulfillment center and three distribution centers, including the Vaughan location. The company also touted its 200 million Canadian dollar investment last year in pay increases for Walmart Canada\u2019s frontline workers.",

            "content": "At first glance, there's nothing all that similar between Realty Income (O 1.49%) and Walmart (WMT 1.01%). One is a real estate investment trust (REIT), the other a retailer. But there's an important intersection, since the properties on which Realty Income is focused are largely occupied by retailers. In fact, Walmart is one of the REIT's largest grocery store-related tenants. A comparison between these two related companies is worth close consideration for long-term dividend investors.\n\nWalmart vs. Realty Income: The businesses\n\nWalmart is a retailer known for its big box stores. With low prices and a wide selection, it is a huge draw for consumers. In fact, it has been performing particularly well of late. In the third quarter of 2024, revenues rose a solid 5.5%, with adjusted earnings up nearly 14%. Given the uncertainty that has been surrounding many of its retail peers -- Target saw revenues rise just 1.1% and earnings fall nearly 12% in the same quarter -- Walmart is executing at the head of the pack right now.\n\nRealty Income is a landlord, using the net lease approach. Basically, it owns single-tenant properties where the tenant is responsible for most property-level expenses. Although any single property is high-risk since there's only one tenant, across a large portfolio, the risk is pretty low. Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT, with a portfolio of over 15,400 assets. It is also highly diversified, with properties in the U.S. and Europe, along with 27% of its portfolio being outside of the retail sector.\n\nSlow and steady giants\n\nThere's one big takeaway here that investors need to fully wrap their heads around. These two companies are giants in their industries. Neither one is likely to provide huge growth over the long term -- it just requires too much investment to move the needle. Both companies could probably come up with the money needed to make large investments. The real problem is finding the opportunities to put huge amounts of money to work. And while Walmart is doing well right now, that's relative to a fairly easy comparison from the prior year, when adjusted earnings rose just 2%.\n\nThat said, a better way to view the big-picture story here might be in Walmart's dividend, which has increased at an annualized rate of 2.6% over the past decade. Realty Income's dividend growth was roughly similar. Basically, both companies are tortoises. But that's not a bad thing if you are a conservative income investor, since Walmart is a Dividend King and Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for three decades.\n\nBut there's a big difference when it comes to the dividends. Walmart's dividend yield is around 1%, which is even below the miserly 1.2% of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) right now. Realty Income's yield is 5.8%. In fact, Walmart's dividend yield is near the lowest levels of the last decade, while Realty Income's is near the high end of the range over that same span. That suggests that Walmart is expensive right now, while Realty Income might be cheap.\n\nIf you are an income investor, Realty Income will probably be more to your liking. If you care at all about valuation, Walmart will probably be a tough stock to buy. To put a single number on that, its price-to-earnings ratio is a lofty 39x today, versus just 15x for the SPDR S&P Retail ETF. Unless you believe that Walmart is suddenly going to turn into a growth stock, despite the already vast scale of its business, you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nHigher yield, similar dividend growth\n\nCould Walmart's growth kick into high gear on a sustained basis? Sure, but that outcome looks like it has already been priced into the stock. Investors should tread with caution. If you are looking for retail exposure, perhaps it would be worth buying a stock with a similar dividend growth history and higher yield. In other words, Realty Income, which leases properties to Walmart and many other retailers, looks like it will win this match-up for most investors (and particularly for those seeking to generate passive income).",

            "content": "If you've owned Walmart (WMT 1.01%) shares since early 2022, then you're likely thrilled with your results. The retailer's stock more than doubled the S&P 500's return over that time, delivering nearly 100% returns in the three years that ended on Jan. 23, 2025.\n\nThat market-thumping performance didn't just boil down to industry growth, as peers including Target and Kroger returned less than 30% in the period. Only Costco came close to Walmart's stellar returns since early 2022.\n\nIs the chain destined to leave its rivals in the dust again over the next several years, or are the stock's best days behind it? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWalmart's ingredients for success\n\nYou can trace Walmart's great stock performance back to its excellent business trends. Those showed up mainly in market share growth, e-commerce gains, and rising profitability. Let's briefly review each trend to see whether Walmart can extend its positive momentum toward 2027.\n\nOn market share, Walmart has found a way to expand the business even as peers endured a pullback when consumers cut costs in response to high inflation. The most recent quarter is a great example, with comparable-store sales up 5% through late October 2024. Target's comps were flat, and Kroger's gains were just 2%. Walmart's value focus has been a major draw for consumers lately.\n\nBut investors have been especially pleased with Walmart's e-commerce success. That channel crossed $100 billion in annual sales last year and was up 27% last quarter. A thriving e-commerce division is also lifting traffic at stores, since many customers decide to shop in person as they pick up orders. Customer traffic was up a healthy 3% in the U.S. last quarter.\n\nFinally, there's the profit margin, which has been lifted by those rising digital sales, along with higher membership fees. Walmart's operating profit margin is climbing back toward the 5% high that investors saw in 2022.\n\nWhat to watch in February\n\nThe big question heading into Walmart's Feb. 20 earnings report is whether those positive factors kept lifting the business through the critical holiday shopping season. It's likely that they did, given that management raised its fiscal year outlook in mid-November. Investors are looking for Walmart to report net sales growth of around 5% and adjusted operating profit gains of as much as 9.25%.\n\nAchieving those strong results, of industry-leading growth plus expanding profit margin, will be the first step toward Walmart's continued outperformance.\n\nThat said, the stock's pricey valuation could make it harder for investors to see strong returns. You'll have to pay 1.1 times sales for Walmart stock right now, up from 0.75 times sales a few years ago. Other successful retailers like Costco have seen their stock valuations climb to new highs as well, but there's a good chance that the wider industry, if not the entire market, is due for some lackluster returns following the huge rally in the S&P 500 in both 2023 and 2024.\n\nStill, Walmart is a good candidate for many investors' portfolios. The retailer just demonstrated that it can perform well even while many consumers are pulling back on their spending. And its e-commerce unit is finally set to start contributing to the annual earnings pool in 2025 and beyond. While it isn't likely to quickly double in value again, Walmart stock is primed to keep delivering good returns for patient shareholders over the coming years.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWalmart is adding $25,000 in annual stock grants to its compensation package for market managers, the company confirmed to Retail Dive on Friday. The change makes the managers eligible for $100,000 in stock grants annually.\n\nThe company also raised the minimum salary for market managers, who typically oversee about a dozen stores and store managers, from $130,000 to $160,000. The upper end of the pay range remains $260,000. Additionally, these managers may now earn an annual bonus of up to 100% of their salary \u2014 that\u2019s an increase from 90% previously.\n\nWith the recent stock grant and bonus potential adjustments, the total annual compensation package for Walmart\u2019s market managers may now reach $620,000.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWalmart\u2019s increase to market manager salaries is one of several substantial pay changes in the last 12 months that reflect the importance each group has on the company\u2019s overall performance and profitability.\n\nIn the last year, the company introduced a bonus program for full-time and part-time hourly store associates, boosted store manager pay and now, has also increased the compensation packages for market managers. The company said all of its salary investments are part of an ongoing process that began a decade ago.\n\nThe pay changes reflect the importance the roles play in supporting the company\u2019s growth, the company said. The market manager position, \u201cwhich oversees multiple stores \u2014 is key for our business and for serving our customers however they shop,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThis is the latest in a series of investments in hourly and salaried roles across Walmart.\u201d\n\nEach of Walmart\u2019s approximately 4,600 U.S. stores has a store manager. Each market manager, in turn, oversees about a dozen stores and their store managers. Walmart said it has about 440 market managers in the U.S.\n\nWalmart said most of its market manager salaries already fall within the newly announced pay range. The compensation changes all take effect at the start of the company\u2019s 2026 fiscal year. That means the 100% bonus potential will be reflected in March and the potential $100,000 stock grants will be awarded in April, the company said.\n\nThese managers \u201care critical to Walmart. They\u2019re running very big businesses, often serving millions of customers every week,\u201d GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said via email. \u201cWalmart needs good people in these roles to deliver on its ambitions and to drive growth. The fact they\u2019re willing to pay a lot shows the importance of the position and the need to compensate well in what remains a tight job market.\u201d\n\nLast January, Walmart updated its store manager pay and bonus structure. The changes boosted the average store manager salary to $128,000, up from $117,000, and increased annual bonuses to up to 200% of their salary.\n\nWalmart also added $20,000 in stock grants to its Supercenter store manager compensation packages, meaning people in that role could potentially earn over $400,000 annually. Then, in June, the company said full- and part-time hourly store associates were now eligible for bonuses of up to $1,000 per year.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s continued pay investments come as Walmart\u2019s third-quarter consolidated revenue rose 5.5% from a year ago to $169.6 billion, the retailer reported in November. U.S. net sales rose to nearly $115 billion in Q3, up about 5% from the prior year. The company also said its e-commerce sales rose 27% globally and 22% in the U.S. It attributed part of that growth to store-fulfilled pickup and delivery, as well as the company\u2019s third-party marketplace.",

Apple Wallets and Google Wallets can store various payment options as well as things like your digital hotel key, boarding passes and concert tickets.\n\nWalmart, with more than 4,600 locations across the country, is one of the last major retailers to refuse to accept third-party contactless payment options.\n\nBy sticking to its internal mobile payment app, Walmart avoids paying fees for third-party options and can more easily track your purchase history. However, that exclusivity also makes purchases less convenient for customers who use digital apps and wallets as their primary means of payment.\n\nHow to use Walmart Pay\n\nIf you download the Walmart app, you can add payment methods in a wallet within Account Settings, then use them with Walmart Pay. The app allows you to store a variety of payment methods:\n\nCredit and debit cards from most of the major issuers, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover\n\nBank account\n\nWalmart gift cards\n\nElectronic Benefits Transfer\n\nHealthcare benefits cards, like HSA and FSA\n\nPayPal\n\nIf you're in a store, you can use Walmart Pay within the app, and then scan the QR code at checkout to pay for your purchase. When the payment is complete, you'll receive a digital receipt in the app.\n\nAlternative payment options to Walmart Pay\n\nIf you don't want to install the Walmart app on your phone or add your payment info there, you can still make purchases at Walmart. If you're making a purchase in store, you can use credit and debit cards, Walmart gift cards, Electronic Benefits Transfer, HSA and FSA cards, or PayPal (in some locations).\n\nTo use PayPal at the register, you'll need the PayPal app. From the menu, select In-person & QR code to set up in-person payments. Choose \"Show to pay\" and a QR code will be generated, which can be scanned by the cashier to process your payment.\n\nWalmart also accepts PayPal for online purchases. If your Walmart doesn't offer PayPal at the register and you want an extra layer of security protecting your bank account or card number, you can order the item online and pay using your PayPal account.\n\nYou can also still technically use your digital wallet to shop online at Walmart online. You'll just need to enter your credit card number when checking out. In a digital wallet, you can find your card number by clicking on the payment method in the wallet, then going to the menu in the top left corner and clicking on Card Number. You'll see your card number (or virtual card number, if available), expiration date and security code, which you'll need to enter in as payment info on the Walmart.com",

            "content": "Walmart will stock the garden departments of at least 600 U.S. stores with compost made out of food waste collected from its grocery operations.\n\nReCirculate is made by Denali, a 10-year-old organic recycler that has been collecting food waste since July at more than 1,400 Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club locations in 16 markets, including Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Walmart manages 4,700 stores across the U.S.\n\nThe compost will be priced just under $7 per one-cubic-foot bag. It\u2019s Denali\u2019s first retail product to market the use of unsalable food as an ingredient. ReCirculate will be sold initially in eight states where Walmart stores sell high quantities of soil supplements: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Walmart\u2019s purchasing team picked the locations.\n\n7 million tons diverted annually\n\nWalmart, the largest U.S. grocery retailer, has pledged to reduce the operational food waste generated by its stores 50 percent by 2030, compared with a 2016 baseline. So far, it has managed a 12 percent cut, after some recalculations. For example, it turns outdated bread into croutons used for salads or into crostinis. Rotisserie chicken might eventually turn up in salads.\n\nThe retailer is also seeking ways to cut the amount of methane generated by the organic materials it sends to landfills, by processing it in different ways. Walmart diverts 78 percent of all its waste from landfills.\n\nSpoiled produce, expired meats and dairy products, out-of-date bread and beverages, and other foods unsold by grocery retailers contribute to an estimated 4.4 million tons in U.S. food waste annually. At least half of those organic materials wind up in landfills, where they contribute to rising methane emissions. There\u2019s also a clear economic impact: a loss of about $3.6 billion across the industry in unsold inventory.\n\nWalmart is among the seven retail signatories of the U.S. Food Waste Pact, coordinated by nonprofit ReFed and World Wildlife Fund, that requires organizations to set a food waste reduction goal and report regularly on progress. The other retailers are Ahold Delhaize, Aldi, Albertsons, Amazon Fresh, Kroger and Whole Foods.\n\nDenali\u2019s business model\n\nDenali picked up and recycled 7 million tons of food waste in 2023, recycling it into animal feed, biodiesel, compost, mulch and soils. Its customers include stadiums, hotels, food production facilities and retailers. The company estimates those collection and mitigation efforts represent the equivalent of taking 100,000 gas-powered cars off the road for a year.\n\nWalmart is the first retailer to use Denali\u2019s \u201cdepackaging\u201d technology, Zero De-Pack, which makes it simpler for stores to separate produce and other food from cardboard boxes, metal cans, plastic containers and wrappers. The two have been collaborating for two years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see unique partnerships at the food recycling level,\u201d said Jackie Suggitt, vice president of business initiatives and community engagement at ReFed. Many grocers are using technology and other best practices to prevent waste in the first place, but we\u2019re always going to have food that will require attention at the end of its life, she said.\n\nDenali provides bins with a capacity of three cubic yards, where retailers deposit food waste on a daily basis. Denali\u2019s fleet of 1,300 trucks empty them on a weekly basis or when the bins are full. The depackaging equipment handles the separation automatically at one of its facilities.\n\nThe compost being sold in Walmart\u2019s stores will contain organic matter collected from all of Denali\u2019s customers, not just Walmart. Denali collects \u201cfrom thousands of retail locations, so it\u2019s difficult to say that a specific food waste item went into a bag that originated from a specific retailer,\u201d said Eric Speiser, chief revenue officer.\n\nDenali is gathering data to create a life-cycle analysis of the emissions associated with processing and transporting ReCirculate to retailers, compared with similar products.\n\nGenerally speaking, turning organic matter into compost is far less-intensive than allowing it to decay in landfills, Suggitt said. \u201cIt comes down to how far it\u2019s being transported, is it replacing fertilizer, is it being used?\u201d she said.\n\nDenali works with a network of two dozen compost facilities and also sells compost in bulk to garden and nursery outlets, builders, golf courses and landscapers.\n\nDenali\u2019s other products, such as animal feed, are custom-blended for farmers, ranchers and aquaculture operations, Speiser said. Its biodiesel and lubricants are sold to automotive companies.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated Feb. 3, 2025, to include a comment from Denali.\n\n[Gain insights to move beyond incremental action and accelerate the shift to a circular economy at Circularity, April 29-May 1, Denver, CO.]",

He zooms in on an 18-count carton with a jaw-dropping price tag.\n\n\u201cThis is an 18 count of eggs for 12 freaking dollars. Damn, bruh,\u201d he said. Then, panning over to a larger pack, he adds, \u201c60 eggs, 36 bucks. Yeah. So we got plenty of eggs, just bring your credit card.\u201d\n\nThe video has clearly struck a nerve. As of this writing, it has racked up 475,000 views, 13,000 likes and over 3,000 comments.\n\nSome viewers chimed in to say egg prices in their area weren\u2019t nearly as high.\n\n\u201cI just paid $4.99 for a dozen eggs in my grocery store,\u201d one user wrote. Another added, \u201cTrader Joes in Ca has them for $2.99 a dozen.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, lamented that sky-high prices had made eggs a luxury \u2014 something they\u2019ve had to cut back on before.\n\n\u201cI survived the last time without eggs. I\u2019ll survive this time too,\u201d reads one of the top comments.\n\nBut what caused the spike?\n\nWhy are eggs so expensive?\n\nEgg prices fluctuate by store and location, but they have been climbing steadily. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average price of a dozen Grade A large eggs in the U.S. was $4.146 in December 2024, up from $2.507 in December 2023 \u2014 a staggering 65% increase in just a year.\n\nWholesale prices for graded loose eggs have also surged. A Jan. 17 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report highlighted that concerns over ongoing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have \u201cinfused caution\u201d into the market.\n\nThe bird flu outbreak has impacted supply. A more recent Jan. 24 USDA report noted, \u201cOutbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial table egg layer flocks that resulted in the depopulation of 13.2 million birds in December 2024 continue into the opening weeks of 2025.\u201d",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWalmart is adding $25,000 in annual stock grants to its compensation package for market managers, the company confirmed to Retail Dive on Friday. The change makes the managers eligible for $100,000 in stock grants annually.\n\nThe company also raised the minimum salary for market managers, who typically oversee about a dozen stores and store managers, from $130,000 to $160,000. The upper end of the pay range remains $260,000. Additionally, these managers may now earn an annual bonus of up to 100% of their salary \u2014 that\u2019s an increase from 90% previously.\n\nWith the recent stock grant and bonus potential adjustments, the total annual compensation package for Walmart\u2019s market managers may now reach $620,000.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWalmart\u2019s increase to market manager salaries is one of several substantial pay changes in the last 12 months that reflect the importance each group has on the company\u2019s overall performance and profitability.\n\nIn the last year, the company introduced a bonus program for full-time and part-time hourly store associates, boosted store manager pay and now, has also increased the compensation packages for market managers. The company said all of its salary investments are part of an ongoing process that began a decade ago.\n\nThe pay changes reflect the importance the roles play in supporting the company\u2019s growth, the company said. The market manager position, \u201cwhich oversees multiple stores \u2014 is key for our business and for serving our customers however they shop,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThis is the latest in a series of investments in hourly and salaried roles across Walmart.\u201d\n\nEach of Walmart\u2019s approximately 4,600 U.S. stores has a store manager. Each market manager, in turn, oversees about a dozen stores and their store managers. Walmart said it has about 440 market managers in the U.S.\n\nWalmart said most of its market manager salaries already fall within the newly announced pay range. The compensation changes all take effect at the start of the company\u2019s 2026 fiscal year. That means the 100% bonus potential will be reflected in March and the potential $100,000 stock grants will be awarded in April, the company said.\n\nThese managers \u201care critical to Walmart. They\u2019re running very big businesses, often serving millions of customers every week,\u201d GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said via email. \u201cWalmart needs good people in these roles to deliver on its ambitions and to drive growth. The fact they\u2019re willing to pay a lot shows the importance of the position and the need to compensate well in what remains a tight job market.\u201d\n\nLast January, Walmart updated its store manager pay and bonus structure. The changes boosted the average store manager salary to $128,000, up from $117,000, and increased annual bonuses to up to 200% of their salary.\n\nWalmart also added $20,000 in stock grants to its Supercenter store manager compensation packages, meaning people in that role could potentially earn over $400,000 annually. Then, in June, the company said full and part-time hourly store associates were now eligible for bonuses of up to $1,000 per year.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s continued pay investments come as Walmart\u2019s third-quarter consolidated revenue rose 5.5% from a year ago to $169.6 billion, the retailer reported in November. U.S. net sales rose to nearly $115 billion in Q3, up about 5% from the prior year. The company also said its e-commerce sales rose 27% globally and 22% in the U.S. It attributed part of that growth to store-fulfilled pickup and delivery, as well as the company\u2019s third-party marketplace.",

            "content": "Shares of retail giant Walmart (WMT 1.01%) were up a whopping 72% in 2024. To put the magnitude of this move in perspective, this was the best year for Walmart stock since 1998 -- you read that right. And its 72% return handily outperformed the S&P 500's otherwise stellar gain of 23%.\n\nIt's been 25 years since Walmart's shareholders had this good of a time. And that statement should have investors asking why.\n\nI believe there's an undeniable relationship between Walmart's stock price and its surging operating income. Since the start of 2023, operating income has dramatically improved, as the chart below shows.\n\nWhat's causing this? In the earnings call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of 2024, CEO Doug McMillon had this to say:\n\nGlobally, we drove strong growth in e-commerce, up 27%. Advertising grew 28%, and membership income was up 22%. This helped us grow profits faster than sales.\n\nMcMillon says that Walmart's profits are surging because of growth in e-commerce, advertising, and membership income. These (related) things are the key to understanding the recently skyrocketing stock price and the key to understanding whether the good times for investors can continue.\n\nHow are these three things helping Walmart?\n\nManagement launched its membership program Walmart+ in 2020, and it has seen tremendous growth since. According to financial media outlet PYMNTS, Walmart+ already had over 60 million subscribers in September 2022. And according to the company, it's continued on a double-digit growth rate since then. Therefore, it wouldn't be surprising if it's already knocking on the door of 100 million subscribers.\n\nIf people buy online and pick up at the store, the company counts it toward its e-commerce sales. Walmart+ subscribers have an incentive to use this service or to have items delivered to their homes. In other words, e-commerce growth has been boosted by growth in the membership program.\n\nGetting more people transacting with Walmart digitally has been a boom for the company. The retailer opens up its e-commerce platform to third-party sellers, just like rival Amazon. Moreover, it's able to generate advertising revenue unlike ever before.\n\nIn summary, Walmart is growing its digital business. People are paying membership fees, third-party merchants pay a cut of their own online sales, and advertisers pay to get in front of the company's customers. This digital growth is higher-margin and is consequently driving rapid growth for operating income, lifting the stock price to its biggest gain since 1998.\n\nCan these things keep helping Walmart?\n\nGiven its incredible performance in 2024, it would be tempting to assume that Walmart stock is now overvalued. But that assumption would be premature. Looking at the 10-year chart, the shares have averaged a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28, which is the P/E valuation for the S&P 500 right now, according to YCharts.\n\nAs the chart below shows, Walmart stock is more expensive than its own average or the average for the S&P 500. But it's also enjoying better-than-average profit growth right now, which justifies a higher valuation.\n\nIn light of this, I'd say that Walmart's valuation, though higher than usual, isn't necessarily a concern. The bigger question is whether profit growth will continue to outpace revenue growth in 2025 and beyond.\n\nI believe that this will indeed continue for the next year, at least. Investors should consider that the catalysts for 2024 -- e-commerce, advertising, and membership income -- are still growing at a strong pace.\n\nCircling back to McMillon, third-quarter revenue for advertising, e-commerce, and membership income were all up more than 20%. Growth rates such as this usually don't abruptly hit a wall. Rather, if there's a slowdown, growth tends to taper off gradually.\n\nBecause of this, it's reasonable to expect at least an ongoing double-digit growth rate in the three aforementioned areas, which will keep boosting profits. And this is assuming its digital growth has already peaked.\n\nBut keep in mind that the company is still early in its digital journey. Therefore, it's possible that growth in some of these areas could actually hold steady, if not accelerate further.\n\nTo be clear, I don't think that Walmart will come close to posting another 72% gain in 2025. That said, growth in the digital component of its business is strong, and that will be positive for profits in 2025. For this reason, I believe the stock could indeed outperform the S&P 500 again in 2025.",

We spoke with an interior designer to learn how to maximize a small living space on a budget\u2014and her picks start at just $10.\n\nBrittney Morgan, owner and designer of Brittney Quinn Interiors, is a city dweller\u2014so if anyone knows how to elevate a small apartment, it\u2019s her.

Morgan suggests cloaking those unsightly necessities underneath a console table. \u201cSkirted vanities and cabinets with curtains have made a comeback recently,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cWhile they look cute, they can also help you add storage to spaces that would otherwise be open.\u201d This style\u2019s covered sides make it easy to attach and hide a tension rod with short curtains, which you can open and close to hide the clutter inside.\n\nBut the small space storage solutions don\u2019t end there.

Another shopper said when they wear it outside it keeps them warm, but they also like to wear it inside to lounge around and be comfortable in.\n\nThe cozy knit cardigan comes in sizes ranging from XS to 3XL in all colors, but it is already selling out in certain designs.

Do you feel like anything in your supermarket cart has gotten cheaper?\n\nOverall, inflation has cooled for about two years in the United States. That means prices, generally, have been rising less. Some have even declined. But what does that look like when you go shopping?\n\nSince 2018, NPR has tracked prices at the Walmart here. It's a bustling suburban superstore \u2014 what you think of when you think of Walmart. On the most recent visit, in December, I had a new goal: to see, literally, how many of the 96 items on my list had gotten cheaper over the past year. To do this, I would buy everything on the list that has declined in price.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nIn the produce aisle, I grab the first item: a bag of red seedless grapes. The grapes have changed brands over time and dropped in price by 20%. Into my cart they go, soon followed by bananas from Guatemala and garlic from Peru, as well as an American-grown white onion and a sweet potato of unlisted origin.\n\nI start feeling optimistic.\n\nWalmart's CEO has touted his chain's push to lower prices on 6,000 items, half of which are groceries. The largest U.S. retailer has the scale to extract the best deals from suppliers. And it has negotiated temporary price rollbacks with many brands. That includes Ocean Spray, whose big jug of cranberry juice lands in my cart because its price declined 12% over a year.\n\n\n\nNot quite so fast\n\nBut historically, prices rarely drop in the long run. It's more typical for them to rise or stay flat, while our wages rise also and help us catch up. In the meantime, our brains tend to focus on the price hikes. And I still spot them in most aisles of this superstore.\n\nOver and over, I pick up an item just to return it to the shelf because of its higher cost: a bag of Lay's potato chips, a jar of Pace salsa.\n\ntoggle caption Alina Selyukh/NPR\n\nWhen asked about their price increases, Lay's and Pace didn't comment. Walmart, in a statement, said it was \"committed to providing an Every Day Low Price experience \u2026 with the goal of having the lowest price on a basket of goods over time.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOther big brands sent statements to NPR pointing to their own higher costs: fertilizer, packaging, shipping, wages. Jif cited pricier peanuts; Yoplait, pricier milk for its yogurt. The global cocoa shortage has Lindt and Hershey raising prices. Avian flu has hiked the cost of eggs.\n\n\n\nA silver lining, sort of\n\nThrough most of the aisles, I find myself muttering the same phrase: \"Not cheaper.\" Or: \"Same price.\"\n\nSpoiler alert: I find that exactly half the items on my list cost the same as they did a year ago. This doesn't feel like good news, though it can be; prices staying stable is a notable relief from the constant climb of recent years.\n\nAnd then, there are price changes so small that you blink and you miss them. A bottle of Tropicana orange juice appears to cost the same as a year ago, but a closer inspection reveals the bottle is smaller by 6 ounces, in a classic case of shrinkflation.\n\nTropicana didn't comment. But shrinkflation is why I look at the price per unit: focusing on the cost of an ounce of juice in that bottle, rather than the total price tag.\n\nAt one point, this gets me into a dilemma, holding a roll of Reynolds Wrap nonstick aluminum foil.\n\nThe foil is cheaper by 63 cents. But per square foot, the savings comes out to less than a cent. Does it even count? I seek help from a fellow shopper.\n\n\"I don't think so, but you know, it may add up after so many,\" says Pat Perkins, shopping for some bread and coffee. \"We better take what we can get nowadays. Every little bit adds up.\"\n\ntoggle caption Alina Selyukh/NPR\n\nThis approach means more things for my shopping cart. In go bags of flour and sugar, down by only a cent or two per pound, plus Russet potatoes and honey.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nFrom the seafood freezer, I grab a 2-pound bag of pink salmon, cheaper by 25% than it was a year earlier. In the meat section, I score boneless pork chops, down by 23%. The first and only item not related to food to go into my shopping cart is a yoga mat, at a 19% price decrease from a year before.\n\nAt checkout, it's time to tally up the loot: I'm walking out of this Walmart with 21 items. That means just over a fifth of my shopping list got cheaper over the course of the year.\n\nNo orange juice, milk or eggs, but I've got bagels, fruit and oatmeal for breakfast. And for dinner, I'm having beans, potatoes and an odd surf-and-turf of salmon and pork \u2014 to be roasted on foil.\n\nLoading...\n\nGraphics by Juweek Adolphe/NPR",

            "content": "Several economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nWe recently published a list of 11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.

(WMT) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA manager standing in a hypermarket, pointing out items available for wholesale.\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail, wholesale, and other units worldwide. There are several compelling factors that make this company a strong investment. Firstly, the report for the third quarter of 2024 shows the company\u2019s strong performance in the US market and its ability to maintain growth. For instance, Walmart US had net sales of $441.8 billion, representing 69% of consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $420.6 billion and $393.2 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders, with total dividend payments of $6.1 billion in fiscal 2024, $6.1 billion in fiscal 2023, and $6.2 billion in fiscal 2022. Walmart has approved an increase in the fiscal 2025 annual dividend to $0.83 per share, up from $0.76 in fiscal 2024. Moreover, the expanded partnership of Walmart with Symbiotic aims to develop an advanced AI-enabled robotics solution aimed at enhancing online pickup and delivery options. The firm has invested $520 million towards this project.\n\nOverall, WMT ranks 7th on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now.

EXPANDED PRODUCT OFFERINGS\n\nWalmart is taking strides to level up its business model, including attracting a new customer base - affluent shoppers.\n\nOne of the ways the company is doing this is by expanding its product offerings, especially in the e-commerce space.\n\nWalmart now sells premium items such as Apple products and Bose headphones, which Rainey said \"are sought after by more affluent customers.\"\n\nHe emphasized that Walmart was not \"alienating our more traditional customer cohorts\" even in the face of expanding its traditional assortment.\n\n\"Today's Walmart is very different than the Walmart of several years ago,\" Rainey told Fox Business, noting that changes such as its premium offerings have increased its customer base of higher-income households.\n\nIn its latest fiscal quarter, Walmart shared that households making more than $100,000 yearly accounted for 75% of its share gains.\n\n2. ENHANCED IN-STORE EXPERIENCE\n\nAnother significant change Walmart shoppers can expect throughout the year is the construction of new modernized stores and the remodeling of others.\n\nWalmart rolling out major change to over 2000 stores with bosses saying the update will improve shopper's experience\n\nIn an effort to elevate its in-store experience, the company remodeled nearly 700 stores each year over the past three years and intends to upgrade more this year.\n\n\"When you walk into one of these remodeled stores, it's a very, very different experience from what you've thought about historically,\" said Rainey.\n\nNew and revamped Walmart stores boast the company's new concept, including upgraded layouts, larger product selection, and new tech to assist staff with customer support.\n\nThe modernized locations also feature refreshed signs, paint, shopping carts, and a new checkout design.\n\nWhen you walk into one of these remodeled stores, it's a very, very different experience from what you've thought about historically.\" John David Rainey\n\nThe stores also house interactive displays and huge merchandise on display to allow consumers a better look at products.\n\n3. INCREASED BRAND COLLABS\n\nAnother big change Walmart has made to modernize its image, reach new audiences, and create exclusive products, is by increasing its brand collaborations.\n\nThe company has partnered with many social media influencers, designers, and other brands in a strategic effort to appeal to younger shoppers.\n\nIt launched Walmart Creator in 2022, an affiliate program that connects influencers directly with its distribution network.\n\nWhite, Walmart's CMO, emphasized the retailer's dedication to deepening relationships with creators during the Forbes Creator Upfronts event last fall.\n\nOne of Walmart's latest partnerships is with Rebag, an online resale platform, to sell pre-owned designer bags, watches, and fine jewelry on its Marketplace platform.\n\nConsumers could purchase luxury products from brands including Herm\u00e8s, Goyard, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Dior from January 16.\n\n4. BRAND REFRESH\n\nThe last major initiative Walmart has taken on is refreshing its brand through a new logo.\n\nThe company changed its iconic logo for the first time in 17 year in an effort to modernize its digital footprint and appeal to more affluent shoppers.\n\nThe newly redone logo features a darker and brighter blue background, thicker lettering on \"Walmart,\" and rounder stems in its yellow spark graphic.\n\n4 Walmart changed its logo for first time in 17 years to modernize its brand Credit: Walmart\n\nThe change is a reflection of Walmart's evolution since 2008, when the company last updated its logo.\n\n\"I wouldn't call this a rebrand, but really a refresh to reflect who we are today,\" Walmart's CMO told Fortune.\n\n\"The Walmart of today is very different than the Walmart of 2008, the last time we made a change in the brand identity. We are more modern, we are more digital.\n\n\"The changes are meaningful in terms of giving a little bit more life and energy to the spark, making it richer and fuller and giving it more depth,\" White added.\n\nThe Walmart of today is very different than the Walmart of 2008, the last time we made a change in the brand identity. We are more modern, we are more digital.\" William White\n\nWalmart shoppers will begin to notice the updated logo in-store, on the app, and on its website beginning this month.\n\nWalmart operates over 4,600 US locations, employing around 1.6 million workers.\n\nCheck out these other retail changes The U.S. Sun has reported on.\n\nCostco officially axed a popular section in all its locations as members fume \"Costco has made a major mistake.\"\n\nPlus, Best Buy has taken on Amazon with its new \"marketplace\" rolling out this year \u2013 but shoppers say the chain is \"too late.\"",

            "content": "The Federal Trade Commission sued PepsiCo last Friday, alleging that it has engaged in illegal price discrimination by giving unfair price advantages to one large retailer at the expense of other vendors and consumers.\n\nThe benefiting customer wasn\u2019t named in an FTC statement about the lawsuit, but a source familiar with the case, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss it, said the retailer was Walmart.\n\nPepsiCo said the lawsuit \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law\u201d and misunderstands the way consumer product companies help retailers provide lower prices.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo strongly disputes the FTC\u2019s allegations and the partisan manner in which the suit was filed. We will vigorously present our case in court,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe FTC said PepsiCo\u2019s practices included making promotional payments to Walmart but not to large grocery chains or independent convenience stores. The FTC said that allowed Walmart to lower its prices but forces Americans to pay inflated prices for PepsiCo products unless they shop at Walmart.\n\n\u201cWhen firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in the statement. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s action will help ensure all grocers and other businesses \u2014 no matter the size \u2014 can get a fair shake and compete on the merits of their skill, efficiency, and talent.\u201d\n\nWalmart said Friday it had \u201cnothing to add at this time.\u201d PepsiCo said its practices \u201care in line with industry norms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not favor certain customers by offering discounts or promotional support to some customers and not others,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe FTC sued PepsiCo under the rarely enforced 1936 Robinson-Patman Act. The FTC said the act prohibits companies from using promotional incentive payments to favor large customers over smaller ones.\n\nIt was the second time in a little more than a month that the FTC has cited the Robinson-Patman Act in a lawsuit. In December, the commission sued Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits, a large U.S. distributor, saying it illegally discriminated against small and independent businesses by giving discounts and rebates to larger stores.\n\nIn the waning days of the Biden administration, the FTC was busy issuing consumer refunds, taking enforcement actions against companies the agency accused of deceptive practices, and finalizing rules it said were needed to make the marketplace fairer.\n\nThe FTC voted 3-2 to authorize staff to file a lawsuit for a permanent injunction against PepsiCo in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was one of the two dissenting votes.\n\nThe other commissioner voting against the lawsuit, Melissa Holyoak, wrote in her dissent that the case against PepsiCo was \u201cthe worst case I have seen in my time at the commission.\u201d Holyoak said the majority of commissioners rushed the case out the door before they had enough evidence to support the allegations.\n\n\u201cPepsi\u2019s promotions to the retailer are not disguised discriminatory discounts but rather ordinary price concessions,\u201d Holyoak wrote.\n\nPepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies. Pepsi was first invented in 1893 as \u201cBrad\u2019s Drink\u201d by Caleb Bradham, who sold the drink at his drugstore in New Bern. It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, \u201cPepsi\u201d because it was advertised to relieve dyspepsia (indigestion) and \u201cCola\u201d referring to the cola flavor. PepsiCo now makes Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snack foods like Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos and Fritos. It also makes Quaker Oats, breakfast cereals and granola bars.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s prices have been subject to some scrutiny since the pandemic. In 2022, for example, the company acknowledged shrinking its Gatorade bottles from 32 ounces to 28 ounces, but it didn\u2019t respond when asked why it charged more for the 28-ounce bottles.\n\nIn October, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania sent letters to PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and General Mills accusing them of price gouging through shrinking package sizes.\n\nPepsiCo has said its price increases were necessary because of the rising cost of ingredients, shipping, packaging and labor. But over the summer, the company said consumers were pulling back on snack and drink purchases or shifting to cheaper store brands.\n\nPepsiCo responded by trying to make Lay\u2019s more affordable through a mix of product promotions, more chips per bag and value packs. Similar promotions were planned for Doritos and Tostitos.",

            "content": "Walmart (WMT 1.01%) surged 71.9% in 2024, making it the second-best-performing component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average behind Nvidia. Investors may be wondering if Walmart can carry the momentum forward in 2025.\n\nWalmart's investment thesis has evolved from a stodgy dividend-paying value stock to a high-octane growth stock. With over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, Walmart is also a Dividend King that sports a coveted combo of passive income potential and outsized market gains -- but only if it can sustain its momentum.\n\nHere's a look at the key elements of Walmart's success, and whether the stock is worth buying now.\n\nWalmart's banner year\n\nOver the last five years, retailers have dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges, inflationary pressures, weakening consumer demand, and more. But through it all, Walmart made the necessary investments to improve its product and services offerings, convey value, and offer convenience.\n\nIn recent years, Walmart's capital expenditures have exploded higher. It has poured money into new stores, existing store renovations, e-commerce, Walmart+ subscription-based home delivery, and even artificial intelligence. Those investments are paying off.\n\nInflation may lead people to pull back on big-ticket spending, but they still need to get groceries and household goods from somewhere. And many will still buy discretionary goods, just at lower prices.\n\nWalmart essentially became the confluence of low-income and higher-income consumers -- of consumer staples and discretionary spending. Walmart has been taking market share from other discount retailers and holding its own even while margins plummeted at companies like Target. Walmart's value proposition resonated with consumers, which is why it was able to hit an all-time high while Dollar General and Dollar Tree hit five-year lows. Similarly, Walmart's operating margins rapidly rebounded, whereas Target is struggling to unlock its next growth phase.\n\nWalmart emerged from a period of stagnating growth and declining margins and achieved record revenue and profits.\n\nWalmart's results are impressive in their own right. But the fact that they came when so many other discount retailers were struggling lit a fire under the stock price. There's also reason to think the growth could continue.\n\nAnalyst consensus estimates call for $2.48 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share (EPS) and $2.76 in fiscal 2026 EPS. Walmart is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 20. For context, Walmart earned $1.91 in fiscal 2024 diluted EPS -- a record high.\n\nWalmart earned $1.73 in fiscal 2020 EPS (adjusted for its 3-for-1 stock split), which was the year ended Jan. 31, 2020, before the pandemic. So compared to that period, Walmart's earnings growth is nothing short of excellent. The problem is that investors have already taken notice, given the massive gain in 2024.\n\nWalmart stock isn't a good value\n\nWalmart is an excellent example of why a phenomenal business can be a poor investment opportunity. The stock was arguably undervalued heading into 2024. But now, Walmart is priced to perfection.\n\nEven if it achieves fiscal 2026 earnings estimates of $2.76 per share, it would still have a 33.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on the current stock price of around $92 per share. That's a sky-high valuation for a company expected to grow earnings by 11.3%.\n\nFor Walmart to reach a $1 trillion market cap, its stock price would have to be around $124.50 per share. If you think Walmart is a little overvalued right now and a 35 P/E ratio is more reasonable, it would have to earn $3.56 in EPS to reach a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nAt a 30 P/E ratio, EPS would have to be $4.15. And at a 25 P/E ratio, EPS would have to be $4.98.\n\nFor context, Walmart's five-year median P/E is 30.5, and its 10-year median P/E is 26.8.\n\nHere's a look at Walmart's projected EPS, assuming 10% annual earnings growth after fiscal 2026, and what the stock price would be based on different P/E multiples.\n\nMetric Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2026 Fiscal 2027 Fiscal 2028 Fiscal 2029 Fiscal 2030 Fiscal 2031 Fiscal 2032 Projected EPS (10% Annual Growth After Fiscal 2026) $2.48 $2.76 $3.04 $3.34 $3.67 $4.04 $4.45 $4.89 Stock Price at 25 P/E $62.00 $69.00 $76.00 $83.50 $91.75 $101.00 $111.25 $122.25 Stock Price at 30 P/E $74.40 $82.80 $91.20 $100.20 $110.10 $121.20 $133.50 $146.70 Stock Price at 35 P/E $86.80 $96.60 $106.40 $116.90 $128.45 $141.40 $155.75 $171.15\n\nBased on a 25 P/E and assuming the 10% earnings growth rate, it would take Walmart over seven years to reach a $1 trillion market cap, over five years based on a 30 P/E, and over three years based on a lofty 35 P/E.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Walmart is an expensive stock. It's no longer a compelling passive income source, either.\n\nWalmart is a Dividend King with 51 consecutive years of increasing its payout. But because the stock price gained so much in a short period, Walmart only yields 0.9% -- which is less than the 1.2% yield of the S&P 500.\n\nWhen Walmart releases its fiscal 2025 earnings next month, investors should expect another sizable dividend raise, as Walmart did last year. But it would take several years of massive dividend raises (or for Walmart's stock price to fall) for Walmart to become a viable income stock again.\n\nBetter buys now\n\nWalmart's valuation is stretched too thin for it to reach a $1 trillion market cap in 2025, or in the next couple of years, for that matter. However, its market cap is roughly double that of the second-largest Dividend King, Procter & Gamble. So it will probably become the first Dividend King to reach the $1 trillion milestone, just not this year.\n\nInvestors looking for passive income should turn to other high-yield dividend stocks at cheaper valuations.\n\nInvestors looking for a combination of growing dividends and earnings growth may want to consider companies like Broadcom, Visa, Salesforce, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, which I expect will all boost their payouts by 10% or more in 2025.\n\nWalmart is a great company. But the valuation is way too expensive, the yield is too low, and the growth rate isn't high enough to make it worth buying now -- unless you believe the company will rapidly accelerate its earnings growth, or are simply comfortable paying a premium price for a quality company.",

            "content": "Amazon (AMZN) took aim at Walmart (WMT) more than two decades ago with Jeff Bezos' vision: transforming the online bookseller into a globe-spanning \"everything store.\" Coming off a big year for the tech giant and Amazon stock, 2025 could be the year Amazon supplants Walmart for the title of world's largest company by revenue.\n\nIt's a complicated battle since the companies aren't perfectly comparable. Amazon has a fast-growing cloud computing arm while Walmart has the world's largest footprint of physical stores. Still, Walmart has topped lists of largest companies by revenue, such as the Fortune 500, every year since 2014. But Amazon has been catching up to the retail behemoth. Analysts project the two firms will finish neck-and-neck for 2025.\n\nStill, that doesn't mean Amazon is on its way to vanquishing Walmart as a threat. In fact, Walmart stock outperformed Amazon's last year. Even as new challengers like Temu are capturing attention, analysts say Walmart is stepping up its challenge to Amazon's e-commerce dominance.\n\n\"Walmart is significantly growing their e-commerce business while they're also significantly investing in their e-commerce business,\" CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram, who covers both Amazon and Walmart, told Investor's Business Daily. \"Really, Walmart over the last several years has been able to copy from Amazon's playbook.\"\n\nAmazon Stock: Revenue Battle Vs. Walmart\n\nWalmart will likely keep the crown for largest company by revenue for 2024. For Walmart's January-ending fiscal year, analysts polled by FactSet project that Walmart's sales will grow 5% to $680 billion. Amazon's sales for its December-ended fiscal year are projected to grow 11% to $637.9 billion.\n\nWalmart still sells significantly more goods than Amazon. The National Retail Federation Top 100 retailers list estimates that Walmart accounts for $635 billion in global retail sales compared to Amazon's $360 billion as of 2023, the most recent data.\n\nOf course, Amazon has another $100 billion annual business in cloud computing through Amazon Web Services, along with a fast-growing digital advertising business that has emerged as a rival to giants like Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META)\n\nThat's why the revenue winner for 2025 looks like a toss-up, based on analyst projections. Walmart is projected for $708.8 billion in revenue for the 12 months ended January 2026, according to FactSet, compared to Amazon's $707 billion projected sales for calendar year 2025.\n\nAmazon could soon surpass Walmart on a quarterly basis for the first time. Amazon's projected $187.3 billion in December quarter revenue could come in ahead of Walmart $179.8 billion in projected sales for its January-ending Q4.\n\nWhat Revenue Crown Means For Amazon Stock\n\nIn fact, it may be a matter of when, not if, Amazon surpasses Walmart, Sundaram said. But Amazon stock is unlikely to move significantly based on whether it surpasses Walmart for total revenue.\n\n\"For Amazon, yeah the retail business is important, e-commerce is their main source of revenue,\" Sundaram told IBD. \"But the main source of their profits is their AWS business. And investors really pay more attention to AWS.\"\n\nStill, the battle is drawing attention as Walmart has upped its challenge to Amazon's e-commerce dominance. Walmart's annual global e-commerce sales surpassed $100 billion in 2023 and are growing fast. E-commerce revenue grew 28% year over year for Walmart's most recent October-ended third quarter. However, e-commerce is still not a profitable business for Walmart.\n\nAmazon captured 42% of U.S. e-commerce spending in 2024 compared to Walmart's 9.6%, according to estimates from BofA Global Research. But Walmart e-commerce market share increased by 1.2% from a year earlier, faster than Amazon's 0.8% increase in market share.\n\nAmazon Stock 45% Gain Vs Walmart 72% Gain\n\nWalmart shares gained 72% in 2024, ranking 20th among top-performers in the S&P 500. Amazon stock gained 45%. Amazon has a market cap above $2 trillion, compared to roughly $760 billion for Walmart.\n\nWalmart refocused its e-commerce business over several years by expanding its third-party seller marketplace and selling advertising on its platform. The company also launched its answer to the $139-per-year Amazon Prime membership in 2020, called Walmart+. For $98 per year, the membership include free delivery from local Walmart locations, free shipping on other items and other benefits.\n\nRick Watson, chief executive of RMW Commerce Consulting, said Amazon's Prime subscription provides the company with \"one of the most defensible moats in North America.\"\n\nAn estimated 194 million Americans had an Amazon Prime membership as of December, according to estimates by the research firm CIRP.\n\nWalmart+, meanwhile, is believed by analysts to be far smaller.\n\nBut Walmart has made the right moves to make its subscription offering more compelling, Watson said, including by expanding online inventory through third-party sellers.\n\n\"Amazon is still the king,\" Watson told IBD. \"Walmart, it seems, has found a good formula with the same-day services combined with grocery and increasing selection online. So they're on a really good growth trajectory.\"\n\nOther retailers, such as Target (TGT), are still looking for the right loyalty formula in membership offerings, Watson added.\n\nAmazon Is Retail Advertising King\n\nA key part of Amazon's recent growth and improved retail margins is its advertising business. Amazon is projected to bring in $56.3 billion in advertising revenue for 2024, according to FactSet.\n\nThe tech giant pioneered and dominates the retail media search advertising category. Research firm eMarketer projects that 80% of retail media search revenue went to Amazon last year.\n\nBut Walmart's efforts are growing quickly. eMarketer forecast in June that Walmart would account for 40% of \"non-Amazon retail media search ad dollars\" in 2024 \u2014 top among all competitors. Bernstein analysts believe Walmart has room to grow its ad revenue.\n\n\"Compared to Amazon's ad revenue at (more than) 7% of gross merchandise value, Walmart's U.S. ad revenue is only at a low-single-digital percentage of GMV today,\" wrote Bernstein analyst Zhihan Ma in a recent client note. \"We believe that Walmart can play catch-up by growing its marketplace, but likely won't achieve Amazon's level as Walmart strikes a balance between maintaining its e-grocery stronghold and growing the more profitable third-party business.\"\n\nWalmart's Advantage Over Amazon?\n\nThere is one e-commerce sector where Walmart is the clear leader: groceries. Even with its purchase of Whole Foods eight years ago, Amazon has struggled to match Walmart's scale for food and other essentials.\n\nWalmart captured the highest percentage of U.S. online grocery sales in 2024 at 27%, according to eMarketer projections. Amazon is projected at 18.5% of sales, by the same projections.\n\nAmazon is adjusting its strategy. Last year, it launched a new grocery subscription option and took efforts to streamline the supply chain and customer interface for its Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh and third-party grocer offerings.\n\nIn a letter to shareholder last year, Chief Executive Andy Jassy highlighted grocery alongside generative AI, Prime Video and health care as potential growth areas for Amazon.\n\nThere are reasons it remains a priority.\n\n\"If you can attract a customer to come into your website or your store to buy groceries, it's so much easier to sell them other things, whether a T-shirt, furniture, whatever it is,\" Sundaram told IBD. \"That's what Amazon really wanted to do by getting more competitive in the grocery space. But they've struggled. \"\n\nThat means, in this case, Amazon is still hoping to be the disrupter. Sundaram said he expects Amazon will pursue more \"investment in that area, to try to better compete with the giants like Walmart.\"\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nGet Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report | How To Invest\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis\n\nWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nSome top Walmart managers will now make as much as $620,000 annually as part of a broader pay raise from America\u2019s biggest retail chain.\n\nThe people receiving these pay raises are market managers who oversee around a dozen stores. Their total pay, including bonuses and stock awards, will increase from $320,000 to $420,000 on the low end and from $570,000 to $620,000 on the high end, according to a Walmart spokesperson. The Wall Street Journal first reported the changes.\n\nStarting base pay for the market manager position is increasing nearly 25% to $160,000, with increases to the stock grants and bonuses making up the rest.\n\nThe Walmart spokesperson told CNN in a statement that the market manager role \u201cis key for our business and for serving our customers however they shop.\u201d\n\nWalmart employs more than 400 market managers who oversee around a combined 4,600 stores in the United States. The midlevel-management jobs involve long hours and traveling among the stores to check on inventory, supervise staff and deal with customer feedback, according to a job description.\n\nThe Walmart spokesperson added this is the \u201clatest in a series of investments in hourly and salaried roles across Walmart US.\u201d\n\nLast year Walmart made changes to pay packages for both US store managers and hourly employees. The company increased salaries for its store manager position, with the average starting at $128,000 a year. Walmart also changed the managers\u2019 bonus program so store profits will play a bigger role \u2014 not just sales.\n\nAlso in 2024, Walmart started a bonus program for its hourly employees who have been loyal to the company. Employees can earn a bonus based on years of service, up to a maximum of $1,000 for those with the company 20 years or more.\n\nWalmart, America\u2019s biggest employer, has an outsized impact on the labor market for hourly workers. And like many retailers, the company has been grappling with finding and retaining the workers it needs in a tight labor market. In a bid to attract them, Walmart has raised hourly wages by around 30% over the last few years, bringing its current average US hourly wage close to $18. Starting hourly pay ranges from $14 to $19 depending on the store and local market.\n\nMeanwhile, business has been booming for Walmart. Sales at its US stores open for at least a year grew about 5% in last quarter compared with the year prior, the company said in its most recent earnings report, and its profit grew 8%.\n\nWalmart has drawn in higher-income customers by investing in its grocery business and using its massive scale to drive down prices during a historic bout of inflation. It has also sharpened its assortment of clothing, electronics, home furnishings and other goods. It has also bolstered its online operations against Amazon, with sales growing 22% in the US last quarter.\n\nThe company will release its next earnings report in February.",

            "content": "To put it simply: I\u2019m a good cook, but a lazy one. I often avoid making meals from scratch because I don\u2019t have the time. When my work day is finally done, I just want to lounge on the couch and turn on my favorite comfort TV shows, but this year, I\u2019m determined to cook more, make healthier food choices, and order less takeout. So far, so good.\n\nI had the pleasure of reviewing The Pioneer Woman 6-Quart Digital Slow Cooker from Walmart, and it has been a game-changer in my daily routine. I\u2019m still able to relax after work but now with the bonus of a home-cooked meal that tastes delicious and requires minimal effort to prepare. The $35 countertop appliance is my secret weapon for low-lift dishes that come out fantastic every single time.\n\nThe Pioneer Woman 6-Quart Digital Slow Cooker\n\nWalmart\n\nBefore adding The Pioneer Woman\u2019s slow cooker to my kitchen, I had a Crock-Pot that was much smaller and not as user-friendly. I so badly wanted to use it for comfort meals, but I rarely reached for it. Anytime I tried to use it, the size didn\u2019t fit the recipes I was trying to make. I knew if I had the right slow cooker for my needs, I\u2019d be unstoppable in the kitchen.\n\nSince swapping to The Pioneer Woman\u2019s 6-quart option from Walmart, it\u2019s made my life much easier. Thanks to its electronic display, I can keep track of how long it\u2019s been cooking and adjust accordingly. Making mouth-watering recipes is as simple as mixing together ingredients in the morning, popping on the lid, setting the timer and heat level, and then going about my routine as usual. When I\u2019m tired at night I don\u2019t have to panic about what I\u2019m going to cook\u2014I already have food waiting for me. Not only has this helped me fall back in love with cooking, but it\u2019s saved me money from no longer ordering takeout. My first meal of honey garlic chicken came out perfect and was filled with flavor.\n\nAli Faccenda\n\nAside from being aesthetically pleasing, the speckled slow cooker\u2014which is also available in bright teal\u2014is foolproof. It has a locking lid and a stoneware dishwasher-safe insert (aka the bowl that holds the ingredients) which is incredibly easy to clean and required minimal elbow grease to get it sparkling like new again.\n\nShoppers agree that it\u2019s super easy to use and the ideal size. Even after the timer runs out, the slow cooker goes into warming mode for two hours, which one reviewer said comes in handy if you\u2019re away from home when the initial timer ends. Another person said it warms up right away but doesn\u2019t overheat or burn food inside.\n\nGrab my favorite kitchen appliance, The Pioneer Woman 6-Quart Digital Slow Cooker and keep scrolling for more models available at Walmart.\n\nCrock-Pot Manual 7-Quart Slow Cooker\n\nWalmart\n\nBeautiful 6-Quart Programmable Slow Cooker\n\nWalmart\n\nMainstays 6-Quart Oval Slow Cooker\n\nWalmart\n\nNinja Foodi Possible 8.5-Quart Multi-Cooker",

            "content": "Walmart continues to boost the pay of its managers, according to The Wall Street Journal Thursday. The latest pay increase targets market managers, who oversee groups of Walmart locations. These workers can earn between $420,000 and $620,000 if they receive their full bonuses this year.\n\nBiggest news for grocery?\n\nMinimum base pay for managers will rise from $130,000 to $160,000, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, while the maximum base pay will reach $260,000 annually. Stock grants will increase from $75,000 to $100,000, and potential annual bonuses will increase from 90% of base pay to 100%, the Journal reported.\n\nWalmart continues to prioritize its managers. In January 2024, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer announced that store managers would start receiving an annual stock grant in 2024. The stock bonus could reach as much as $20,000 annually, depending on the size of the store. Managers have also recently received a new compensation plan that includes a pay raise and a redesigned bonus structure. The new starting annual base wage will range from $90,000 to $170,000, bringing the average up to $128,000. Previously, store managers earned between $65,000 and $170,000.\n\nLower-ranking workers have also seen added perks over the past year. A new bonus plan announced in June allows hourly store workers to earn up to $1,000 in bonuses annually. In late 2023, Walmart raised hourly wages to $18 an hour.In November, Sam\u2019s Club increased its minimum wage to $16 an hour.\n\nWithout a fight\n\nWhile many grocers continue to fight with unions about pay and benefits\u2014such as Kroger\u2019s ongoing battle with King Soopers and City Market workers in Colorado\u2014Walmart is ensuring it takes care of its workforce with competitive annual pay and other benefits. In December, Walmart issued a press release outlining the steps it has taken to reward its employees. The announcement revealed that over 130,000 U.S. associates were promoted to roles with greater responsibility and higher pay during fiscal year 2024.\n\nIt's not a trend with other retailers\n\nFew retailers have done more for their workers than Walmart in recent months. In September, Amazon raised hourly pay for workers in its transportation and fulfillment network by at least $1.50 per hour, bringing the average base salary to over $22 an hour. In October, Hobby Lobby also raised its full-time hourly wage to $19.25.\n\nThere\u2019s the good, and the bad\n\nHowever, it hasn\u2019t been all raises and bonuses for Walmart associates. A new healthcare plan option introduced higher deductibles, according to The Wall Street Journal, and last year, many employees at offices in Bentonville and other locations were called back to work in person. The Journal also reported that Walmart reduced total compensation for some employees outside of Bentonville.",

The broth\u2019s packaging may have compromised the product\u2019s sterility. Subsequently, this could lead to the product spoiling.\n\nThe recalled products have a \u201cbest if used by\u201d date of March 25, 2026, and feature a UPC of 007874206684. Since the initial announcement, the recall risk factor has been elevated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recalling firm is TreeHouse Foods of British Columbia, Canada, according to Newsweek. The broth was sold in Walmart stores in nine U.S. states: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.\n\n\u201cThe health and safety of our customers is always a top priority,\u201d a statement from Walmart read, as published by TODAY. \u201cAs soon as we were made aware of the issue, we took action to remove all impacted (products) from \u2026 select, impacted stores. We are continuing to work with the supplier to investigate.\u201d\n\nTypically, the FDA has three different classifications for recalls: Class I, Class II, and Class III. On Jan. 21, 2025, the FDA classified the Great Value Brand of chicken broth as a Class II.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the FDA\u2019s website, a Class II recall is \u201ca situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote\u201d\n\nWhat Are Other Recent Walmart Recalls?\n\nWalmart updates its recall list regularly. The following are products currently on that list along with the upgraded chicken broth recall.\n\nOn Jan. 15, 2025, the FDA issued a Quaker recall of a limited number of 2-pound boxes of Pearl Milling Company Original Pancake & Waffle Mix that may contain undeclared milk. On Jan. 9, the Food Safety and Inspection Service issued a public health alert for a frozen product labeled as Chicken Curry Empanadas that may contain Apple Cinnamon Empanadas, containing milk that is not declared on the product label.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 2024, the FDA issued a precautionary advisory of a single production lot of washed and ready-to-eat 12-ounce Marketside Broccoli Florets with a \u201cbest if used by\u201d date of Dec. 10, 2024. Customers who freeze this product for later use should discard it and not eat it.\n\nAlso in December, Palermo Palermo Villa, Inc. issued a recall of 1,728 Connie\u2019s Thin Crust Cheese Frozen Pizzas because of a possible plastic foreign contaminant. The product was distributed in Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin to retail grocery stores. The affected product has a past-due expiration date of Nov. 27, 2024, but could still remain in customers\u2019 freezers.\n\nAs with any recalled items, Walmart suggests returning to the store for a refund or discarding the items at home.",

The base salary for these positions begins at a cool $160,000 and goes as high as $260,000. That\u2019s a 25 percent increase in starting base pay.

Walmart Luminate researchers will help brands design surveys to collect customer feedback on new or existing products. Walmart will offer the tests to customers from Walmart\u2019s Customer Spark community, an invitation-only group of Walmart shoppers the retailer has used to conduct surveys with since 2018 and began utilizing for Luminate clients in 2022.\n\nSuppliers often turn to third-party research companies rather than retailers to perform market research, such as product testing. Now, Walmart will also do this by tapping into the company\u2019s uniquely massive customer base and data capabilities.\n\nWalmart Luminate\u2019s customers include the companies behind some of the biggest brands found in the aisles and online, such as The Hershey Company and Kimberly-Clark. The platform also allows suppliers and brands to look at information, such as sales figures, inventory levels, data on shopping patterns and results from customer perception surveys. Last year, the platform introduced a tool called Insights Activation, which integrates with Walmart\u2019s retail media network, Walmart Connect, to identify media strategies based on Walmart Luminate data.\n\nDuracell was among the first brands to give Walmart\u2019s user tests a try in September ahead of a new packaging launch. According to Walmart, Duracell wanted to ensure its new paper-based packaging resonated with shoppers. It specifically targeted Walmart shoppers who had previously purchased batteries. Walmart said Duracell found that battery buyers overwhelmingly preferred the new packaging and appreciated the move to recyclable packaging.\n\n\u201cOther research companies may have to tap into their panels or other third-party panels, and so what makes our capability unique is obviously the scale of Walmart, but also the value of our community,\u201d Linda Lomelino, group director of product management for Walmart Data Ventures, told Modern Retail. \u201cBecause it\u2019s an invitation-only community that leverages our customer database. We know who these customers are, and we can verify their transactional and behavioral data.\u201d\n\nLomelino declined to share how many customers are part of the Customer Spark community but said it helped Walmart gather 3.4 million survey responses in 2024 and that its membership increased 30% over the past year.\n\nIn addition to being a feature to sell suppliers on Luminate, this is also a way for the retailer to make sure the right products are landing on its shelves in terms of packaging, pricing, flavor or efficacy.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is essentially helping de-risk products going to market that maybe don\u2019t resonate with customers, or helping suppliers really understand what may be wrong with a product so that they can correct those, iterate and launch better products in the future,\u201d Lomelino said.\n\nBecause product testing is typically in the domain of outside market research firms, few, if any, other retailers offer similar services to their suppliers. Amazon Vine allows customers to test products and write reviews, but that is meant to inform other customers rather than suppliers.\n\nAndrew Lipsman, an independent analyst at Media, Ads + Commerce, said this comes as brands have increasingly used e-commerce platforms as a way to test consumer demand for new product innovation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll look at the sales velocity and other metrics; if a new flavor is getting uptake from consumers, then they\u2019ll use that data to scale it broadly into the store and physical shelves,\u201d Lipsman said. \u201cIf you have consumer data on the people who were able to test the products, you can follow their behavior over time, and so, in some sense, you can determine the longer-term buying habits of those consumers and potentially understand the lifetime value of that new product development.\u201d\n\nWalmart said the program is another step toward better understanding its customers and bringing the customer voice into every stage of product development. It also added a research services team last year to assist suppliers in interpreting its data.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the journey we\u2019ve been on, we launched quantitative surveys as a capability and then qualitative interviewing as a capability; think about this as yet another muscle that we\u2019re allowing suppliers to use or another tool in their toolbox to help bring customer voice into the decision-making process,\u201d Lomelino said.",

The technology company is currently deploying its software and robotics platform at Walmart\u2019s 42 regional distribution centers in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the synergy between Symbotic\u2019s expertise and our nearly decade-long relationship in innovating the supply chain technologies to elevate customer service and rapidly advance our in-store Accelerated Pickup and Delivery capabilities,\u201d said Greg Cathey, SVP of transformation and innovation at Walmart, in the release.\n\nThe agreement between Walmart and Symbotic has a 12-year term, according to a Jan. 15 securities filing. The technology Symbotic develops for Walmart during that time will be exclusive to the retailer. However, the company expects to offer the technology to the entire retail market once that exclusivity window fades, Symbotic CFO Carol Hibbard said on the conference call\n\nFor the ADPs, Walmart will use a miniaturized automation system in the back room of stores to retrieve products to fill individual customer orders for pickup or last-mile delivery, said Bill Boyd, chief strategy officer at Symbotic, on a Jan. 16 conference call.\n\nWalmart\u2019s drive to scale the use of automation has been a major theme of its supply chain evolution in the last decade.\n\nIn 2024 alone, the company automated distribution centers in Arizona and Arkansas and announced plans to add five new automated distribution centers to its grocery supply chain. It also began using autonomous forklifts at four distribution centers in Florida, Texas, New York and Alabama.\n\nBy the end of this year, the retailer expects 65% of its stores to receive merchandise from high-tech distribution centers, according to an October email to sister publication Supply Chain Dive.\n\nContinued reliance on automation technology appears to be paying off in terms of delivery efficiency for the retail giant. Walmart cut U.S. net delivery costs per order by 40% in its most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nWalmart EVP and CFO John David Rainey identified \u201cthe automation of our supply chain\u201d as one of the key factors driving the improvement, per a Nov. 19 earnings call.",

This week, more than a month after the initial recall was issued, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has provided an important update.\n\nThe recall was initiated on December 11, 2024 for 48-ounce Great Value chicken broth due to packaging that may have \"compromised the sterility of the product,\" which could lead to spoilage. The recalled products have a \"best if used by\" date of March 25, 2026 and feature a UPC of 007874206684. The broths were distributed to select Walmart stores multiple states, including Texas.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nFor weeks, the recall had not yet been assigned a classification level, meaning its severity was not clearly defined. The FDA has three different classifications for recalls, Class I, Class II and Class III. On Tuesday, January 21, the FDA officially designated the chicken broth recall as a Class II.\n\nClass II is defined as \"a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote,\" according to the FDA website. In other words, using that recalled chicken broth has the potential to make people sick, most likely temporarily.",

With Research Services, brands can work with the Walmart Research Team to develop consumer research that fits their needs and budget.\n\n\u201cWith the introduction of In-Home User Tests and Research Services, we\u2019re taking giant strides to integrate the customer voice into every stage of product development, equipping suppliers with valuable insights and enabling them to innovate faster,\u201d said Linda Lomelino, Group Director Product Management at Walmart Data Ventures in a blog post. \u201cBy taking this customer-centric approach to our suite of solutions, we\u2019re helping ensure every product that hits our shelves not only meets but exceeds customer expectations.\u201d\n\nThese new solutions for Walmart suppliers join a host of other offerings under the Walmart Luminate umbrella (which will be renamed Walmart Scintilla next month). The full suite of insight solutions under the Luminate/Scintilla banner are available to Walmart Charter subscribers that pay a subscription fee. There also is a Basic version with more limited offerings that is available for free to Walmart suppliers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ultimate goal of Luminate/Scintilla \u2014 which, in addition to In-Home User Tests also includesquantitative studies, qualitative video studies, quick surveys and behavioral insights such as purchasing patterns \u2014 is to capture customer feedback and sentiment in order to help suppliers integrate the verified voice of the customer into the product development lifecycle.\n\nThis feedback is gathered from the Walmart Customer Spark Community, which is made up of invite-only, verified Walmart customers who have double opted-in to contribute their feedback. In 2024, Walmart Data Ventures captured more than 3.4 million responses from this community of customers. Suppliers can engage with the customers with even more precision by leveraging established shopping patterns to help target, segment and gain insights relevant to their particular category.\n\nEarly access for the In-Home User Tests (IHUT) service is now available to Walmart Luminate subscribers. Products will be sent to customers\u2019 homes where they will interact with them as they normally would in their day-to-day life and then provide feedback on functionality, pricing, efficacy and messaging.\n\n\u201cThe Walmart Luminate team provided us with a seamless research experience that provided invaluable insights,\u201d said Lauren Carruth, Senior Manager of Shopper Insights at Duracell in a statement. \u201cThrough the In-Home User Test research we conducted, we were able to proactively identify the packaging attributes that would best resonate with those who matter most \u2014 the shopper.\u201d",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nTreeHouse Foods, the company that makes Walmart\u2019s Great Value chicken broth that\u2019s part of a recall, said via email that the recent issue is because of an \u201cinternal procedural error that has been corrected\u201d and not the packaging materials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in its notice from Dec. 11 that the recall was due to the \u201c[p]otential for packaging failures that could compromise the sterility of the product, resulting in spoilage.\u201d\n\nThe FDA\u2019s notice shows the recall covers 2,023 cases, with 120 cases per pallet \u2014 or about 17 pallets worth of product. At six units per case, more than 12,100 cartons are affected. Walmart posted this item on its recall website Jan. 14; it shows the 48-ounce cartons of Great Value broth affected were sold in nine states.\n\nTetra Pak supplies the aseptic cartons for the broth. The company is aware of the recall, but it cannot comment on procedural operations outside its own, a spokesperson said via email. \u201cWe can only share that we are not aware of any procedural issues specific to our operations,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cIt is worth noting that a recall has not been issued for our packaging material.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDemand for private label food offerings has surged amid inflation concerns in the U.S. the last few years, with private label sales reaching a record high of $271 billion in 2024. Oak Brook, Illinois-based TreeHouse foods is the largest pure-play private label manufacturer in the United States. Besides Walmart, its customers include Aldi, Amazon, Costco, Kroger and Target.\n\nTreeHouse is no stranger to recalls, including for broth. It was at the heart of the bone broth recall at retailers such as Costco and Walmart, starting in September 2023, that contributed to an 8% drop in fourth-quarter sales that year. Repercussions stretched well beyond then, with the company reporting it experienced an impact to \u201cresults of operations throughout the first nine months of 2024.\u201d\n\nFDA recalls typically are not caused by packaging-related issues, said George Misko, senior partner at Keller & Heckman, speaking about recalls in general. \u201cIt's very seldom that you see an issue with a package that causes the actual problem that requires some type of a recall,\u201d Misko said. \u201cIt\u2019s more common to see issues in the production process \u2014 that may involve the equipment that was used to package something.\u201d\n\nTreeHouse voluntarily recalled the Great Value broth in question \u2014 as is the case with most recalls, Misko said. \u201cIt's very seldom that that FDA gets into a pushing match with a company over whether a recall is going to be done,\u201d he added.\n\nIn its email, TreeHouse described the recall as \u201cvery small.\u201d TreeHouse also said that it is \u201cnormal to have occasional deviations during production that can cause an out-of-specification result.\u201d\n\nTetra Pak similarly characterized the recall as affecting a \u201climited amount\u201d of product. \u201cFood safety and quality remains our top priority, and we cooperate fully in reviews and investigations,\u201d the Tetra Pak spokesperson said.\n\nMisko, who is part of Keller & Heckman\u2019s FDA practice group that specializes in packaging, said the aseptic cartons in the Walmart recall are a \u201cpretty sophisticated type of package. ... So those companies that make that kind of product tend to be very careful in terms of what they're doing and in watching for problems with the product as it's being produced.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that packaging-related recalls are rare, and he\u2019s seen very few in his more than 30 years of experience in the space.\n\nThe FDA notification initially listed the TreeHouse recall as \u201cunclassified\u201d before updating it to Class Two on Jan. 21.\n\nMisko described FDA\u2019s three-tiered recall system, with Class One signifying \u201cthere's a reasonable probability that use or exposure to the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\u201d An example of that could be a product with a known listeria contamination. Class Two indicates a contaminated product might cause temporary illness or discomfort. A Class Three recall is of even lesser seriousness; it could result from a situation of no known contamination but a minor impact such as the possibility for a product\u2019s smell or taste to be off.\n\nFDA requires that product manufacturers and retailers disseminate information quickly and in a widespread manner when it comes to Class One recalls, Misko said.\n\nCosmetics and food product recalls are on the rise, with the FDA reporting that the last fiscal year had the most since 2019. Recalls also are getting more granular as traceability and communication about them is more effective, according to WGBH. That means some small recalls that previously wouldn\u2019t make the public radar are now garnering more attention.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lot more company and public sensitivity to such matters now, Misko said. \u201cFood safety has become such a hot topic in the last decade or decade-and-a-half,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "Symbotic Inc., a supply chain technology firm, is expanding its eight-year partnership with Walmart Inc. by acquiring the retailer\u2019s advanced systems and robotics business for $200 million.\n\nAlongside the acquisition, Walmart will invest $520 million in Symbotic\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI)-powered robotics platform, a move meant to speed up and improve ecommerce fulfillment at its stores. By further automating its accelerated pickup and delivery systems (APDs), Walmart said it can reduce the time it takes to fulfill online orders and improve customer convenience, especially as demand grows for curbside pickup and home delivery.\n\nAnnounced on Jan. 16, the moves mark a major step forward in the companies\u2019 relationship. Massachusetts-based Symbotic, which has worked with Walmart since 2017 to automate its distribution centers, will now take control of Walmart\u2019s automation business. The acquisition is valued at $200 million in cash at closing, with an additional $350 million in potential payments contingent on how many APDs Walmart orders, Symbotic said in its announcement.\n\nWhy Walmart\u2019s robotics transaction with Symbotic is \u2018highly strategic\u2019\n\nCoinciding with the acquisition, Walmart is investing in a development program with Symbotic. The program will allow Symbotic to design, build, and deploy systems to accelerate online pickup and delivery services at stores, as well as design new systems, the companies said.\n\nIf performance targets are met, Walmart plans to purchase and deploy systems for 400 APD centers at stores over a multi-year period, with the option to add more in the future.\n\nAssociated with the development program, Walmart will pay Symbotic $520 million, including $230 million at closing, per the announcement.\n\n\u201cThis is a highly strategic transaction for Symbotic as we expand upon our long-term relationship with Walmart and broaden our product offering beyond the traditional warehouse to ecommerce settings for last-mile delivery,\u201d said Rick Cohen, Symbotic\u2019s chairman and CEO, in the announcement.\n\nSymbotic expands automation expertise\n\nFounded in 2007, Symbotic said it focuses on streamlining the supply chain with its end-to-end AI-powered robotics and software platform for industries like retail, wholesale, and food and beverage. According to the company, it leverages advanced technology, high-density storage, and machine learning to address challenges in the supply chain.\n\nSymbotic has played a major role in automating Walmart\u2019s supply chain since 2017. The company said it is currently deploying its software and robotics platform across all 42 of Walmart\u2019s regional distribution centers in the U.S.\n\nBringing its technology to Walmart\u2019s APD systems is \u201ca natural extension of this work,\u201d Symbotic said, helping Walmart fulfill ecommerce orders at stores more efficiently and economically.\n\nBy further automating APDs, Walmart can reduce the time it takes to fulfill online orders and improve customer convenience, especially as demand grows for curbside pickup and home delivery.\n\nAccording to the companies, approximately 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of Walmart\u2019s more than 4,600 stores. In its fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31, 2024, Walmart\u2019s store-fulfilled deliveries grew nearly 50% year over year, surpassing a $2.5 billion monthly run rate, it said.\n\nTransaction outlook and market expansion\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the synergy between Symbotic\u2019s expertise and our nearly decade-long relationship in innovating the supply chain technologies to elevate customer service and rapidly advance our in-store Accelerated Pickup and Delivery capabilities,\u201d said Greg Cathey, senior vice president of transformation and innovation at Walmart, in a statement.\n\nNotably, the acquisition adds a micro-fulfillment solution to Symbotic\u2019s portfolio, according to Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant and former Amazon executive. In 2022, Walmart acquired Alert Innovation \u2014 later renamed Walmart Advanced Systems & Robotics \u2014 for $400 million to implement micro-fulfillment centers in select stores, Ladd wrote in a LinkedIn post.\n\nSymbotic said adding the micro-fulfillment solution expands its addressable market by more than $300 billion in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe companies said they expect the acquisition to close in Symbotic\u2019s second fiscal quarter of 2025. Symbotic noted that the transaction and associated agreements could increase its project backlog by more than $5 billion.\n\nCompetitive pressures from Amazon\n\nAmazon is also ramping up investments in automation. According to Ladd, the company has developed its own automated micro-fulfillment system (MFC) alongside other robotic technologies to accelerate online order fulfillment. Amazon plans to deploy its MFC in a 250,000-square-foot supercenter, set to open in late 2025 or early 2026, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is a new arms race in business,\u201d Ladd wrote. \u201cWalmart and Amazon are investing billions to use automation as a way to disrupt their competitors, reduce their logistics costs, and achieve a competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nWalmart and Amazon rank No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, in the Top 1000 Database, Digital Commerce 360\u2019s ranking of the largest North American online retailers by web sales.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nFemale wellness brand Lola has expanded its product mix to include postpartum care items that are now available on its website and at Walmart stores nationwide, per a news press release.\n\nThe first collection from Lola includes a stretch mark prevention cream, organic cotton postpartum pads, and both hot and cold p erineal gel pads. While the gel pads are at 250 Walmart stores, the cream and cotton pads are being offered at 1,850 of the mass merchant\u2019s locations.\n\nSeparately, Lola said it would add to its postpartum collection with exclusive new products launching at Target stores in March. The brand also will announce a partnership with a \u201cmajor New York sports organization\u201d sometime during Q1, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nKnown for its period care products, the move into postpartum care represents a natural progression for Lola. The brand was acquired by Forum Brands in late 2023 for an undisclosed amount. Forum Brands, whose portfolio also includes Ever Skincare and Bonza, is an aggregator initially focused on acquiring brands primarily sold via Amazon but has since broadened its acquisition strategy.\n\nThe brand continues to stress its founding vision of \u201cadvocating for transparency in women\u2019s health,\u201d per a brand spokesperson.\n\n\"Every woman deserves access to clean, non-toxic, and effective postpartum care,\" Kelly Murphy, general manager of Lola, said in a statement. \"By bringing our expertise in women's wellness to the postpartum experience, we aim to empower new mothers to embrace their changing bodies with the peace of mind that they don't have to sacrifice safety and comfort for convenience.\"\n\nThe period care space has grown significantly over the past several years. Lola faces competition from a crowded field of rivals such as Honey Pot, Daye, Thinx and August. According to a recent Research and Markets report, the feminine hygiene products market will grow from approximately $30 billion in 2024 to $40 billion in 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate of 7%.\n\nA number of such brands have expanded within the category, including menstrual care brand Saalt which introduced an underwear collection at Target in 2023. Known for its absorbent underwear, Thinx expanded into activewear in 2021. And tween period care brand Pinkie expanded into over 3,300 CVS Pharmacy stores nationwide last July.\n\nLola has advocated for the removal of the so-called Tampon Tax, a menstrual tax on products for women\u2019s personal care. As of May 2024, 20 U.S. states still levied a tax on the products.",

The beer was placed on the customer service desk, where Hardwick was seen speaking with the clerk.\n\nEphraim Helton, with Helton Law Office, says Hardwick has dementia and was confused by the situation. In the surveillance video, Helton is seen speaking to a Walmart loss prevention employee. During their conversation, he places the beer in his cart and then places it back on the table several times.\n\nHelton explains Hardwick does not understand what is going on. \"Again, there's no effort to leave Walmart. There's no effort to run with this. He's following all of the directions of loss prevention. He's not throwing his arms up in the air, he's not causing a scene.\"\n\nAfter dealing with loss prevention, the video shows Hardwick walking back to the service desk with three Danville Police Officers behind him. One of the officers is seen grabbing his handcuffs to arrest Hardwick when things escalate.\n\n\"You see officer Godbey grab his handcuffs and then he doesn't understand what's going on. Slam his face into the register. Attempt at a choke hold. Throw him to the ground. Watch while he's down. One, two, three, four, five, six,\" Helton details.\n\nAccording to a citation, officers were \"flagged down by Walmart staff for Hardwick being under the influence\" and \"trying to steal beer.\" While having \"the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from\" him. The citation also reads that Hardwick \"grabbed two cases of beer and then tried to leave the store.\"\n\n\"You've seen this. There's no stealing of beer. He's not under the influence,\" said Helton.\n\nThe citation continues to read, \"Officer Godbey attempted to place his hands behind his back, above refused and tensed up having to be assisted to the prone position.\"\n\nHowever, Helton says he was body-slammed, not assisted. \"And I trust that after you've seen that, that's not being assisted to a prone position. That's being thrown to a concrete floor at 66 years of age and then he was struck six times.\"\n\nAfter Hardwick was arrested, Helton says Danville Jail staff refused to admit Hardwick because they claimed he was in a \"clear delusional state,\" so he was sent to a local hospital to be evaluated.\n\n\"Patient has a history of dementia and appears to be confused. Confused per PD. The same officer that wrote he was under the influence of alcohol told the admissions people and the nursing staff at Ephraim McDowell Regional Medical Center that he is confused,\" Helton reads from the medical report.\n\nThe Danville Police Department released this statement on Tuesday:\n\n\n\nDanville Police Officers were requested to assist Walmart loss prevention with an uncooperative and intoxicated shoplifter, who had become agitated when Walmart refused to let him purchase two cases of alcohol and other merchandise. After a store employee\n\nplaced the alcohol behind a register, the suspect walked behind the register and took possession of the unpaid alcohol and merchandise and attempted to leave the store.\n\n\n\nAfter being asked to place his hands behind his back, the suspect tensed up and refused to comply, and a short struggle ensued where the suspect was taken to the ground. An officer used strikes to the suspect\u2019s shoulder to gain suspect compliance, and the suspect was\n\ntaken into custody. Officers learned the suspect may have been suffering from a previous medical condition, aggravated by his intoxicated state, and transported him to the local hospital where he was medically cleared with no injuries. Officers consulted with family members and determined the best course of action was to release the suspect and cite him with a pending court date.\n\n\n\nAnthony Gray Jr.\n\nChief of Police\n\nDanville Police Department\n\n\n\n\n\nHardwick now faces these charges:\n\n\n\nAlcohol intoxication in a public place (1st and 2nd offense) Criminal trespassing (3rd degree) Shoplifting Resisting arrest Failure to surrender revoked operator's license No person shall have more than one operator's license\n\nHelton is trying to pursue charges against one of the officers who he believes used excessive force on the 66-year-old. Helton is requesting these charges:\n\nOffenses of Assault, fourth-degree\n\nOfficial Misconduct, first-degree\n\n\"I think it's appalling that you have a 66-year-old man face down on the ground, and you are striking him six times. He is defenseless. His hands were behind his back, he's handcuffed. It is totally unnecessary. That is police brutality,\" said Helton.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWalmart is selling its advanced systems and robotics business to Symbotic to improve online order pickup and delivery fulfillment, according to a Jan. 16 press release.\n\nUnder a development agreement, Symbotic will build and develop an AI-enabled robotics platform to automate accelerated pickup and delivery centers (APDs) for the retailer, per the release.\n\nWalmart will invest $520 million to fund the development program and purchase and deploy 400 APDs from Symbotic over a multi-year period, with the option of adding more, the release said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWalmart is offloading its robotics business to a technology partner to accelerate automation technology development for its fulfillment operations.\n\nSymbotic has partnered with Walmart to automate the retailer\u2019s supply chain since 2017, per the release. The technology company is currently deploying its software and robotics platform at Walmart\u2019s 42 regional distribution centers in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the synergy between Symbotic\u2019s expertise and our nearly decade-long relationship in innovating the supply chain technologies to elevate customer service and rapidly advance our in-store Accelerated Pickup and Delivery capabilities,\u201d said Greg Cathey, SVP of transformation and innovation at Walmart, in the release.\n\nThe agreement between Walmart and Symbotic has a 12-year term, according to a Jan. 15 securities filing. The technology Symbotic develops for Walmart during that time will be exclusive to the retailer. However, the company expects to offer the technology to the entire retail market once that exclusivity window fades, Symbotic CFO Carol Hibbard said on a Jan. 16 conference call.\n\nFor the ADPs, Walmart will use a miniaturized automation system in the back room of stores to retrieve products to fill individual customer orders for pickup or last-mile delivery, said Bill Boyd, chief strategy officer at Symbotic, on the conference call.\n\nWalmart\u2019s drive to scale the use of automation has been a major theme of its supply chain evolution in the last decade.\n\nIn 2024 alone, the company automated distribution centers in Arizona and Arkansas and announced plans to add five new automated distribution centers to its grocery supply chain. It also began using autonomous forklifts at four distribution centers in Florida, Texas, New York and Alabama.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access Food Delivery and the Bottom Line, from the editorial teams at C-Store Dive, Grocery Dive, Supply Chain Dive and Restaurant Dive.

Walmart cut U.S. net delivery costs per order by 40% in its most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nWalmart EVP and CFO John David Rainey identified \u201cthe automation of our supply chain\u201d as one of the key factors driving the improvement, per a Nov. 19 earnings call.",

The company is benefiting from its diverse business model that spans multiple segments, channels and formats. The company's strong omnichannel strategy has boosted traffic across physical stores and digital platforms.\n\n\n\nIts emphasis on improving delivery services has been successful, contributing to steady grocery market share gains. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year, and e-commerce sales surged.\n\nHowever, Walmart is experiencing adverse currency movements and margin pressures from shifts in product mix. While raising its fiscal 2025 guidance, the company\u2019s implied fourth-quarter view for revenues and operating income reflects a slowdown from the reported third-quarter figures.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\n\nShares of Marvell Technology have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (+93.3% vs. +58.5%). The company is benefiting from the strong demand environment across the data center end market.\n\nIn Q3, its data center end market revenues increased 98% year over year and 25% sequentially, propelled by strong revenue growth across artificial intelligence (AI)-driven demand for PAM products and ZR electro-optics. Completion of inventory digestions is likely to aid growth across the enterprise networking and carrier infrastructure end markets.\n\nHowever, weakening consumer spending amid the protracted high inflationary conditions and still-high interest rates is likely to hurt its sales across the Consumer segment. Enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans amid the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. This is likely to hurt its performance in the near term.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Marvell Technology here >>>)\n\nAmphenol shares have gained +4% over the past six months against the Zacks Electronics - Connectors industry\u2019s gain of +5.2%. The company is benefiting from its strong portfolio of solutions, including high-technology interconnect products. Expanding spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies bodes well for APH\u2019s top-line growth.\n\nApart from Defense, Amphenol\u2019s prospects ride on strong demand for its solutions across Commercial Air, Industrial, and Mobile devices. APH expects sales in the defense market to increase moderately on a sequential basis. For 2024, it expects mid-teens increase in sales from the Defense market.\n\nAmphenol\u2019s diversified business model lowers the volatility of individual end markets and geographies. Strong cash flow generating ability is noteworthy.

            "content": "\u2715\n\nThe small Arkansas city of Bentonville and neighboring towns have emerged in recent years as a collective hotbed of elevated architecture thanks in part to the largesse of the Northwest Arkansas Design Excellence Program, which draws talented practitioners from across the country to the region\u2014home to late AIA Gold Medalist Fay Jones and his namesake architecture school\u2014for high-profile public commissions.\n\nThe concept of good design seemingly skipped over the longtime Bentonville headquarters of Walmart, whose private family foundation funds the Design Excellence Program. Nondescript, outdated, and lacking in windows, the 1970s-era home office of the largest private employer in the region\u2014and the world\u2014stands as a forgettable relic clinging to the mega-retailer\u2019s thrifty, no-frills roots. This is especially true when comparing Walmart headquarters with other major American corporate campuses that have been overhauled to emphasize on-site amenities, employee well-being, flexibility, and indoor-outdoor connectivity.\n\nIn a nod to the surrounding Ozarkian landscape, the campus features multiple manmade lakes capable of treating up to 12 million gallons of stormwater annually. Photo by David Lloyd, SWA\n\nWalmart\u2019s presence in Bentonville, however, has entered a new era as the company celebrates the opening of its much improved home office campus, a project led by Gensler with SWA. With demolition and infrastructure work first kicking off at the site in 2019, its (partial, phased) debut comes ahead of several other major projects in Bentonville slated to open later this year and the next, including a trio of endeavors led by Walmart heiress Alice Walton: an expansion of the Moshe Safdie\u2013designed Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (also led by Safdie\u2019s firm), the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine (Polk Stanley Wilcox and OSD), and the Heartland Whole Health Institute (Marlon Blackwell Architects). Also scheduled to open this year is the renovated Walmart Museum located at the old Walton\u2019s 5&10 variety store on Bentonville\u2019s town square.\n\nExterior of the campus welcome pavilion and merch shop, located in the northwest corner of the campus next to the 153-key AC Hotel Bentonville by Marriott. Photo courtesy Walmart\n\nLocated several miles away from the company\u2019s cramped, brick-clad old headquarters, the new campus encompasses an underutilized site adjacent to Bentonville\u2019s Third Street Historic District that was previously populated by several Walmart warehouse facilities and support buildings. Spread across 350 densely wooded acres, the new campus\u2014\u201cbuilt with associates, for associates\u201d \u2014showcases mass timber construction and the region\u2019s natural beauty.\n\n\n\n1\n\n2 The campus features several mass-timber structures, one of them pictured here under construction (1), and a grassy outdoor event space (2). Photos courtesy Walmart\n\nThe sprawling complex\u2019s dozen office buildings, the first two of which are now open, are predominately built from mass timber, including 1.7 million cubic square feet of regionally sourced lumber according to Gensler. (The firm served as design architect of the office buildings, overseeing architecture and interiors, and executive architect of the overall campus design, working from a Sasaki-concieved master plan. It also designed the campus retail spaces, parking structures, and a coffee shop.) With 2.4 million square feet of office space constructed from mass timber, the project is billed as the largest campus project of its kind in the United States. Incorporating numerous sustainable design strategies, the LEED Platinum\u2013aiming mass-timber office buildings are powered entirely by renewable energy and feature high-efficiency HVAC and lighting systems.\n\nJoining Gensler\u2019s assemblage of office buildings are numerous other structures: a large standalone health and fitness center that opened ahead of the larger campus, a 73,000-square-foot childcare center, a 12-vendor food hall, a Marriott-operated hotel, a welcome pavilion, and multiple parking structures. Anchoring the campus is Sam Walton Hall, a 200,000-square-foot corporate training and conference center designed by local firm Miller Boskus Lack Architects that includes a 1,500-seat auditorium. Directly adjacent to the hall is Helen\u2019s Amphitheater, a terraced outdoor event venue. All of the office buildings are oriented around spacious quads, all of which feature dedicated plazas for rotating food trucks and shady spots to sit and unwind.\n\n\n\n3\n\n4 An associate work area (3) and lobby (4) in the Cheer Building, one of 12 office blocks on the campus. The names of other buildings include Moon Pie, Maverick, Hula, and Ol\u2019 Roy, named after Sam Walton\u2019s hunting dog. Photos courtesy Walmart\n\nDeveloped by SWA, the home office\u2019s \u201cBig Nature\u201d landscape plan brings the rugged appeal of the nearby Ozark Mountains to Walmart\u2019s front yard. Designed to \u201cdissolve the boundaries between new facilities and surrounding landscapes,\u201d key features of the campus include 115 acres of native and adaptive planting, 13 acres of lakes and bioswales at the northern and southern ends of the site that aid in stormwater management, and a one-mile-long forested greenway that bisects campus to link it with the Razorback Regional Greenway and the Town Branch Trail, the latter of which provides a direct connection via tunnel to downtown Bentonville. Given the very evident popularity of bicycling in and around town, the campus is also laced with a nearly 7-mile network of multimodal soft surface and paved trails; there are also 1,000 bike parking spaces. (A somewhat diminutive figure when considering that the campus was built to accommodate 15,000 daily on-site Walmart employees, roughly half of them living within 5 miles of the new home office in the rapidly growing region.)\n\n\u201cLike many, we spent the past few years seeking solace in the outdoors and found extraordinary beauty in the landscapes where the Ozarks melt into lowland hills,\u201d says SWA co-CEO Gerdo Aquino in a statement. \u201cThat was really our jumping-off point: to instill feelings of rootedness, authenticity, and home by folding those ecosystems into the design.\u201d\n\n\n\n5\n\n6 The entrance (5) and rotunda (6) of Walton Family Whole Health and Fitness, the first on-campus amenity to open. The 360,000-square-foot facility was designed by North Carolina\u2013based Duda|Paine Architects. Photos by David Lloyd, SWA (5) and courtesy Walmart (6)\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s not yet clear what future redevelopment might entail for the old Walmart home office once it is fully vacated and the phased opening of the new campus is complete. One thing that is certain is that it will stay in the family. In 2022, the property was acquired for $60 million by the real estate development arm of a holding company led by Steuart and Tom Walton, grandsons of Walmart founder Sam Walton. The cost of the new home office, which will continue its gradual unveiling throughout the year, has not been disclosed by the company.",

            "content": "Randolph Knoblock was booked into Sonoma County jail and charged with assault with a deadly weapon, assault with caustic chemicals, elder abuse and false imprisonment.\n\nA Santa Rosa man was arrested by the Rohnert Park Police Department Monday after he allegedly assaulted customers at Walmart, leaving two customers and an employee injured.\n\nAt 2:28 p.m., Randolph Knoblock, Jr. 45, started a fight in the electronics department of the big-box store at 4625 Redwood Drive, police said. Knoblock pinned a Walmart employee on the ground and was dousing the person with what appeared to be pepper spray, Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety Lt. Andrew Smith said.\n\nSteve Hummel, 68, and his wife were buying supplies in Walmart for their new kitten when they heard the commotion in the electronics department.\n\nConcerned by a woman\u2019s scream and the rhetoric a man was yelling, Hummel sent his wife to the car while he walked over to see what was happening.\n\nAs he turned the aisle corner, Hummel found a Walmart employee had been knocked to the floor, his face bleeding from wounds. Knoblock was allegedly stomping his boot on the side of the employee\u2019s face with full force, Hummel said.\n\nHummel, who believed Knoblock would seriously injure the Walmart employee, ran and tackled Knoblock to the ground.\n\n\u201cI tried to hold him there from behind with my arm around his neck, hoping others would come to help hold him for the police,\u201d Hummel said.\n\nInstead, Knoblock sprayed Hummel with what he described as bear spray, point-blank in the face. The attack enabled Knoblock to pull free from Hummel\u2019s hold.\n\nRohnert Park police were called after the fight in the electronics department ended, Smith said, and arrived at the store within three minutes.\n\nBy then, Knoblock had left the electronics department and made his way outside the store. Once outside, Knoblock started another fight with a male customer, police said.\n\nBrandishing a knife, Knoblock grabbed the man by the shirt and yelled, \u201cGet on your knees!\u201d Two additional Walmart employees tried to intervene as more Rohnert Park police officers arrived.\n\nSmith said Knoblock continued to yell and scream \u201cnonsensical things,\u201d including invoking President Trump to save him, as he entered into a standoff with police. Eventually, police officers tackled and restrained Knoblock.\n\nKnoblock was booked into Sonoma County jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, assault with caustic chemicals, elder abuse and false imprisonment. He is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday.\n\nThree people were injured in the incident. Two customers were treated for pepper/bear spray injuries and an employee was transported to the hospital.\n\nSmith said he was unsure if drugs, alcohol or mental health issues were a factor in the incident.\n\nClarification (Jan. 21, 2025, 2:28 p.m.): This story has been updated to reflect the alleged attacker\u2019s correct name.\n\nAmie Windsor is the Community Journalism Team Lead with The Press Democrat.

Cally Connelly is on her break, combing through racks of clothes.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m a shopaholic, so I\u2019m at T.J. Maxx just looking around, not for anything in particular,\u201d she says, hesitantly calling herself a Maxxinista, which is how the store refers to its dedicated customers. \u201cI\u2019m not here, like, every day, but I do really like it here.\u201d\n\nConnelly comes to the store a couple of times a month, and it\u2019s one of the few places she still shops in person. On a wall nearby, a sign reads: \u201cNew styles arrive weekly. Shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just always something special and new,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like they always have new stuff here.\u201d\n\nT.J. Maxx is one of those wacky places where you can buy a designer handbag, pasta sauce or a set of silver and gold water bottles in the shape of a croissant. The good deals and constant rotation of new stuff are reasons that discount retailers are doing well right now. T.J. Maxx\u2019s sales have grown and its stock price has about doubled over the last half decade.\n\nBut it is an outlier in what\u2019s otherwise been a tough time for retailers. Between January and November of 2024, U.S. retailers closed 7,300 locations and about 50 companies filed for bankruptcy \u2014 double the number in 2023, according to Coresight Research. That\u2019s all despite the fact that consumer spending has held pretty strong, with this past holiday sales season being the biggest yet.\n\nThe shifts happening in the industry have brought back a familiar term: \u201cretail apocalypse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say \u2018apocalypse,\u2019 but I would say a \u2018readjustment,\u201d\u2018 said Nicole DeHoratius, a professor of practice at Columbia Business School.\n\nReadjustment, of course, is a part of the natural churn of business. But the big challenge for retailers is they increasingly have to be everywhere: online, in person and everything in between, with offerings like curbside pickup and easy returns. It\u2019s hard to do all of that well.\n\n\u201cI was trying to think of the last time I was delighted in a retail shopping experience,\u201d DeHoratius said. \u201cAnd I have to say it\u2019s been quite a while.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re probably familiar with these scenes. You go to a store and the counter is cluttered with returned clothes. Or you go online to see if the pizza stone you\u2019ve been eyeing is in stock at your nearest store, only to arrive and find an empty shelf.\n\nThe integration of online and in-person shopping saps retailers\u2019 ability to do any one thing well. \u201cI think it\u2019s totally possible to do all things,\u201d DeHoratius said. \u201cBut the question is: Is it going to be the companies that just have funding?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s why just a few companies have become people\u2019s go-to for everything from food to footwear.\n\n\u201cTo the victor go the spoils, right?\u201d said Aaron Cheris, who leads the e-commerce division at Bain & Co., a large management-consulting company. \u201cLike, if you sort of looked at retail over the last decade, more than half of the growth in U.S. retail has come from Walmart, Amazon and Costco.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly in retail, it takes money to make money. And to compete, retailers have to be the best.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that if you\u2019re not what I would call the \u2018-est\u2019 on something,\u201d said Cheris, referring to the cheapest, fastest or highest quality, \u201cthen it\u2019s really hard to win.\u201d\n\nIf a smaller company hopes to win, it has to focus. Which brings us back to T.J. Maxx, one of the few retailers that gets away with not doing it all, online and in person, and instead leans into offering products that are affordable and special.\n\n\u201cI found a light green \u2014 I would call it pistachio \u2014 House of Harlow blazer,\u201d says Connelly, bragging about the best deal she\u2019s ever snagged at the store. \u201cAnd originally I think it\u2019s, like, $180. I got it for $50. Favorite thing I\u2019ve ever owned for sure. Love it.\u201d",

In May 2024, Capital One and Walmart announced they were ending their partnership, and later that summer, Capital One closed applications for both the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae and the closed-loop, store-only Walmart Rewards Card. Existing cardholders were to be transitioned to the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card.\n\nFor true-blue Walmart fans, the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae is a value magnet, whether you shop with the retailer in-store or online. After all, you're earning rich rewards on many already discounted items.\n\nThose rewards include:\n\n5% back on Walmart.com and Walmart app purchases.\n\n2% back on in-store purchases at Walmart (including at Murphy USA and Walmart fuel stations).\n\n2% back on travel and restaurants.\n\n1% back on everything else.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can make the most out of the $0-annual-fee Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae.\n\nDownload the Walmart app\n\nWhen you use Walmart's mobile app in tandem with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae, you'll earn the same rich 5% back on purchases that you do at Walmart.com. But having the app comes in handy regardless, as it's a useful shopping tool on its own.\n\nYou can create a shopping list, view the store's weekly ad, get a price check with the barcode scanner, initiate returns, easily reorder your must-have items, refill Walmart pharmacy prescriptions and more.\n\nYou can even apply for the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae via the Walmart app after sending a text from your mobile device. What's more, if you're approved for the card and your ID is verified, the Walmart app offers immediate access to the card for Walmart.com purchases, without having to wait for the physical version to come in the mail. (You can use the card immediately inside physical Walmart stores, too, if you've also signed up for Walmart Pay, a digital wallet accessible via the Walmart app).\n\nUse Walmart Pay for rich introductory in-store rewards\n\nSpeaking of Walmart Pay, sign up for it when you get the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae. That's because the card offers Earn 5% back on purchases in Walmart stores when you use this card in Walmart Pay for the first 12 months after approval. That's far better than the ongoing 2% rate you'll otherwise get with the card inside brick-and-mortar Walmart stores.\n\nWalmart Pay allows you to expedite the checkout process while shopping inside Walmart. Instead of using your physical card, the mobile wallet stores your account information, which allows you to check out with your smartphone at the register.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\nBuy online, pick up in store\n\nWe get it: Maybe you're suffering from digital wallet fatigue, and maybe you're not fully sold on an online-only shopping approach. Sometimes you just have to browse a store's physical aisles, whether to inspect those oranges yourself or make sure those shoes actually fit.\n\nLucky for you, you'll still earn 5% back with the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae if you order items online and later head to the store to pick them up. True, it's not as easy as having products shipped directly to you. But if you're already planning to step out and run errands anyway, why not place at least a portion of your order ahead of time, skip any kind of shipping charges, and get the highest rate back for those purchases while you're at it.\n\nThis strategy can come in especially handy on big-ticket items such as pricey electronics. If you're in need of a new flat-screen TV, you could buy it in a physical Walmart and get 2% back \u2014 or you could buy it online, pick it up in your local store, and snag 5% back on it.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Walmart advertises free shipping on purchases of more than $35, but anything below that and you'll owe a fee for delivery.\n\nMake Walmart your grocery store (if it makes sense)\n\nIf you're willing to make Walmart your exclusive grocer and you don't mind letting someone else do the actual shopping for your food, the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae can make it worth your while. That's because the card's 5% rate also applies to the Walmart Grocery Pickup and Delivery service.\n\nThis may not be a practical option for everyone: You'll have to spend a minimum of $30 for all Walmart Grocery orders. And while pickup won't cost you anything extra, delivery is neither free nor available at every Walmart location.\n\nStill, an unlimited 5% back on groceries is stellar, so the extra effort could be worth it.\n\nLook first to Walmart fuel stations\n\nYou can find cards that offer higher rates on gas purchases, but if you're using the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae as your everyday card, 2% back on gas at Murphy USA and Walmart gas stations still adds up. And it's better than the 1% back you'd earn at any other fuel stations.\n\nSpecifically at Murphy USA stations, be on the lookout for savings throughout the year when you pay for gas with a Walmart gift card or Walmart-branded credit card. You can guzzle even more rewards via the Murphy Drive Rewards app. It earns additional points on gas that can be redeemed for purchases at Murphy locations.\n\nTreat yourself to dinner\n\nThe ability to earn bonus rewards on Walmart groceries is nice, and nicer still is the ability to earn elevated rewards at qualifying restaurants. You have to eat, after all \u2014 and any time you do so at cafes, bars, fast-food chains, bakeries and other eligible dining establishments, the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae will earn you 2% back.\n\nThat's a decent rate and it makes the card even more valuable for everyday use. But keep in mind that if restaurants represent an outsize portion of your budget, other cards can serve up a larger side of rewards with your meal.\n\nPay for travel (and book it via Capital One)\n\nBetter credit cards exist for frequent travelers, but the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae is an adequate option if you don\u2019t get away all that much.\n\nIt earns 2% back in a broad range of travel categories including airlines, hotels, car rentals, ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft, taxi services, and rail and bus rides, to name a few.\n\nIt also travels well abroad. There are no foreign transaction fees, and as a Mastercard it's widely accepted internationally. Travel benefits such as travel accident insurance, baggage delay insurance, car rental insurance, trip cancellation insurance and others can also save you money if unexpected events derail your vacation plans.\n\nOn the redemption side, you can use the points you earn on the Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae to book trips through the Capital One travel portal. (Points are always worth a penny each, regardless of how you redeem.)\n\nTake advantage of the card\u2019s retail benefits\n\nThe Capital One\u00ae Walmart Rewards\u2122 Mastercard\u00ae also includes protections for your purchases. For example, extended warranty doubles an original manufacturer\u2019s warranty and store-brand purchased warranty of 24 months or less for a total of up to 48 months.",

            "content": "With Wall Street seemingly focused only on artificial intelligence and GLP-1 weight-loss drug stocks lately, it might surprise some of these investors to learn that Walmart (WMT 1.01%) was actually a solid growth stock in 2024. A look at its total return performance would show that it blew past the S&P 500 as well as many other popular growth stocks.\n\nRetail stocks in general are seeing improvement as inflation moderates, and 2025 could be another great year for Walmart, the largest retailer in the world. Here are three reasons why investors might want to consider buying it this year.\n\n1. Consumers are spending again\n\nAs inflation rates return to more normal levels and interest rates continue falling, consumer spending could start to pick up. Walmart has multiple avenues for being on the receiving end of a big chunk of that. One avenue is simply that it's the largest retailer in the U.S. by sales, and naturally, people shop in its stores. It has more than 4,600 stores in the country and nearly $674 billion in trailing 12-month sales.\n\nAnother reason Walmart will benefit from increased consumer spending is that it's a discount retailer targeting a mass audience. This is the population that has been most affected by elevated inflation, and as it eases, they can go back to spending more. If higher inflation persists, these customers will spend their dollars more carefully at discount retailers like Walmart.\n\nInterest rates only started to fall in September 2024, so the full effect has not yet been felt. The Federal Reserve made three prime lending rate cuts in 2024 but, in its most recent meeting, the Fed gave indications that it might not need to make further cuts in the near future. But if it does, that could be even more favorable for Walmart's business.\n\n2. Walmart is gaining in e-commerce\n\nWalmart manages the No. 2 spot in the U.S. for e-commerce, but that may sound better than the reality. Walmart accounts for around 6% of U.S. e-commerce sales, a fraction of Amazon's (AMZN 2.09%) market share of around 38%.\n\nWalmart's e-commerce business has been growing though, and it was responsible for much of the company's excellent third-quarter performance. While overall sales increased by 5.5% year over year in fiscal 2025's Q3 (ended Oct. 31, 2024), U.S. e-commerce sales increased by 22%. What Walmart has as an advantage over any other U.S. retailer is its unrivaled store count that it's been using as delivery hubs. This is also an edge over Amazon, which maintains far fewer distribution centers.\n\nAmazon is working to restructure its U.S. logistics network, first switching from a national to a regional network specifically to compete with faster delivery. Now, it's working on its inbound network to get products to its regional fulfillment centers faster. Walmart already has such a network in place. Another edge Walmart has versus Amazon with this model is that it offers in-store pickup.\n\nE-commerce plays other roles in creating new opportunities for Walmart. It offers greater merchandise variation on the digital platform, including more expensive items than it features in many of its stores. This provides it with exposure to a more affluent clientele that doesn't frequent its physical locations. That's another market that Walmart hasn't served in a big way in the past, but that can promote higher sales.\n\nWhether or not higher inflation persists, e-commerce can add more sales to the whole in 2025.\n\n3. Don't forget Walmart's dividend\n\nWalmart pays a growing dividend that adds value for any kind of investor. Because dividend yield and price move conversely, Walmart's dividend currently yields a low 0.9%. Historically, it's usually been around 1.5%.\n\nDividend stocks are an important component of any portfolio because they're usually steady under pressure. Even if the stock price should falter, strong companies will work hard to maintain (and continue to raise) their dividend payouts. So whatever happens to Walmart stock this year, the dividend should come through. Investors should also note that even during the pandemic, when some companies did suspend their dividends, Walmart didn't.\n\nLike any great stock, investors should buy Walmart for its long-term opportunities and stability, not just for what it could do in 2025. It could beat the S&P 500 again this year, but its greater value lies in its long-term strength as a retail giant.",

While the retailer is not named in the lawsuit, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC that Walmart is at the center of the allegations.\n\nThe FTC claims that PepsiCo violated the Robinson-Patman Act, a federal law designed to ensure fair competition among businesses. The law prohibits companies from offering different prices or benefits to competing buyers for the same product, as well as from selectively granting allowances such as advertising reimbursements. Per NBC, the commission alleges that PepsiCo extended promotional payments, allowances, and advertising tools to Walmart that were not made available to its competitors.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, PepsiCo has strongly denied the allegations. The company issued a statement to CNBC asserting that the FTC\u2019s claims are both legally and factually incorrect. \u201cPepsiCo strongly disputes the FTC\u2019s allegations, and the partisan manner in which the suit was filed. We will vigorously present our case in court,\u201d the company stated. PepsiCo also emphasized that its practices align with industry standards and insisted it does not engage in favoritism by offering discounts or promotional benefits to select customers.\n\nThe lawsuit, which has been filed in the Southern District of New York, is currently sealed. According to NBC, Walmart has not yet commented on the matter.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s renewed focus on enforcing the Robinson-Patman Act signals a broader effort to address competitive imbalances in the marketplace, particularly among large retailers. This lawsuit could have significant implications for pricing and promotional practices across the consumer goods industry, depending on its outcome.\n\nSource: NBC",

It pledged to reduce its planet-warming air pollution, with benchmarks to meet in 2025 and 2030. However, the company recently announced that it was not on track to reach those targets and would abandon its existing climate pledge timeline, Bloomberg reported.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nOriginally, Walmart promised to reduce its operational production of heat-trapping gases by 65% by the year 2030 and to hit the 35% mark by 2025.\n\nIt is now 2025, and not only is Walmart walking back that promise, but its emissions actually also rose by 4% in 2024 compared to 2023, Bloomberg revealed.\n\n\"We anticipate achieving our near- and mid-term emissions reduction targets later than our 2025 and 2030 target dates,\" the company said in a statement in December, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe company did express an intention to continue trying to reach zero operational pollution by 2040, but it said that the actual possibility of reaching that goal \"depends not only on our own initiatives but also on factors beyond our control.\"\n\nWhy is Walmart's revision of climate goals important?\n\nIn recent years, companies like Walmart have won a lot of consumer approval by making lofty promises to reduce their waste and pollution. This can lead to a boost in business as well as plenty of good press \u2014 but in many cases, it hasn't led to follow-through.\n\nNot only are companies failing to help the planet when they put off or withdraw from climate pledges, but many also see it as deliberate greenwashing meant to mislead consumers by making the brand seem more climate-friendly than it is.\n\nWalmart's history on environmental issues is mixed at best. Although it won accolades for electrifying delivery vehicles and a collaboration to recycle some discarded food into biofuel, it also reached a settlement recently over its improper hazardous waste disposal in California. Shoppers and employees have called out its wasteful practices online.\n\nWhat's being done about Walmart's pledges?\n\nThe company hasn't officially abandoned its 2040 goal, and according to Bloomberg, it will be reevaluating short-term goals this year. It's possible that Walmart will come back to the table with a new, achievable game plan.\n\nHowever, it wouldn't be surprising if many shoppers would want to hold the company accountable for its failure by finding another brand to support.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

Bloomberg reports that the retail giant has partnered with decade-old resale platform Rebag to offer wares from Chanel, Prada, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, and other posh brands, with all items sold under this arrangement certified by Rebag. Rebag CEO Charles Gorra said it's part of his company's efforts to draw more consumers (i.e., richer ones) and to grow its geographic reach. It's also part of Walmart's strategy to stay competitive against other big retailers like Amazon.\n\nModern Retail notes that a catalog of about 27,000 such items became available on Walmart.com as of Thursday, with some products, like Birkin bags, costing into the tens of thousands of dollars. Some third-party sellers had already hawked their luxury offerings at Walmart, but this partnership significantly increases the number. \"A fashion enthusiast might have had their eye on a Saint Laurent bag that was out four or five years ago that they haven't been able to find,\" Walmart exec Michael Mosser says. \"Now, we can bring that to customers as they come and shop with Walmart as really their destination for everything.\"\n\nOver the summer, Walmart also launched Resold at Walmart, which bumped up the number of preowned items it sells across various categories. The retailer has seen 30% sales growth for its third-party marketplace over the last several quarters. Speaking of Birkin bags, Quartz reports that the Walmart-Rebag collaboration came about after the huge success of the \"Wirkin,\" a knockoff of Hermes' famous handbag line. The news outlet also confirms that 100 luxury items in the new catalog will be sold exclusively to Walmart customers. (More Walmart stories.)",

The FTC said that lets Walmart lower its prices, but forces Americans to pay inflated prices for PepsiCo products unless they shop at Walmart.\n\n\u201cWhen firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in the statement. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s action will help ensure all grocers and other businesses \u2014 no matter the size \u2014 can get a fair shake and compete on the merits of their skill, efficiency, and talent.\u201d\n\nWalmart said Friday it had \u201cnothing to add at this time.\u201d PepsiCo said its practices \u201care in line with industry norms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not favor certain customers by offering discounts or promotional support to some customers and not others,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe FTC sued PepsiCo under the rarely enforced 1936 Robinson-Patman Act. The FTC said the act prohibits companies from using promotional incentive payments to favor large customers over smaller ones.\n\nIt was the second time in a little more than a month that the FTC has cited the Robinson-Patman Act in a lawsuit. In December, the commission sued Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits, a large U.S. distributor, saying it illegally discriminated against small and independent businesses by giving discounts and rebates to larger stores.\n\nIn the waning days of the Biden administration, the FTC has been busy issuing consumer refunds, taking enforcement actions against companies the agency accuses of deceptive practices and finalizing rules it says are needed to make the marketplace more fair.\n\nThe FTC voted 3-2 to authorize staff to file a lawsuit for a permanent injunction against PepsiCo in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was one of the two dissenting votes.\n\nThe other commissioner voting against the lawsuit, Melissa Holyoak, wrote in her dissent that the case against PepsiCo was \u201cthe worst case I have seen in my time at the commission.\u201d Holyoak said the majority of commissioners rushed the case out the door before they had enough evidence to support the allegations.\n\n\u201cPepsi\u2019s promotions to the retailer are not disguised discriminatory discounts but rather ordinary price concessions,\u201d Holyoak wrote.\n\nPepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies. It makes Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade as well as snack foods like Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos and Fritos. It also makes Quaker Oats, brekfast cereals and granola bars.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s prices have been the subject of some scrutiny since the pandemic. In 2022, for example, the company acknowledged shrinking its Gatorade bottles from 32 ounces to 28 ounces, but it didn\u2019t respond when asked why it charged more for the 28-ounce bottles.\n\nIn October, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania sent letters to PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and General Mills accusing them of price gouging through shrinking package sizes.\n\nPepsiCo has said its price increases were necessary because of the rising cost of ingredients, shipping, packaging and labor. But over the summer, the company said consumers were pulling back on snack and drink purchases or shifting to cheaper store brands.\n\nPepsiCo responded by trying to make Lay\u2019s more affordable through a mix of product promotions, more chips per bag and value packs. Similar promotions were planned for Doritos and Tostitos, the company said.",

            "content": "Unable to renew a store lease in Newport, Ark., and the desire to reach better hunting areas are two of the many reasons Sam Walton moved his small retail store to downtown Bentonville, and part of the genesis of the city now being home to the world\u2019s largest retailer.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillion noted the history of Bentonville-based Walmart during Friday\u2019s opening of the new 350-acre corporate campus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice to time reflect and it\u2019s a great way to honor Sam and Helen Walton,\u201d McMillon said.\n\nHe said Walmart also didn\u2019t land in Bentonville. Helen and Sam Walton\u2019s first store was in Newport, but when he couldn\u2019t get a lease renewed they looked for property in Siloam Springs and ended up on the square in downtown Bentonville.\n\n\u201cSam loved that he could get from here to hunt in four different states with four different hunting seasons. Soon after he settled in on the Bentonville Square he sought to expand the store and did so. That sounds like a very Sam Walton thing to do,\u201d he added.\n\nWalmart declined to reveal the total estimated cost of the expansive project, except to say it was a multibillion-dollar investment.\n\nMcMillon said the new campus has come a long way from the first conversations he and Board Chairman Greg Penner first had in 2017 about the possibility of a new corporate campus.\n\nMcMillon thanked Penner, the board and the Walton Family for supporting the investment.\n\n\u201cThey did not ask us to go shop other regions for the project and I am very grateful for that. Today is a look at what the future might look like. While we are a 60-plus year company in many ways we are just getting started,\u201d he said.\n\nCindi Marsiglio, senior vice president of real estate at Walmart, opened the event and said it\u2019s been a long seven-plus years but the campus will officially open for business on Jan. 20.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, we have meetings scheduled upstairs and the Spark Shop-Welcome Center is open and we have people already working in the first two office buildings. We have been giving tours of the campus for guests and our associates all day,\u201d she said Friday.\n\nDan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs at Walmart, worked with Marsiglio on the home office project. Bartlett said Walmart sought to include the community in the design because sometimes large corporations wall off their corporate offices. Public streets run through the Walmart campus as do pedestrian and biking trails with retail storefronts on main street areas that are open to the general public.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be everyone\u2019s campus, not (just) those who work at Walmart,\u201d Bartlett said.\n\nTHE TIMELINE SUMMARY\n\nMarsiglio said beginning in 2017 Walmart spent a lot of time obtaining building permits, developing the master plan, and demolishing a lot of property to clear a blank slate for the new campus.\n\nWalmart purchased a tree farm where 5,000 trees were incubated, and 300 existing trees on the campus were retained.\n\nThe campus includes two utility buildings and electric lines were buried. Walmart said there are more than 100 miles of underground wiring and other infrastructure built to support the campus. Walmart also worked with the city and others to move a power substation.\n\nBy early 2022, Walmart accelerated the building of its parking decks, which are prefabricated facades that came up fast. Much of the work in 2022 and 2023 was on the green nature part of the campus which comprises 50% of the 350 acres. In 2024, Walmart opened the fitness center which just celebrated its first anniversary with 750,000 visits during the year. The child care center also opened in 2024 and Marsiglio said it cares for 400 children, which added 15% capacity to the region\u2019s childcare capacity.\n\nShe thanked the Walton Family for funding the fitness center and childcare facility which allowed Walmart to open them sooner.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n\nThe new AC Hotel by Marriott on the campus is still under construction. The hotel, which is located on the Razorback Greenway, will have 153 rooms and a rooftop bar. She expects most of the rooms will be occupied by Walmart people during the week, but the hotel is also open to the public. The hotel is expected to open in the fall.\n\nMarsiglio said Walmart plans to open a building each month with 10 more offices to finish by the end of the year.\n\nThe campus also features two commissioned large water features in the outdoor meeting spaces and along the trails. Sam Walton Hall is situated in the middle of campus and the expansive building showcases one of his planes which is hanging overhead in the foyer.\n\nWalmart will hold its now legendary Saturday morning meetings and other large events in the 1,500-seat auditorium but there is also a 1,500-seat conference center in the building that can be divided into six smaller meeting areas. The Helen Walton amphitheater is located across the street. Walmart built the amphitheater to include elements that harken back to the picnic meetings held on the grounds of the family home for employees in the early years of the company. The public also has access to the amphitheater.\n\nMarsiglio said Walmart is also building a pedestrian walkway across Moberly Lane to connect the David Glass Technology Center with the main campus. The campus extends from 14th Street north to Central Boulevard and J. Street, east to Moberly Lane and Interstate 49. The 8th Street Exit off of I-49 will run through the center of the new campus as a four-lane thoroughfare with sidewalks and a bike path to Walton Boulevard.\n\nBartlett said 8th Street opens again to the public by Saturday morning and should help relieve traffic congestion on the east-to-west streets from the interstate into Bentonville.",

Whether you\u2019re simply trekking past TSA or walking 10,000 steps through a new city, it\u2019s a convenient and secure way to keep your phone, wallet, keys, and other personal belongings directly in reach for you and out of reach for pickpockets.\n\n\n\nAnd while we\u2019ve had our eyes on Madewell\u2019s Essential Sling Bag for a while, we found a nearly identical bag that\u2019s only $10 (compared to $148) and so much more spacious: The No Boundaries Crossbody from Walmart.\n\nNo Boundaries Crossbody Bag\n\nWalmart\n\nWhile the Madewell version is made from a sleek and sophisticated suede material, let\u2019s be realistic. It\u2019s not the most practical material choice for travel. The color easily transfers onto other clothing and can\u2019t get caught in the rain. Walmart\u2019s version, however, comes in several durable and long-lasting variations: cotton, shearling, and polyester.\n\nThe bag itself is also so much more spacious than the Madewell version. It\u2019s flexible and soft, so you can easily pack it away for the flight over without ruining its shape in the process and the flexible strap allows you to adjust it accordingly. You can wear it as a crossbody or shorten it to a shoulder bag. The size also makes it more versatile. It\u2019s much wider than the Madewell version at 12 inches wide x 6.576 inches high x 2.75 inches deep.\n\nHundreds of shoppers praise the bag\u2019s shape, length, and size, saying that it fits all of their essentials with room to spare and is super lightweight and comfortable for all-day wear. One person said it\u2019s perfect for everyday use and traveling, while another added that the style exceeded their expectations and is so durable that you don\u2019t have to worry about regular everyday wear and tear.\n\nHowever, if the crescent-shaped crossbody isn\u2019t exactly your style, Walmart has plenty of other roomy and travel-ready styles that are just as affordable. This Time and Tru design, for example, looks strikingly similar to a Prada style and incredibly functional thanks to the five credit card slots, ID window, interior zipper coin and change pocket, two slip pockets, and a dedicated phone pocket. We also have our eyes on this faux shearling mini that\u2019s primed for travel and this sling bag with tons of hidden compartments.\n\nHead over to Walmart to snag the No Boundaries Crossbody Bag for your next trip, or keep scrolling to shop more of our favorite styles, all under $20.\n\nTime and Tru Call Me Anytime Crossbody Handbag\n\nWalmart\n\nNo Boundaries Bungee Phone Crossbody Bag\n\nWalmart\n\nAthletic Works Crossbody Sling Bag\n\nWalmart\n\nTime and Tru Gia Quilted Crossbody Handbag\n\nWalmart\n\nLove a great deal?

            "content": "Attorney General Anthony G. Brown, along with a coalition of 12 other attorneys general, has expressed serious concerns to Walmart regarding its recent decision to distance itself from previously established diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) commitments. The coalition\u2019s letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon highlights the potential negative impact of discontinuing supplier diversity programs, dismantling the Center for Racial Equality, ending equity trainings, and removing references to \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cDEI\u201d from corporate materials and job titles.\n\nThe move by Walmart comes after the establishment of its Center for Racial Equality in 2020, a response to widespread calls for social justice following the murder of George Floyd. At the time, McMillon emphasized that social justice and equity were integral to Walmart\u2019s core operations.\n\nAttorney General Brown stated, \u201cDiversity, equity, and inclusion policies are essential for preventing discrimination and rectifying historic injustices against marginalized groups. Rolling back these initiatives sends a harmful message to smaller businesses and undermines national efforts toward equality.\u201d\n\nThe coalition criticized efforts by DEI opponents to misuse the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College to unjustifiably pressure organizations against maintaining DEI programs. The attorneys general reaffirmed the legality of DEI initiatives, noting that such programs are not only lawful but also crucial for compliance with civil rights laws.\n\nFurthermore, the coalition emphasized the business advantages of DEI, citing studies linking diverse leadership to better financial performance and consumer preferences for companies that reflect societal diversity. The group includes the attorneys general from California, Connecticut, Hawai\u2019i, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. They collectively urge Walmart to reconsider its decision and continue its support for DEI practices.",

Puskar/Associated Press, File)\n\n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued PepsiCo on Jan. 17, alleging that it has engaged in illegal price discrimination by giving unfair price advantages to one large retailer at the expense of other vendors and consumers.\n\nThe benefiting customer wasn\u2019t named in an FTC statement about the lawsuit. But a source familiar with the case, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss it, said the retailer was Walmart.\n\nPepsiCo said the lawsuit \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law\u201d and misunderstands the way consumer product companies help retailers provide lower prices.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo strongly disputes the FTC\u2019s allegations and the partisan manner in which the suit was filed. We will vigorously present our case in court,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nWalmart and PepsiCo rank Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest private carriers in North America. Walmart passed PepsiCo for the top spot in 2024. PepsiCo had ranked No. 1 since 2010.\n\nThe FTC said PepsiCo\u2019s practices included making promotional payments to Walmart but not to large grocery chains or independent convenience stores. The FTC said that lets Walmart lower its prices but forces Americans to pay inflated prices for PepsiCo products unless they shop at Walmart.\n\nImage Khan\n\n\u201cWhen firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in the statement. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s action will help ensure all grocers and other businesses \u2014 no matter the size \u2014 can get a fair shake and compete on the merits of their skill, efficiency and talent.\u201d\n\nWalmart said Jan. 17 that it had \u201cnothing to add at this time.\u201d PepsiCo said its practices \u201care in line with industry norms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not favor certain customers by offering discounts or promotional support to some customers and not others,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe FTC sued PepsiCo under the rarely enforced 1936 Robinson-Patman Act. The FTC said the act prohibits companies from using promotional incentive payments to favor large customers over smaller ones.\n\nTruck Parking Club's Evan Shelley discusses how innovative platforms are turning available space into opportunities for reserved parking. Tune in above or by going to RoadSigns.ttnews.com.\n\nIt was the second time in a little more than a month that the FTC has cited the Robinson-Patman Act in a lawsuit. In December, the commission sued Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine & Spirits, a large U.S. distributor that ranks No. 49 on the private TT100, saying it illegally discriminated against small and independent businesses by giving discounts and rebates to larger stores.\n\nIn the waning days of the Biden administration, the FTC has been busy issuing consumer refunds, taking enforcement actions against companies the agency accuses of deceptive practices and finalizing rules it says are needed to make the marketplace more fair.\n\nThe FTC voted 3-2 to authorize staff to file a lawsuit for a permanent injunction against PepsiCo in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was one of the two dissenting votes.\n\nThe other commissioner voting against the lawsuit, Melissa Holyoak, wrote in her dissent that the case against PepsiCo was \u201cthe worst case I have seen in my time at the commission.\u201d Holyoak said the majority of commissioners rushed the case out the door before they had enough evidence to support the allegations.\n\n\u201cPepsi\u2019s promotions to the retailer are not disguised discriminatory discounts but rather ordinary price concessions,\u201d Holyoak wrote.\n\nPepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies. It makes Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade as well as snack foods like Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos and Fritos. It also makes Quaker Oats, breakfast cereals and granola bars.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s prices have been the subject of some scrutiny since the pandemic. In 2022, for example, the company acknowledged shrinking its Gatorade bottles from 32 ounces to 28 ounces, but it didn\u2019t respond when asked why it charged more for the 28-ounce bottles.\n\nIn October, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania sent letters to PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and General Mills accusing them of price gouging through shrinking package sizes.\n\nPepsiCo has said its price increases were necessary because of the rising cost of ingredients, shipping, packaging and labor. But over the summer, the company said consumers were pulling back on snack and drink purchases or shifting to cheaper store brands.",

More than 15,000 corporate employees will work at the new headquarters when it opens in phases throughout this year.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon first shared his vision for a new corporate campus in September 2017 and work began on the multi-year project in 2019. In mid-2020 the retailer took time to re-think the project amid the global pandemic that prompted the remote work reality.\n\nSince 2021, the expansive and expensive project has been a flurry of activity. Walmart said the campus establishes a new standard for corporate headquarters that prioritizes worker well-being, environmental stewardship and public accessibility. Walmart said employee feedback and innovative design helped create the new workplace.\n\n\u201cOur new Home Office honors our heritage and the contributions that generations of associates have made to help people save and have a better life. Our founder, Sam Walton, knew that when we all work together, ideas flourish, and this campus will allow us to keep making a positive difference in our customers\u2019 lives for generations to come,\u201d McMillon said.\n\nCindi Marsiglio, senior vice president of real estate at Walmart, who oversaw the massive, multi-year project, said Walmart employees have managed more than 8 million project hours to date, and are expected to reach 10 million by the time the campus is fully complete,\n\n\u201cToday marks a moment I\u2019ve been dreaming about for years. After lots of planning, groundbreaking ceremonies and hard hat tours, we\u2019re celebrating the opening of our New Home Office campus in Bentonville. And wow, what a place it is. Countless people poured their hearts into this project to create something extraordinary for our associates and our community,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe campus includes a welcome center for visitors and employees, and the Helen\u2019s Amphitheater named after Walmart co-founder Helen Robson Walton that has terraced seating and a tree-canopied lawn for campus and community gatherings. The first two of 12 office spaces are dubbed Cheer and Ol\u2019Roy to note the company\u2019s culture and history. The retailer\u2019s fashion division is in the Cheer building, and the pets and outdoor divisions are in the Ol\u2019Roy building. Each of the office buildings will be named after some Walmart legend or tradition.\n\nThe 8th & Plate food hall will have seven coffee shops, food truck pavilions, grab-and-go markets, a rooftop lounge and street-front retail and restaurants. The street front retail will include Bentonville Bicycle Company, Flyway Brewing, Gearhead Outfitters, The Gents Place, Hatch Early Mood Food, Jamba Juice, Reserve Bar + Tapas, Swig, Walmart Pharmacy, Wrights BBQ and Yokozuna Sushi. Walmart said the street front retail will be available in the spring.\n\nAlso on campus is a 360,000-square-foot Walton Family Whole Health & Fitness Center on campus and onsite childcare \u2013 Little Squiggles Children\u2019s of Enrichment Center \u2013 which opened in 2024.\n\nThe retailer also integrated more than 750,000 native plants, including 5,000 planted trees on campus. Walmart said 50% of the total acreage is devoted to green space. There will be shaded walkways and seven miles of bike and pedestrian trails that connect to a rentable bike fleet. There will be more than 1,000 bike parking spots and 300 EV charging stations for employees and visitors.\n\nWalmart is using smart technology systems including enhanced mobile applications, drone exterior window washing, autonomous mowing and vacuums, and smart room booking systems.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the first of two stories about the new campus.

Fallon (Getty Images)\n\nWalmart (WMT) is making a big push into the luxury market and has tapped resale platform Rebag to attract wealthier shoppers.\n\nStarting Jan. 16, the retail giant will offer over 27,000 pre-owned, high-end items on its online marketplace, including coveted pieces from brands like Chanel, Fendi (LVMUY), Prada (PRDSY), and Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe move follows the viral success of the \u201cWirkin,\u201d a dupe of the famous Herm\u00e8s (HESAY) Birkin bag, and marks a significant step in Walmart\u2019s resale business. By offering luxury goods at accessible prices, Walmart aims to broaden its appeal to high-income shoppers who have been driving recent sales growth.\n\nRebag\u2019s catalog will include luxury handbags, watches, jewelry, and accessories \u2013 ranging from smaller items to iconic pieces like the Birkin bag, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Additionally, there will be 100 items sold exclusively to Walmart customers, the company confirmed to Quartz in an email.\n\nThe partnership could help Walmart tap into a fashion-forward, price-conscious consumer, and one that\u2019s looking for premium items at discount. The exclusive collection is designed to offer access to hard-to-find pieces that many shoppers may not expect to find at Walmart.\n\nThe collab also plays into Walmart\u2019s sustainability goals, as it increases the number of pre-owned items on the platform. This follows the 2024 launch of \u201cResold at Walmart,\u201d a dedicated section for secondhand goods.\n\nWalmart has been growing its third-party marketplace aggressively, with sales increasing 30% year-over-year. That could help it compete with e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN), especially with the surge in online shopping. Walmart may have to play catch up. Amazon already features a luxury goods section called \u201cThe Shop,\u201d which is operated by online retailer Shopbop.\n\nBy expanding into luxury resale, Walmart may further boost site traffic, attract new customers, and strengthen its position the fiercely competitive e-commerce landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart is facing investor backlash over its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Over 30 shareholders sent a letter to CEO Doug McMillion earlier this week, accusing the company of bowing to anti-DEI groups.\n\nThe group, primarily composed of faith- and values-focused investors, called the pull back \u201cvery disheartening.\u201d They\u2019re demanding answers and want to meet with the company\u2019s senior leadership and board to discuss the shift in policy. Shareholders \u2013 including organizations like Amalgamated Bank (AMAL) and United Church Funds \u2013 have raised concerns about the risks of discrimination and inequities for over 30 years.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

            "content": "Walmart is adding tens of thousands of pre-owned luxury handbags, jewelry and watches to its marketplace through a partnership with resale platform Rebag, which allows users to buy, sell and trade such items.\n\nBeginning Jan. 16, Rebag will sell its full catalog of about 27,000 items on Walmart.com, including products from brands such as Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s, Chanel, Gucci, Christian Dior, Saint Laurent, Fendi, Prada, Bottega Veneta and Goyard, Walmart and Rebag executives told Modern Retail. Rebag\u2019s catalog ranges from smaller accessories to Birkin bags that can cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nWalmart already offered some used luxury items through third-party sellers, but the Rebag partnership increases that selection ten fold and coincides with the launch of a new section of Walmart\u2019s website centered on luxury resale. Rebag also worked with the merchandising team at Walmart to use internal search and sell-through data to curate an exclusive collection of 100 additional items specifically for Walmart shoppers.\n\n\u201cA fashion enthusiast might have had their eye on a Saint Laurent bag that was out four or five years ago that they haven\u2019t been able to find,\u201d Michael Mosser, vp of Marketplace for Walmart, said in an interview with Modern Retail. \u201cAnd now, we can bring that to customers as they come and shop with Walmart as really their destination for everything.\u201d\n\nFor Walmart, the goal is to add higher-profile, in-demand brands to its website that its customers are searching for but don\u2019t expect to find with the retailer. That, in turn, can boost site traffic and advertising revenue. Walmart similarly expanded its assortment in September through a partnership with sneaker marketplace StockX, which added more high-demand shoes, such as Nike\u2019s Air Jordans, to the platform.\n\nIn addition to adding more luxury items, this also increases the number of pre-owned items on the marketplace. Mosser said selling pre-owned products aligns with Walmart\u2019s sustainability commitments, provides access to brands customers wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to purchase and attracts fashion or collectible enthusiasts to Walmart.com. In August, the retailer launched Resold at Walmart, which expanded its selection of pre-owned items across many different categories.\n\nWalmart said efforts to introduce customers to more categories and brands have led to more than 30% sales growth for the third-party marketplace in each of the past five quarters. \u201cThis ability that we have with an endless aisle, to bring a full breadth of assortment, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re bringing to customers through the marketplace business overall,\u201d Mosser said.\n\nWalmart\u2019s marketplace and digital offerings have been seen as a way for the retailer to better compete with Amazon while thriving in areas like grocery Amazon has yet to dominate. Amazon has made some attempts in the luxury space through the years. It launched a section of its site for the category in 2020 but seemed to struggle to win over major luxury brands, with counterfeit items being a central concern for would-be sellers and brands.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Walmart reported that households making more than $100,000 made up 75% of its gains in market share. Andrew Lipsman, an independent media analyst at Media, Ads + Commerce, said an expanded luxury selection could help Walmart drive its bottom line not only by attracting higher-income shoppers but also by bringing valuable luxury goods advertisers into its Walmart Connect advertising ecosystem. \u201cAs Walmart Connect makes bigger moves into streaming TV and other upper-funnel formats, these advertisers only become more valuable,\u201d he said.\n\nElizabeth Layne, Rebag\u2019s chief marketing officer, said her company watched Walmart expand its selection, such as its StockX partnership and saw an opportunity to reach a wider audience.\n\n\u201cThis is a great way for us to really access this mass market and really bring luxury resale to a much wider audience than we\u2019ve ever done before,\u201d Layne said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the reach and building awareness for us.\u201d\n\nRebag got its start in 2014 as a website and has since opened stores in New York, California and Florida. It also has a partnership that includes an in-store presence at five Bloomingdale\u2019s locations. The company also launched a membership program last year, Rebag+, that provided members with 5% discounts off all items on the site as well as other benefits such as free shipping and returns. In 2023, Rebag launched consignment as an additional sales method that aims to offer higher payouts.\n\nOver the past year or two, Rebag has been more focused on partnerships, Layne said. Last August, it partnered with Bloomingdale\u2019s, adding more than 2,500 luxury items to the retailer\u2019s website. Unlike the new Walmart partnership, Rebag also offered some of the products and facilitated sales at select stores.\n\n\u201cWe find luxury resale as a way for the consumer to have more accessibility into the luxury market,\u201d Layne said. \u201cWalmart\u2019s a way for us to reach that sort of wider audience and introduce this luxury product to them.\u201d",

(Nasdaq: SYM), a leader in A.I.-enabled robotics technology for the supply chain, today announced it has agreed to acquire the Advanced Systems and Robotics business from Walmart (NYSE: WMT). This transaction expands the long-standing relationship between Walmart and Symbotic with the aim of developing an integrated automated supply chain.\n\nWalmart has chosen Symbotic to develop, build and deploy an advanced solution leveraging Symbotic\u2019s A.I.-enabled robotics platform to offer Walmart customers greater shopping convenience through accelerated online pickup and delivery options at stores. Symbotic will engage in a development program funded by Walmart to enhance current online pickup and delivery fulfillment systems as well as to design new systems to meet the needs of current and future customers. If performance criteria are achieved, Walmart is committed to purchasing and deploying systems for 400 APDs at stores over a multi-year period, with Walmart\u2019s option to add additional APDs in the coming years. Associated with the development program, Walmart will pay Symbotic a total of $520 million , including $230 million at closing.\n\nThe transaction and new agreements could increase Symbotic\u2019s future backlog by more than $5 billion and adds a micro-fulfillment solution that expands its addressable market by more than $300 billion in the United States alone.\n\nTotal consideration for the acquisition is $200 million in cash at close, subject to customary adjustments, and up to $350 million in additional contingent consideration in future periods dependent upon the quantity of APD systems ordered.\n\n\u201cThis is a highly strategic transaction for Symbotic as we expand upon our long-term relationship with Walmart and broaden our product offering beyond the traditional warehouse to eCommerce settings for last mile delivery,\u201d said Rick Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Symbotic.\n\nSymbotic has played a critical role in enabling Walmart to automate its vast supply chain since 2017 and is currently deploying its software and robotics platform across all 42 of Walmart\u2019s regional distribution centers in the U.S. Bringing Symbotic\u2019s expertise and technology platform to the APD is a natural extension of this work and allows Walmart to utilize its stores to fulfill eCommerce orders through pickup and delivery more efficiently, economically, and accurately. Approximately 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of Walmart\u2019s more than 4,600 stores. Walmart\u2019s store-fulfilled deliveries grew nearly 50% year-over-year, surpassing a $2.5 billion monthly run rate, during its quarter ended October 31, 2024.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about what this means for our customers. We anticipate the synergy between Symbotic\u2019s expertise and our nearly decade-long relationship in innovating the supply chain technologies to elevate customer service and rapidly advance our in-store Accelerated Pickup and Delivery capabilities,\u201d said Greg Cathey, Senior Vice President of Transformation and Innovation at Walmart.\n\nThe acquisition is anticipated to close in Symbotic\u2019s fiscal second quarter of 2025.\n\nCiti served as financial advisor to Symbotic.\n\nWEBCAST INFORMATION\n\nSymbotic will host a webcast today at 8 a.m. ET to discuss the acquisition of Walmart\u2019s Advanced Systems and Robotics business. The webcast link is: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/rjiibzn9.\n\nABOUT SYMBOTIC\n\nSymbotic is an automation technology leader reimagining the supply chain with its end-to-end, A.I.-powered robotic and software platform.

            "content": "\u201cFrom both a moral and a financial perspective, it is extremely disappointing to see Walmart roll back its commitment to advancing DEI within its workforce and operations,\u201d said Caroline Boden, director of shareholder advocacy at St. Louis-based Mercy Investment Services, principal author of the letter and one of its 31 signatories. \u201cDEI initiatives aren\u2019t just \u2018nice to have\u2019, they are essential to breaking down the systemic inequities hindering our economy and preventing society from fully thriving. Inequity is bad for business and, ultimately, investors.\u201d\n\nAccording to the shareholders' letter: \u201cWalmart has sent a clear signal to all underrepresented and marginalized groups that Walmart will not fight to protect their rights. In a time when there are threats to the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, threats of mass deportation of migrants, in addition to potential policies that may disproportionately harm people and workers of color, who make up over half of Walmart\u2019s workforce, and low-income communities, it is imperative for Walmart to remain committed to its stated values of fostering a sense of belonging for everyone.\u201d\n\nWalmart isn\u2019t alone in backtracking on its DEI programs. Other brands scaling down or dropping their DEI efforts include Meta, Amazon, Molson Coors, Tractor Supply, Caterpillar, John Deere, Lowe\u2019s, Ford, Toyota and Harley-Davidson.\n\nHowever, some companies aren\u2019t bowing to the anti-DEI pressure, which has generally come from conservative activists. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp. is pushing back against National Center for Public Policy Research\u2019s criticism against its DEI roles, policies and goals. The club retailer believes that its DEI efforts enhance its capacity to attract and retain employees who will inevitably help its business succeed. Apple is also continuing to back its diversity policies.\n\nRev. Seamus Finn, of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, another signatory of the Walmart shareholders' letter, said that Walmart\u2019s power and influence can\u2019t be overstated when it comes to this issue. \u201cAs the largest private employer in the U.S., with an enormous list of suppliers worldwide, Walmart\u2019s actions on so many issues of societal importance will be widely scrutinized and emulated by other companies for years to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is well documented that robust DEI policies make for stronger companies by fostering more creative boards and more resilient workforces and supply chains. We will ask CEO McMillon and the Walmart board how they wish to be remembered: as a principled voice of moral and ethical business practices and an upholder of civil rights, or the cowed voice of submission and complicity with bullies dealing in intolerance and hate.\u201d\n\nEach week, approximately 255 million customers and members visit Walmart\u2019s more than 10,500 stores and numerous e-commerce websites in 19 countries. With fiscal year 2024 revenue of $648 billion, the retailer employs approximately 2.1 million associates worldwide. Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart U.S. is No. 1 on Progressive Grocer\u2019s 2024 list of the top food and consumables retailers in North America. Issaquah, Wash.-based Costco operates approximately 900 warehouses, including 600-plus in the United States and Puerto Rico,100-plus in Canada, and 41 in Mexico. The company is No. 3 on The PG 100. Both Walmart and Costco were named among PG\u2019s Retailers of the Century.",

But a 72% gain over the course of just one calendar year? Many of the market's most attractive growth stocks didn't even fare that well in 2024.\n\nWhat did the retailer do so differently? Not much, actually. The backdrop just changed, forcing investors to finally recognize how durable this company's been all along.\n\nPlaying right into Walmart's hand\n\nTo fully understand why Walmart stock did so wall last year, one must go all the way back to 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing then, working in the retailer's favor. But by 2021, red flags were waving. Like so many other retailers, this one loaded up on too much inventory in anticipation of a spending rebound that was muted by inflation that ended up lingering far longer than expected. That's why even by mid-2023, Walmart stock was no higher than it was as of late 2020.\n\nThen circumstances changed. In the midst of these inflation-driven headwinds, Walmart's value offering and wide selection eventually made it a go-to shopping option for almost everyone. The retailer's 2023 U.S. same-store sales were up 6.6%, and the growth persisted into calendar 2024. Comparable retailers including Target or Dollar General couldn't match that strength. Indeed, several times since then, Walmart's touted how most of its market share gains have come from households earning in excess of $100,000, a demographic that wasn't exactly the store chain's core customer in the past.\n\nThe thing is, these more affluent customers seem to be sticking around, responding to the retailer's efforts to keep them coming back. These measures include perks such as free shipping for Walmart+ members on many of their purchases, but also overhauls of its stores that make them look more like a higher-end department store and less like a warehouse.\n\nInvestors are simply responding to the traction Walmart is getting.\n\nThat said, a two-and-a-half-year hiatus from any forward progress also left the stock primed for an oversized rally.\n\nRight stock, wrong time\n\nBut does this rally have a future? Probably not without having a sizable setback materialize first.\n\nDon't misunderstand. This is probably the new norm for Walmart's business. The coming year's projected sales growth of a little over 4% is healthy against the backdrop of tamed inflation. This growth rate is expected to be matched next year, too. CEO Doug McMillon certainly appears to have his finger on the precise pulse of the consumer market right now. Analysts like the stock, too, with the vast majority of them rating it a strong buy.\n\nNow up more than 80% from its late-2023 low, though, there's simply too much near-term profit-taking potential to tangle with the stock just yet. At least let the dust settle a bit first before venturing into this otherwise attractive prospect.",

            "content": "As of today, Jan. 15, Walmart has doubled down on its push into the metaverse by launching Zepeto\u2019s first-ever e-commerce experience for physical goods.\n\nZepeto is a digital avatar creation platform that allows its user base \u2014 which skews female and is roughly 70 percent Gen-Z, per Walmart and Zepeto \u2014 to create and share virtual experiences using digital representations of themselves. Now, Zepeto app users viewing virtual Walmart clothing items can use the app to log into their Walmart accounts and order physical versions of those items to be shipped directly to their doorsteps. Additionally, purchases of select physical garments in brick-and-mortar Walmart stores will also come with free downloads of their virtual equivalents on Zepeto.\n\nThe launch is Walmart\u2019s third metaverse e-commerce experience, evidence that the retailer is playing the long game in its approach to virtual worlds. In April 2024, Walmart partnered with Roblox to open that platform\u2019s first e-commerce experience for physical goods; in May 2024, Walmart opened its own virtual world platform featuring e-commerce opportunities, Walmart Realm.\n\nIntroducing e-commerce\n\nAlthough Zepeto is smaller than the \u201cbig three\u201d metaverse platforms of Roblox, Fortnite and Minecraft, it is a significant player in the virtual world game, boasting 20 million monthly active users, according to numbers shared by Zepeto and Walmart.\n\n\u201cThe reason why Zepeto as a platform is so interesting compared with the other UGC [user-generated content] gaming platforms like Roblox and UEFN [Unreal Editor for Fortnite] is that image \u2014 including clothing, accessories, make up, et cetera \u2014 plays a bigger role in the players\u2019 lives on-platform,\u201d said Morgan Evans, the director of fashion and beauty for metaverse studio Karta.\n\nWalmart has maintained an official partnership with Zepeto since last year, although company reps declined to share the specific terms of the agreement, such as how the companies will be sharing revenue from product sales. Beginning on Oct. 24, 2024, Zepeto users have been able to make their avatars try on virtual recreations of garments from Walmart\u2019s No Boundaries brand, with a second item drop occurring last November. Today\u2019s launch of e-commerce for physical goods also comes with an additional drop of 10 new clothing items.\n\nSince the October launch, Zepeto users have tried on virtual Walmart items over 3.5 million times, according to figures shared by Walmart, 1.3 million purchases of virtual garments have been made and 1.87 million pieces of Zepeto content have been created using No Boundaries items. The company declined to say how many individual people had tried on or purchased the virtual Walmart items, but these numbers helped encourage Walmart to implement e-commerce into the experience.\n\n\u201cThe upside of this is much stronger than any sort of risk, at this point, especially for a company as well-backed as Walmart,\u201d said Jason Chung, director of esports and gaming at New York University. \u201cAs for Zepeto, they should have been doing this anyway \u2014 for a retailer, what\u2019s the point of having any sort of avatar or interactive experience without an opportunity to directly buy off the platform?\u201d\n\nGathering user data\n\nThe ability to gather concrete data about users\u2019 preferences toward specific clothing items was one reason why Walmart decided to launch its latest virtual e-commerce experience on Zepeto rather than a rival metaverse platform, per Walmart head of brand marketing innovation Justin Breton. By working with Zepeto, Walmart is able to determine which clothing items are tried on most often, as well as which items are most often featured in user-generated Zepeto content. Through the October and November drops, for example, Walmart learned that virtual items displaying graphic designs or phrases performed better than traditional items such as unmarked sweaters or jeans.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s great about Zepeto is that it\u2019s actually giving us data and insights around that next generation of consumer that are actually applicable to platforms like Roblox and Minecraft and Fortnite, because of that notion that this next generation is using their virtual persona to make real-world purchases,\u201d Breton said.\n\nZepeto\u2019s Walmart e-commerce integration is currently live and will remain open indefinitely, with a Walmart rep telling Digiday that the company \u201cwill assess customer feedback and look to learn as much as we can before making any future decisions\u201d regarding its Zepeto presence. The integration comes in the form of a virtual Walmart storefront accessible directly within the Zepeto app. Users viewing a virtual item inside Zepeto can click on a button to purchase a real-life version through a Walmart storefront embedded within the app, with a fulfillment process identical to that of any other online Walmart order.\n\n\u201cWhat that allows for is the customer or the user to feel safe and secure, because there is actually no new payment information being recorded,\u201d Breton said. \u201cIt\u2019s all being pulled directly from your Walmart account.\u201d\n\nWalmart\u2019s decision to focus on virtual clothing items for its latest foray into the metaverse shows how the company has learned from its previous experiments in the space. In 2022, online observers clowned on the company for its Walmartland Roblox experience, which some users believed was devoid of meaningful content. And last year\u2019s Roblox e-commerce launch, though innovative, focused on items such as water bottles and bags rather than virtual clothing. In contrast, Walmart\u2019s Zepeto experience takes advantage of the virtual identity experimentation that drives users to the platform in the first place, giving users ample opportunities to alter their virtual appearance using No Boundaries items.\n\n\u201cOn Zepeto, particularly when it comes to clothing and fashion, there\u2019s a much higher propensity to spend on digital goods,\u201d said Barney Lynch, an account director for data company GEEIQ, which has worked with Walmart and Zepeto to provide insights on both today\u2019s launch and the companies\u2019 past metaverse activations. \u201cAnd the hope of the thing, that we\u2019re really excited to learn, is whether that is also the case for physical goods.\u201d",

            "content": "While Walmart has downsized its global portfolio, the retail giant continues to invest in countries where it sees growth opportunities. The company recently said it will invest $1.3 billion in Chile over the next five years. After exiting Argentina and Brazil, Chile remains the retailer\u2019s sole asset in South America.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon has said divestitures in Argentina and Brazil were hard decisions, but more oxygen was breathed into remaining businesses. Walmart said remaining in Chile allows for consolidation of market leadership in one of the region\u2019s most stable economies. Walmart Chile CEO Cristian Barrientos said the investment is in infrastructure, technology, people and community.\n\n\u201cWe are building a better future for everyone, for future generations and for our children. We trust in Chile. We trust in its people. We continue exploring together,\u201d Barrientos said.\n\nThe expansion includes 70 new stores in underserved regions, which will extend Walmart\u2019s reach into areas that have traditionally been difficult to reach. The expansion will add 4,000 new jobs, reinforcing Walmart\u2019s position as a key employer in the country.\n\nA new distribution center will be built in southern Chile to service the region. This facility will allow for faster restocking and improved service in urban and rural areas, according to the retailer. Barrientos said complexity of the climate means accessing the southern tip of Chile is not an easy task. The Walmart Lider store in Punta Arenas is more than 2,000 miles from the central distribution center. Also, the weather can be extreme. In 2024, the area saw temperatures reaching minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWalmart said it reacted by creating supply chain routes by land, air, and sea or a combination of routes to reach the southernmost Lider store. When access becomes too treacherous, Walmart uses a reserve storage system called \u201cEl Oso\u201d \u2014 the bear \u2014 to ensure customers can still get the essentials. The Punta Arenas team also created an e-commerce strategy to deliver products via ferry to the 25 residents of Puerto Toro, the southernmost permanently inhabited community on Earth.\n\n\u201cStories like these are what drive us,\u201d said Barrientos. \u201cFor this reason, the impact of Walmart Chile is not only in Punta Arenas; our value proposition aims to reach every corner of Chile: from Putre in the far north to Biob\u00edo in the central south. And to so many other places whose inhabitants motivate us to continue seeking new ways to approach, listen to, and serve them \u2026 to become their best ally and neighbor.\u201d\n\nWalmart also said it is focusing on sustainability, with plans to install solar panels at more than 50 locations in keeping with Walmart Chile\u2019s goal to source more than 80% of its energy from renewable sources. The plan also calls for 25 new recycling points this year to promote waste reduction.\n\n\u201cThis announcement allows us to further enhance our value proposition to customers through low prices on basic products, as well as products and solutions that improve their quality of life,\u201d said Kath McLay, CEO of Walmart International.\n\nWALMART HISTORY IN CHILE\n\nWalmart entered Chile in 2009 with a $1.6 billion majority acquisition of Distribuci\u00f3n y Servicio, one of the country\u2019s leading retailers. The Walmart-owned stores in Chile include Lider, Express de Lider, SuperBodega aCuenta and Central Mayorista which number nearly 400 stores making it a large retailer in the country.\n\nWalmart first invested in South America in 1995, with four Walmart stores and two Sam\u2019s Clubs in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Global tensions and economic instability prompted the sale in 2020 of Walmart and Changomas banners in Argentina to Group de Narvaez, keeping only a small minority stake. Brazil was another market where Walmart struggled to operate from 1995 until 80% of that business was sold in 2018. Walmart was unable to grow market share amid local competition and French retail giant Carrefour. By 2022, Walmart was completely out of Brazil when Carrefour acquired Walmart\u2019s minority stake in Brazil businesses.\n\nChile has a population of more than 18 million, a growing middle class and a stable economic environment that the other countries did not possess. Analysts also said the country\u2019s high internet penetration and expanding e-commerce business provide additional opportunities for Walmart to integrate online and physical store shopping experiences. By 2022, Walmart Chile was the largest supermarket in Chile by revenue, with a market share of about 20% of total retail in the country.\n\nWhile there have been challenges in Chile from local and international retailers, Walmart said it has been able to adapt and leverage its global supply chain to focus on local consumer needs. Walmart said Chile also serves as a strategic hub for its operations in Latin America, enabling the company to experiment with innovation that can be replicated in other markets.\n\nThis latest investment follows news in late 2023 of Walmart expanding its online marketplace to Chile in 2024, joining Canada, the United States and Mexico. The expansion allows U.S. sellers to reach a broader audience and sell products globally. Chile offers a market for e-commerce for U.S. sellers because a free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Chile allows for smoother international transactions. For Chilean sellers the country has free trade agreements with China and the European Union in addition to the U.S.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers.

However, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company documented its strategy as it debuted its new visual assets on Jan. 13.\n\n\ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff \ufeff\n\nWalmart web sales by year\n\nWalmart is No. 2 in the Top 1000 , Digital Commerce 360\u2019s ranking of North America\u2019s online retailers by web sales. It is also No. 9 in the Global Online Marketplaces Database , Digital Commerce 360\u2019s ranking of top such marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV). Digital Commerce 360 projects Walmart\u2019s online sales in 2025 will reach $153.88 billion.\n\nWhat did Walmart change in its latest brand refresh?\n\nWalmart focused on three major updates included in its 2025 brand refresh.\n\nThe first is its wordmark, which features a custom font. The wordmark traces its inspiration back to a trucker hat worn by Walmart founder Sam Walton. Second, the shapes and colors used in Walmart\u2019s recognizable yellow-on-blue logo, which it refers to as its \u201cspark,\u201d have been changed. Third, the overall color palette, which Walmart calls \u201cTrue Blue and Spark Yellow,\u201d will introduce those hues together in a variety of contexts.\n\nUltimately, Walmart intends for the new brand guidelines to convey a modern identity and omnichannel capabilities to shoppers.\n\n\u201cWalmart aims to be an inspirational, digital retailer that provides all the products, brands and services our customers need and want,\u201d said William White, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Walmart U.S. \u201cThis update, rooted in the legacy of our founder, Sam Walton, demonstrates our evolving capabilities and longstanding commitment to serve our customers of today and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhy Walmart updated its brand identity\n\n\u201cWhile the look and feel of our brand is more contemporary, our refreshed brand identity reflects Walmart\u2019s enduring commitment to both Sam\u2019s principles and serving our customers however they need us,\u201d White explained. \u201cAs our customers evolve, we will too. Our Walmart will always be their Walmart, and our brand will always be a testament to how we innovate and change alongside them.\u201d\n\nIn its announcement, Walmart listed goals such as improving \u201ccredibility and connection\u201d and becoming \u201cknown for its convenient digital-first services.\u201d It addition, it hopes to be \u201cseen as a more modern, culturally dynamic brand.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Walmart spark?\n\nWalmart\u2019s spark logo, which can already be seen on Walmart stores and in digital contexts, first debuted in 2008. The 2025 brand refresh changed the spark\u2019s look. The new treatment gives the logo what Walmart refers to as \u201corganic curves that feel approachable and less rigid.\u201d\n\nThough it will most often appear against the standard \u201cTrue Blue\u201d and white backgrounds, the company also allows for it to be shown against a darker shade of blue, which is called Bentonville Blue.\n\nThe new branding first showed up publicly in October 2024 at Walmart\u2019s Store 4108 in Springdale, Arkansas, the retailer noted. Walmart\u2019s website, app and other stores have begun adopting the new look as well.

Milk, eggs, everything is going up,\" says Cicely Gardner, rolling a cart with some doughnuts in the parking lot.\n\nBut wait. The rate of inflation has cooled for two years, and not everything is going up in price. So why does paying at checkout still cause such heartburn? What gives?\n\nNPR set off to answer that question at the most popular retailer in the United States. For six years, we have tracked the prices of dozens of items at this very Walmart superstore. And here's what we learned on our latest visit, in December. (Or skip the analysis to see the full details of NPR's shopping cart.)\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOn average, prices ticked up 0.7% last year\n\nNPR's list includes 96 items from virtually every Walmart aisle: chips and veggies, shampoo and T-shirts, dog food and paper towels. To account for changes in package sizes, we focus on the price per unit, typically per ounce, whether it's toothpaste in a tube or soup in a can.\n\nOver the course of 2024, the tracked prices on average increased just 0.7% \u2014 far less than overall annual inflation, which was 2.7% in November. (December's inflation data will be released on Wednesday.)\n\nThat's because exactly half of our tracked prices stayed the same from December 2023 to December 2024 \u2014 a notable relief after the COVID-19 pandemic, when most prices jumped year to year because of turmoil in supply chains and labor markets.\n\nLoading...\n\nTwenty-one items in NPR's shopping cart actually got cheaper during the year, including garlic, bananas and salmon. Another 27 products got more expensive, including eggs, ground beef and laundry detergent.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe five-year view is much more painful\n\nItems in NPR's shopping cart are much pricier since mid-2019, our last check before the pandemic. On average, those tracked prices have increased around 25%. And that's not far from federal inflation data: Cumulatively, U.S. prices are up 23% since 2019.\n\nFor example, a 4-pound bag of Domino sugar now costs $4.46. That's 74% more compared with NPR's visit to Walmart in 2019. A dozen eggs cost $4.90, or 83% more than they cost five years ago. Tide liquid laundry detergent now comes in a smaller container \u2014 84 ounces instead of 100 ounces \u2014 but costs $1 more, in a classic case of shrinkflation. Regular family grocery runs add up.\n\nLoading...\n\nBack in 2019, NPR's visit to this suburban Walmart, near a large Army base, focused on the impact of then-President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Our shopping cart was smaller, filled with many products either imported or made with imported parts. Only a few of those items have now gotten cheaper, including frozen shrimp, swai fish and \u2014 most dramatically \u2014 screwdrivers. (Walmart has switched brands, and the price is now 60% lower than it was.)\n\n\n\n2019 prices will stay in the past\n\nBig price increases are rarely followed by equally big price decreases, historically. That's because seismic shifts in the global economy cannot simply be undone.\n\nFor example, it still costs more than it did in 2019 to ship things across the world. It costs more to fertilize soil where our food grows, because Russia is one of the biggest exporters of fertilizer. Prices have grown for paper and corrugated cardboard used in packaging. President Biden has largely kept Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which means U.S. companies are paying higher import fees \u2014 and passing some of that cost on to shoppers.\n\nStores, factories, farms and warehouses are paying more for utilities and insurance. Gas prices affect the cost of trucking. American wages, on average, have outpaced inflation for more than a year and a half, with some wage increases affecting the cost of making, packing, selling and delivering our purchases.\n\nSome items \u2014 like eggs, beef, chocolate and coffee \u2014 have faced specific troubles. Cases of avian flu have continued in chickens and cows. Dairy and cattle farmers also point to droughts increasing the cost of feed. Extreme weather has damaged harvests of coffee and cocoa, leading to record wholesale prices.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nHere's what Walmart and manufacturers had to say\n\nNPR asked the companies that make the items in our shopping cart to explain their price increases. Some didn't respond, including PepsiCo's Frito-Lay, Eggland's Best and Unilever, which makes Dove, Degree and Vaseline. And from those that did reply, we heard a common refrain: It simply costs more to make stuff.\n\nThe maker of Domino sugar, ASR Group, sent a detailed list of price increases it has faced since the start of the pandemic: general freight trucking costs up 19%, deep-sea shipping up 45%, rail-freight shipping 17%, wages 15%.\n\nGeneral Mills, whose Yoplait yogurt cup is 17 cents (or 28%) pricier than it was in mid-2019, said dairy inflation is worse than general inflation.\n\nA 16-ounce jar of Jif peanut butter is 90 cents (or 41%) more than it was in mid-2019; its maker, J.M. Smucker, said shelled peanut prices rose about 44%.\n\nWelch's, whose grape jelly went up almost 68% since mid-2019, said many farmers in its cooperative went into the pandemic already financially struggling, prompting the company to \"increase returns to growers\" to sustain those family farms.\n\nMany brands also said Walmart is the final arbiter of prices on its shelves.\n\nWalmart does have the power to sell some popular items at break-even prices or even below cost, making up for the lost profits by charging a bit more for other products. But overall, supermarket prices are a complex amalgam of both the expenses and markups of manufacturers, wholesalers and the retailer as they respond to a myriad of factors, including harvests, seasons and shoppers' loyalties.\n\nWalmart, as the largest U.S. retailer, tends to extract lowest-priced deals from suppliers. In November, Walmart's CEO said the chain had lowered prices on 6,000 items, half of which were groceries. Walmart's scale also enables it to keep prices as stable as possible, which was a key reason NPR chose the chain for this project.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"We are committed to providing an Every Day Low Price experience both in stores and online,\" a Walmart representative said in a written statement to NPR, \"with the goal of having the lowest price on a basket of goods over time.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nResearch and analysis by Alina Selyukh/NPR.

            "content": "It wasn\u2019t until I started working retail when I was in my late teens that I realized that older people aren\u2019t as patient as I thought they were. Until then, I had only been around gentle, patient, and selfless older folks, I guess. Or maybe I never noticed.\n\nOut in the vestibule at Walmart, the crowd would line up ready for the doors to open on Saturday morning. Invariably, one of the guys going to fetch carts would come out the side door and some older guy would yell \u201cAre you open?\u201d This could happen 30-45 minutes before the actual opening time.\n\nOnce the doors were open, the stampede \u2013 albeit slower than most stampedes \u2013 would begin. There would be at least one or two folks coming up to me (I worked at the service desk) who would say \u201cWhere have you moved the paper towels?\u201d or \u201cWhy is that shelf of such-and-such empty?\u201d\n\nOne day, I told a lady, as politely as possible, that a lot of people had bought the item and we were out. She called me a smart aleck.\n\nI saw impatience as I worked in different professions. Even now, I come across people each day who want people to stop what they are doing and answer questions or cater to their immediate needs, even if it\u2019s trivial and doesn\u2019t have to be taken care of right at that moment. Every now and then, people I meet in my part-time job will come in and start their conversation with \u201cOK. I need..\u201d Phone calls are the same. People call with some little issue and they want you to fix it right away.\n\nNow, as I unpack this impatient attitude, as usual, I start to understand. When you have a life change and are no longer on a schedule as before, you are still geared to being on that schedule. You still want to take care of things in a timely fashion. Even trivial things seem like big deals. The more I think about it, the more I relate.\n\nAnd then I realize, I\u2019m an older folk.\n\nStill, I meet folks who seem content and patient no matter what. They may ask you if you have time to help them or put in a request. These folks are not demanding, and they fully realize you may have things going on at the time.\n\n\u201cBut when you get a minute, could I ask you to do this for me?\u201d Of course! Who wouldn\u2019t want to help you if you have an attitude like that?\n\nI think a lot of impatience in older folks has to do with control, also. Many of us have been used to being in charge of things or the boss, and therefore, even when we don\u2019t have the same situations that lend themselves to being the boss, we still like to be in control. The need to be waited on hand and foot, right this minute and without delay, is something that still makes us feel vital and alive and in charge.\n\nSo, I get that too. As bad as I hate to admit it.\n\nI couldn\u2019t end this rant/observation without bringing up the little guy who used to shop at Walmart in the college town I lived, schooled, and worked in. He used to buy a six-pack of Ramen noodles for a buck and they seemed to be his favorite thing to buy on his trips to Walmart.\n\nYes, they were a buck. They were in unhealthy styrofoam containers. You added water, the spice packet, and after zapping it for a few minutes in the microwave, you had a delicious and comforting meal. In a styrofoam cup.\n\nSound healthy? I know they weren\u2019t good for you, but I lived on those suckers in college.\n\nAnyway, this little old guy was hilarious. I learned from some of the locals that he was a coach from way back, and in his retirement, he was a manager somewhere. In any case, now in his 90s, he was demanding and crusty. He yelled out things like \u201cI need to talk to you\u201d and \u201cHey boy, come here.\u201d He expected all of us to wait on him hand and foot, and by golly we better have plenty of Ramen noodles around.\n\nAfter a while, I got such a kick out of him that I made myself available when he came in. I think, after a while, he liked me because I found his curmudgeonly ways endearing. We were friends.\n\nOK, finally at the end of the story. I never knew his name, but I ran into him at the post office of all places one rare Saturday when I wasn\u2019t working. There he was, seeming to be hollering about his mail to the postal workers, but I think they knew this was his way too. I was there to get a stamp, I think, because I didn\u2019t go to the post office much in college.\n\n\u201cWell what are you doing here?\u201d he said to me without cracking a smile. I barely had time to tell him I wasn\u2019t working today when he barked out \u201cWell listen, if you don\u2019t have my noodles out there when I walk in today I\u2019m going to have to kick your skinny butt.\u201d\n\nAnd he turned around and walked out. No laugh. No smile.\n\nI drove out to Walmart and made sure things were in order before I went about my business.\n\nI mean, wouldn\u2019t you?",

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nThe American grocery store is a place where a bevy of food, drink and sundries are at shoppers\u2019 fingertips.\n\nBut researchers with the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University have found that despite the abundance of food options available on grocery shelves most contain processed or ultra-processed ingredients.\n\nNortheastern researchers analyzed ingredient lists of food available online from Target, Whole Foods and Walmart. The results were collected in GroceryDB, an online database of over 50,000 foods and it is searchable on the website Truefood. The study reveals the degree of food processing, empowering consumers to make informed choices.\n\n\n\n\u201cFood labels omit key information: whether a product is natural, processed or ultra processed,\u201d says Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, the Robert Gray Dodge professor of network science and a distinguished university professor at Northeastern. \u201cInspired by mounting evidence that food processing affects our health, we set out to change that.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeries of research projects\n\nThe study is the latest in a series of research projects that use artificial intelligence tools to identify ultra-processed foods in the American diet and understand their health implications.\n\nResearchers first used machine learning to develop an algorithm that could identify ultra-processed foods by analyzing patterns of concentrations of different nutrients in food. The algorithm assigned a score \u2014 which researchers called FPro \u2014 to classify the amount of processing that an individual food has undergone. The higher the FPro, the more processed the food.\n\nThe system found that 70% of the country\u2019s food supply is \u201cultra-processed,\u201d and thus is linked to a higher risk of developing a range of health issues. The algorithm was validated using population studies.\n\nResearchers next used the algorithm to analyze ingredient lists of food available online from Target, Whole Foods and Walmart. The results were aggregated in GroceryDB and made available on Truefood.\n\nFor the latest study, published this week in the journal Nature Food, the wealth of data collected allowed researchers to study the availability, and categories, of foods with varying degrees of processing and their price range.\n\nGiulia Menichetti, Associate Research Scientist at Northeastern\u2019s Network Science Institute.

Sign up for NGN\u2019s daily newsletter for news, discovery and analysis from around the world.\n\nThe researchers were also able to evaluate the degrees of food processing in different food categories.\n\nJerky, popcorn, chips, bread, biscuits and macaroni and cheese options had similar FPro scores, indicating that there are limited choices if you are shopping based on the amount of processing involved, researchers said.\n\nOn the other hand, a shopper could choose among a wider array of options from a food processing perspective if they were looking at cereals, milk and milk substitutes, pasta and snack bars, according to the research.",

            "content": "The last time Walmart refreshed its brand, the Great Recession loomed large, the iPhone was only a year old and a hyphen still split the retailer\u2019s legal name. On Monday (Jan. 13), the big-box store unveiled the latest update to its visual identity, one meant to embrace the growing role that digital and cross-channel capabilities play in an industry that has seen its makeup altered by technology over the past two decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about aligning the visual expression with how the brand has evolved since 2008,\u201d said David Hartman, Walmart\u2019s vice president of creative, of the changes. \u201cWhat that means, in a more practical sense, is really establishing ourself as truly an omnichannel retailer versus just a brick-and-mortar retailer and being able to serve the customer no matter where or how they want to encounter the brand.\u201d\n\nIncluded in the 2025 refresh are more vibrant yellows and blues (technically True Blue and Spark Yellow), a bigger emphasis on the sunburst-like \u201cspark\u201d icon Walmart implemented in 2008 and a new wordmark echoing one found on a trucker hat frequently sported by company founder Sam Walton, including on the cover of his book, \u201cMade in America.\u201d The Walton nod was inspired by Hartman\u2019s team at Walmart Creative Studio taking a deep dive into the corporate archives to find something that could connect heritage to the brand\u2019s current vision. The new typography is a custom design based on the font Antique Olive that Walmart is calling Everyday Sans.\n\n\u201cThere is a great, unique origin story about that typeface, its roots in our past and how we\u2019re bringing it forward to represent the brand where it is today,\u201d said Hartman.\n\nCentral to Walmart\u2019s refresh is a bigger emphasis on its spark logo as a standalone piece of iconography. Permission granted by Walmart\n\nThe Walmart spark appears largely the same as before but will play a different role in branding, with wider separation from the Walmart name on assets like storefronts. It\u2019s a move intended to reinforce the logo\u2019s status as a standalone symbol that can shore up Walmart\u2019s brand equity, according to Hartman. Other retailers have created easy visual shorthands for their brands, such as Target\u2019s bullseye or the Amazon smile.\n\nJones Knowles Ritchie assisted with Walmart\u2019s brand identity overhaul while Landor partnered on aspects like store executions. Publicis Groupe handles core marketing and advertising services.\n\nDigital-first evolution\n\nWhile Walmart\u2019s makeover is perhaps less dramatic than some past tweaks, such as ditching its hyphen and bowing the spark, it speaks to changing priorities for a company traditionally known for sprawling superstores.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a wholesale reinvention of the Walmart identity. It\u2019s very much an evolution versus a revolution,\u201d said Hartman.\n\nWalmart\u2019s focus on digital has accelerated since the launch of membership service Walmart+ in 2020, a response to Amazon, and the larger consumer gravitation toward online shopping, which has supported the firm\u2019s bigger crack into areas like selling advertising.\n\nWalmart\u2019s e-commerce sales in the U.S. were up 22% in Q3 of fiscal year 2025, extending a run that has dazzled investors. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d is an adage that could generally apply to brand marketing, but the company still saw aspects of its appearance where modernization felt important and spent the past year-plus hashing out what those changes should look like.\n\nIn a press statement, Walmart U.S. CMO William White described a goal of becoming an \u201cinspirational, digital retailer,\u201d comments echoed elsewhere in the refresh announcement.\n\n\u201cThe updated brand identity will help Walmart build credibility and connection, become known for its convenient digital-first services and be seen as a more modern, culturally dynamic brand,\u201d states a press release.\n\nVying for vibrancy\n\nOn the brick-and-mortar front, Walmart is introducing full-colored illustrated murals into store locations to add a pop of storytelling and aid customers in navigating different departments, a shift away from a previous system that relied on icons and line work. Some of these elements have been present at Walmart\u2019s experimental Store 4108 in Springdale, Arkansas, since October, but will roll out more widely in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from customers who are shopping in that [4108] store and the store associates that it\u2019s really helped improve the overall customer experience,\u201d said Hartman. \u201cCustomers describe it as feeling more warm and more inviting when they enter the store.\u201d\n\nAn illustrated mural decorates the vestibule of a Walmart location. Permission granted by Walmart\n\nThe embrace of elaborate, brighter visuals is part of a larger industry shift away from the minimalism that underpinned many branding efforts throughout the 2010s. For a rebrand in 2023, Pepsi introduced electric blues and deeper blacks, a different wordmark and decorative packaging that pivoted away from a previous focus on simplicity.\n\nIn other areas, Walmart\u2019s aim is to deliver greater consistency and a user-friendly experience across channels like its app and Walmart.com, some of the earliest places where the refresh will go live. A modular grid system for browsing will display product images, photography and headlines, among other tweaks to what Hartman termed Walmart\u2019s \u201cbrand operating system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen [consumers] encounter the brand on the app, what they see from a product expression and a brand identity looks very similar or close to the same as what they see in our marketing and what they see in our store experience,\u201d said Hartman of the refresh. \u201cWhen you think about digital and omnichannel, we want to make those visual connections as tight as we possibly can so it feels like a seamless experience to the customer.\u201d\n\nThe new look for Walmart will factor into its Q1 marketing campaign and activations, Hartman said, without offering specifics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very strategic about what assets get transferred and when,\u201d added Hartman. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an overnight change. It\u2019ll definitely be something that happens over time.\u201d",

Although the FDA posted the notification on its website on Jan. 8, the recall started on Dec. 11.\n\nWalmart confirmed in a statement that 242 locations across nine states were affected by the chicken broth recall, despite the FDA\u2019s declaration that the recalled cartons were transported to stores in Alabama and Arkansas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remaining states impacted were Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s statement outlines that the recall is due to \u201cpotential for packaging failures that could compromise the sterility of the product, resulting in spoilage.\u201d The chicken broth recall comprised 2,023 cases in total. With six goods in each case, 12,138 cartons of broth were recalled.\n\nThe recalled goods\u2019 \u201cbest used by\u201d date is March 25, 2026. Their UPC is \u201c007874206684.\u201d The recall notice did not mention whether any illnesses had been recorded as a result of consuming the chicken broth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe health and safety of our customers is always a top priority,\u201d a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAs soon as we were made aware of the issue, we took action to remove all impacted products from the select, impacted stores. We are continuing to work with the supplier to investigate.\u201d\n\nChicken Broth Recall is the Latest Recall\n\nThe chicken broth recall is the latest nationwide product recall to affect consumers. Last week, the FDA issued a recall of mashed potatoes found in a popular grocery store chain due to mislabeled ingredients.\n\nThe recalled 16-ounce packets of \u201cPremium Home-Style Mashed Potatoes\u201d included wheat that was not listed on the label, but Missouri consumers patronizing Dierbergs Markets were unaware of this.\n\nThe affected products, which are available for purchase at over two dozen Dierbergs Markets stores, are identified by their UPC number 231220006538, label ID number 92, and \u201csell by\u201d date of January 9, 2025. The company said that all of the recalled products were taken off retail shelves.",

That doesn\u2019t matter, according to the opening session at NRF 2025: Retail\u2019s Big Show. Just start.\n\nJohn Furner, president and CEO, Walmart U.S., joined Azita Martin, vice president and general manager, Retail & CPG, NVIDIA, on stage for a conversation that ran the gamut from current examples of AI use in retail to the importance of risk-taking and ongoing learning.\n\nMartin recalled a quote from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. \u201cSomone asked, \u2018Is ChatGPT going to take our job?\u2019 He made a point that has always stood out with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI always use it on his behalf. And that is, \u2018No, but someone using generative AI may take your job.\u2019 So, embrace it. It\u2019s a tool that just makes you more productive, and it\u2019s going to make you so much smarter.\u201d\n\nNVIDIA, a leader in artificial intelligence computing, recently announced its AI Blueprint for retail shopping assistants, a generative AI reference workflow designed to transform shopping experiences online and in stores. It helps developers create AI-powered digital assistants that work with and support human workers.\n\nThe company also unveiled Mega, an Omniverse Blueprint for developing, testing and optimizing physical AI and robot fleets at scale in a digital twin before deployment into real-world facilities. Then there\u2019s Nemotron, a family of models that have both language skills and perception, helping developers create and deploy AI agents across a range of applications. \u201cIt\u2019s to the physical world what ChatGPT is to text and language,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMartin spoke of L\u2019Or\u00e9al combining digital twins of assets with generative AI models, fostering faster \u2014 and more engaging \u2014 creation of ads and marketing campaigns. Walmart has also worked with NVIDIA\u2019s data science acceleration libraries to focus on forecasting. \u201cFor a company of Walmart\u2019s scale, we know that even one percent improvement in forecast accuracy represents a significant amount of business benefits,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Furner and Martin expressed excitement for the use of artificial intelligence in the supply chain. The ability to create a physically accurate digital twin of a store or distribution center, for example, allows the simulation of different layouts and the ability to observe how people and objects interact before capital investment is made.\n\nLowe\u2019s has created a digital twin of 1,700 of its stores, Martin said, updating several times a day with operational and inventory data. \u201cAs a result, it will simulate different layouts, to really optimize how customers are shopping in the stores,\u201d she said, \u201chow to change their layouts, and ultimately improve their sales and revenue.\u201d The company is now trying 3D digital twins with its planograms to optimize merchandising, she said.\n\nFurner likes to think of digital twins as akin to a video game. \u201cIt\u2019s an idea in your head, and there\u2019s a reality you\u2019ve created, you simulate, and play in it, and results happen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do the same thing in business.\u201d\n\nFurner urged show attendees to take full advantage of the AI exhibits, sessions and discussions throughout the event. \u201cListen, learn, ask questions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put this together for all of you, and we want you to benefit from it.\u201d",

Whether you live in a big city like Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, or Austin or you live in a smaller town such as Gilmer, Bryan, Jasper, or Marshall, you are experiencing a shortage. Nope, it's not toilet paper. No, it's not Vienna Sausage. And no, it's not even eggs. The shortage that all of us have experienced is the shortage of time.\n\nMick Haupt via Unsplash.com Mick Haupt via Unsplash.com loading...\n\nIt's a proven fact that consumers in Texas and everywhere for that matter just don't have time to shop at one store for one item and then move on to another store for a second item. That's why retailers such as Walmart, Target, and Costco have designed their stores to encompass almost every consumer need.\n\nBeing able to buy groceries, tires, fishing lures, motor oil, baby oil, and frozen pizza all in the same place saves us time. It makes retailers like Walmart, Costco, and Target rich. And these giant retailers have established locations all across the state. Did you know that 90% of the American population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store?\n\nGerman Grocery Chain Aldi To Invest $3.4 Billion Into U.S. Stores Scott Olson, Getty Images loading...\n\nAnd what is the reason that more and more Americans are visiting Walmart, Target, and Costco these days? Look in your pantry and your 'fridge. It's groceries. Grocery sales are a huge part of these retailers' profit margin and they are keenly aware of subtle changes that happen in consumer mindsets and choices.\n\nOne of the big trends in groceries is the move toward \"healthy\" items. But what is healthy? What can be labelled as \"healthy\"? And is it possible that some products labelled as healthy can be far from good for you?\n\nDan Gold via Unsplash.com Dan Gold via Unsplash.com loading...\n\nThat last question about labels is the genesis of a sweeping change that consumers will see across the retail landscape over the next three years. The changes are mandated by the Food and Drug Administration and here's what those changes will mean for you as you peruse the aisles of your favorite store.\n\nPhoto by Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images Photo by Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images loading...\n\nAccording to the soon-to-be-in-place guidelines from the FDA in order for a food to be considered \"healthy\" it must:\n\n1: Contain a certain amount of food from at least one of the food groups or subgroups (such as fruit, vegetables, grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy and protein foods) recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n\n2: Meet specific limits for added sugars, saturated fat and sodium.\n\nWhile that might look confusing at first blush it really isn't. For example, there are some foods that you already know are \"healthy\" and will be labelled as such without hesitation. Those items include water, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, avocados, nuts and seeds, and higher-fat fish, such as salmon, and olive oil.\n\nLucky Charms Joe Raedle, Getty Images loading...\n\nConversely, some foods that might seem healthy but really aren't won't be able to carry the word \"healthy\" on their label. Foods like highly sweetened cereals and yogurts and fortified white bread.\n\nYou can also expect more stringent and precise labels to be presented for supplements, vitamins, and other products that promise a health benefit. The change should be good for consumers who are actively trying to modify their lifestyle to be more healthy.\n\nKayla Maurais via Unsplash.com Kayla Maurais via Unsplash.com loading...\n\nBut remember the mandated changes aren't required to be in place for another three years. So, you still have a lot of time to have the wool pulled over your eyes by products that would like you to believe they are beneficial for your good health. Become an informed shopper and know before you go.",

Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams will shift to a new role, Meta said.\n\nThe company will also stop an effort to work with third-party suppliers that are diverse-owned, Meta said, adding that it would roll back a \"diverse slate\" hiring program that ensured a diverse range of candidates was considered for each open role.\n\nStill, Meta emphasized the importance of making products accessible for all consumers and employing a multi-talented workforce.\n\nThe move follows an announcement from McDonald's earlier this week that the company would end a few initiatives centered on diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.\n\nWhile emphasizing a \"steadfast\" commitment to \"inclusion,\" the company said it would remove goals for diversity within its senior leadership ranks, and do away with a program that encourages suppliers to conduct diversity training and achieve diversity at the management level.\n\nMeta and McDonald's \u2013 like many of their peers \u2013 pledged to expand DEI commitments in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. In recent years, however, companies have faced pressure to revoke DEI policies amid an upsurge of conservative backlash and a Supreme Court decision effectively ending affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nThe company announcements mark the latest in a string of corporations rolling back their DEI programs, including Walmart and John Deere, experts told ABC News. It remains unclear to what extent the moves will impact worker diversity at the firms, they added.\n\nMcDonald's said it remains committed to inclusion, noting that 30% of its U.S. leaders belong to underrepresented groups. The company previously aimed to attain 35% of such leaders from underrepresented groups by the end of 2025, according to their 2023-24 Purpose & Impact Report.\n\nIn a statement about the policy shift, McDonald's said it \"completed a comprehensive Civil Rights Audit (CRA) that looked at all aspects of inclusion across our system\" and also cited the \"shifting legal landscape\" following the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action in college admissions, as well as \"other companies who are also re-evaluating their own programs.\"\n\nMcDonald's also said it had achieved some of its diversity goals, including spending at least 25% of its budget for third-party suppliers on \"diverse-owned\" companies.\n\n\"The tides have turned,\" Traci Sitzmann, a professor of workforce development at the University of Colorado, Denver who studies corporate diversity, told ABC News. \"Many CEOs are responding to the pushback by retracting these policies.\"\n\nThe Meta (formerly Facebook) logo marks the entrance of their corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Nov. 9, 2022. Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nSome proponents of DEI sharply criticized the policy changes announced by McDonald's.\n\n\"McDonald\u2019s is joining a small but concerning list of companies that once touted the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion, but have now abandoned their values and capitulated to right-wing activists,\" Andrea Abrams, executive director of advocacy group American Pride Rises, told ABC News in a statement.\n\nStill, the exact implications of the recent rollbacks remain unclear, and alarm among DEI advocates may prove overstated, Corinne Post, a professor of management at Villanova University who specializes in diversity programs, told ABC News.\n\nCorporations face competitive pressure to recruit and retain talented workers, giving them incentive to establish an environment where employees of varied identities feel welcome, Post said. She noted that some of the announced changes at McDonald's and elsewhere appear to be \"surface-level\" efforts meant to assuage critics.\n\n\"This is not a fundamental cancellation of DEI policies,\" Post said.\n\nSitzmann, of the University of Colorado, disagreed. The policy changes at these firms suggest that corporate commitment to DEI depends on where public opinion on the issue stands at a given time, Sitzmann said, which risks compromising employee trust and hurting company performance.\n\n\"By being inauthentic in their commitment to diversity, these companies are muddying the waters and hindering their employees' ability to produce,\" Sitzmann said.\n\nHere are some of the companies that have announced rollbacks of their DEI programs:\n\nWalmart\n\nWalmart said in November that it would end some DEI efforts, including the consideration of gender and race in its evaluation of companies participating in its supply chain.\n\nThe retail giant said it didn't currently have quotas and didn't plan to impose them going forward; however, it planned to stop collecting demographic data when determining financing eligibility for grants.\n\nWalmart will be \"reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it is not financially supporting sexualized content targeting kids,\" the company said, noting that it would also exit the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index, which evaluates companies for their LGBTQ+ inclusion.\n\n\u201cWe've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect,\" the statement continued, \"but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone.\"\n\nThe company said in a statement to ABC News, \"Our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today. We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America.\"\n\nJohn Deere\n\nJohn Deere posted a list of policy changes on X in July, citing a need to prioritize efforts that \"more closely align our business strategy to meet the needs of our customers.\"\n\nThe company said it would no longer participate in or support cultural awareness events, such as parades or festivals. Business Resource Groups \u2013 which connect workers who share racial, gender, sexual orientation or other identities \u2013 would focus solely on work-related topics, the company added.\n\nStill, John Deere affirmed its belief that \"a diverse workforce enables us to best meet our customers' needs and because of that we will track and advance the diversity of our organization.\"\n\nFord Motor President and CEO Jim Farley attends the press day of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, Sept. 13, 2023. Rebecca Cook/Reuters\n\nFord\n\nIn September, Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a memo to employees that the company would no longer pursue some of its DEI initiatives.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index and make identity-based Employee Resource Groups open to all workers, Farley said in the memo, which was posted on X by conservative activist Robby Starbuck.\n\n\"Ford does not utilize hiring quotas or tie compensation to the achievement of specific diversity goals,\" Farley said.\n\nHowever, he added, the company remains \"deeply committed to fostering a safe and inclusive workplace and building a team that leverages diverse perspectives backgrounds and thinking styles.\"\n\nHarley-Davidson\n\nIn August, Harley-Davidson said in a post on X that it had put an end to its DEI efforts months earlier. \"We have not operated a DEI function since April 2024, and we do not have a DEI function today,\" the company said.\n\nThe motorcycle manufacturer would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign and ensure that all employee training is free of \"socially motivated content,\" Harley-Davidson said.\n\nEmployee Resource Groups would focus strictly on professional development and other workplace topics, the company added.\n\n\"We see it as every leader's role to ensure we have an employee base that reflects our customers and the geographies in which we operate,\" Harley-Davidson said.",

            "content": "Shifting Partnerships Highlight Challenges in Building Cost-Effective and Scalable Drone Delivery Systems\n\nWalmart\u2019s recent decision to end its partnership with DroneUp marks a significant moment for the drone delivery industry. The retail giant terminated its collaboration with the logistics provider and reportedly divested its stake in the company. This move reflects both the evolving dynamics of drone delivery models and the challenges of scaling cost-effective operations.\n\nThe partnership, established in 2021 after promising COVID-19 test kit delivery trials, faced inevitable operational hurdles. Despite initial success, the collaboration struggled with high costs and logistical barriers. The split underscores the complexities of sustainable drone delivery, even as the technology advances.\n\nWalmart\u2019s New Drone Delivery Strategy\n\nAlthough Walmart has parted ways with DroneUp, it continues to invest in drone delivery through partnerships with Wing and Zipline. Walmart recently expanded its delivery network across the Dallas-Fort Worth area, aiming to cover up to 75% of the region. This pivot positions Walmart as the U.S. retailer with the broadest drone delivery footprint.\n\nAll of the major drone delivery players have taken different approaches to the operational problems. Wing, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, operates in some areas by placing its drones on rooftops of shopping malls, offering delivery services to nearby homes. Zipline, on the other hand, has adapted its overseas experience \u2014delivering medical supplies in countries like Rwanda\u2014to U.S. retail operations.\n\nWalmart\u2019s strategy shift illustrates the need for diverse approaches to drone delivery, as different providers offer unique solutions tailored to specific markets and operational challenges.\n\nThe Challenges of Drone Delivery Models\n\nThe Walmart shift highlights a central issue in drone delivery: achieving cost-effective scalability. Tech giants like Amazon and others have made significant investments in the sector. Still, creating a model that balances costs and customer expectations \u2013 and meets regulatory requirements \u2013 has proven difficult.\n\nAmazon and Wing both developed their own aircraft, an investment-heavy approach that has required years of R&D. Amazon works to deliver it\u2019s own products, which could require even more investment in developing local distribution centers to bring product closer to consumers. Companies like Wing and Flytrex focus on local delivery from hubs like malls or fast-food chains, potentially reducing infrastructure demands.\n\nZipline\u2019s approach, which looks significantly different than any of the other models, is another example of experimentation with drone logistics. However, details on the costs per delivery remain scarce.\n\nCustomer willingness to pay is another challenge. While drone delivery offers convenience, few customers are likely to pay $10\u2013$15 per delivery, making affordability a key factor for widespread adoption.\n\nLooking Ahead: What\u2019s Next for DroneUp and Walmart\u2019s Partners\n\nDespite losing Walmart\u2019s backing, DroneUp is poised to leverage its newly acquired Part 135 FAA certification for expanded commercial operations. The certification could allow the company to explore alternative revenue streams or partnerships that fit its operational strengths.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart\u2019s collaboration with Wing and Zipline provides a fresh perspective on viable drone delivery models. These partnerships demonstrate how strategic pivots and diverse operational frameworks might overcome the obstacles that prevent drone delivery from operating at scale.\n\nAs the drone delivery industry matures, companies must navigate evolving regulations, operational costs, and consumer expectations. The Walmart-DroneUp breakup serves as a reminder that no single model has yet proven to be the definitive solution. However, continued innovation and partnerships may pave the way for sustainable and scalable drone delivery services in the future.\n\nWant DRONELIFE news delivered to your inbox every weekday?

            "content": "Raises concern with Walmart's recent decision to end supplier diversity programs, philanthropic efforts, equity trainings, and internal use of \"diversity\" and \"DEI\"\n\nOAKLAND \u2013 California Attorney General Rob Bonta today, as part of a coalition of 13 attorneys general, sent a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillan expressing concern with regarding Walmart's recent decision to step away from its commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Walmart was vocal in expressing a commitment to the values of social justice and equity. A decision by one of the world\u2019s largest retailers and a major California employer to abandon this commitment, just four years later, would be highly concerning. In the letter, the attorneys general urge Walmart to reaffirm their commitment to nondiscriminatory, ethical businesses practices and raise concern that the abrupt end to these programs may run afoul of state and federal nondiscrimination laws.\n\n\u201cMore than 100,000 Californians are employed at Walmart, and these employees deserve a workplace that is free from discrimination and harassment,\u201dsaid Attorney General Bonta. \u201cI urge Walmart to reconsider its drastic decision to end diversity programs. Maintaining a diverse and equitable workplace is good for workers, good for consumers, and good for the bottom line.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, the attorneys general argue that Walmart\u2019s decision to phase out supplier diversity programs, close down the Center for Racial Equality, end equity trainings for staff, and remove the words \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cDEI\u201d from company documents and employee titles risks undermining important social progress and antidiscrimination efforts. The attorneys general also express concern that these actions risk violating state and federal law, which require Walmart to provide a workplace that is free from unlawful harassment and discrimination.\n\nThe attorneys general cite Walmart\u2019s decision to end supplier diversity goals and efforts to ensure fair consideration of all potential partners as creating confusion around why targeted efforts are no longer necessary and how a wind-down in these programs will comply with non-discrimination requirements. The attorneys general also question whether these changes required the restructuring or elimination of positions relating to equity training and DEI initiatives and, if so, whether this was done in a way that did not disproportionately impact protected groups. In the letter, the attorneys general invite Walmart to address these questions, to affirm its commitment to the important values of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and to clarify how it intends to ensure compliance with state non-discrimination laws.\n\nAttorney General Bonta joins the attorneys general of Illinois, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont sending the letter.\n\nA copy of the letter is available here.",

            "content": "When Walmart made a push into credit cards in 2018, it turned to one of the largest banks in America, Capital One. The two giants signed an exclusive long-term deal that promised to help Walmart offer its clients the latest in digital credit card products, while Capital One was basically given the keys to Walmart\u2019s kingdom: access to a retail market larger than some nations' GDPs without any of that pesky competition.\n\nIt didn't work out. Things started to fall apart in 2023 when Capital One violated terms in its contract that dictated certain customer service requirements, including how long it would take to post charges to a minimum percentage of cards. Last month, Walmart ended the exclusive deal with Capital One, citing in court documents multiple issues with the bank\u2019s customer service\u2014but not before Capital One accumulated $8.5 billion worth of credit card balances, which it will retain. Capital One charges customers between 19.48% and 29.99% for past-due Walmart Rewards purchases.\n\nWalmart, No. 1 on this year\u2019s Fortune 500 list, is now likely courting potential replacements, with top candidates including Stamford, Conn.\u2013based Synchrony Bank, London-based Barclays, and Washington State\u2013based Coastal Community Bank (CCB), according to fintech bank researcher Tim Switzer of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \u201cThey could choose any one of those, and it'd be exclusive,\u201d says Switzer. \u201cOr they could choose all three.\u201d\n\nSizing up the competition\n\nSynchrony Bank is a subsidiary of Synchrony Financial. In March, Synchrony bought Ally Lending for an undisclosed amount, onboarding $2.2 billion in loan receivables, though in its latest investor call for the first quarter of 2024, executives said nonprime borrower spending slowed. A spinoff of the lending arm of the shuttered GE Capital Retail Bank, Synchrony already offers a credit card for Walgreens and Walmart sister company Sam\u2019s Club, and specializes in retail credit cards, including J.C. Penney and Lowe's.\n\nAs for Barclays, the bank approved a plan to prioritize consumer lending in February 2023. As part of that plan, the bank with over a $1 trillion in assets sold $1 billion in higher-risk credit card receivables to Blackstone. It has since then made available to U.S. consumers its Xbox Mastercard and is reportedly in talks with GM to receive $2 billion of card balances currently held by Goldman Sachs. According to Switzer, Barclays would likely shy away from subprime credit cards, or those designed for people with poor or limited credit.\n\nCCB was founded in 1997 as a community bank serving Washington State. An early mover providing banking as a service, the company quickly onboarded more than 40 clients, helping them build products that require a banking license and regulatory compliance. Since March 2020, CCB stock has grown 366%, to $44.35, peaking at $53.23 in January 2022 when Walmart announced its stealth fintech startup Hazel had bought two fintech companies, One and Earn, banked by CCB. Though the company reportedly lost 10 clients over an 18-month period, Switzer says, \u201cIt's reasonable that One, at least, has a chance to become a sole provider of Walmart's credit card business\u2026or to be one of several.\u201d",

            "content": "The war on diversity, equity and inclusion is only heating up as the U.S. transitions to another Trump presidency, and corporations are increasingly feeling forced to take a stance on one side or the other. Some are standing firm on their commitments while others are slimming or nixing their initiatives as they work to appease consumer bases and shareholders, and for some, their workforces.\n\nIn the retail space, two major competitors are taking different stances. Walmart in November announced it was scaling back its DEI programs. That includes withdrawing from the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index and ending its practice of prioritizing suppliers based on race or gender criteria. Walmart also chose not to renew its five-year commitment to a racial equity center established in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in 2020.\n\nCostco took a different approach when faced with a proposal from shareholders challenging the retail giant\u2019s DEI policies. Its board of directors unanimously recommended voting against the proposal, stating \u201cour Board has considered this proposal and believes that our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect that all companies, especially the larger ones, are going to face questions from their board members, their important shareholder groups, and also their employees, asking where we are on the spectrum of wanting to keep the programs together\" Niki Ramirez, founder and principal consultant at HR consultancy HR Answers.\n\n\u201cI suspect that all companies, especially the larger ones, are going to face questions from their board members, their important shareholder groups, and also their employees, asking where we are on the spectrum of wanting to keep the programs together,\u201d Niki Ramirez, founder and principal consultant at HR Answers, a human resources consultancy.\n\nThe pressure over DEI programs is expected to intensify this year, according to a report from i4cp, a human capital research firm. \u201cIf it hasn\u2019t happened already, HR, the C-suite, and the board need to scenario plan and prepare for increased opposition to organizational DE&I initiatives,\u201d according to that report.\n\nEmployers have largely started by looking at and shifting the language and messaging they use around such programs. For instance, the Society for Human Resources Professionals announced last year that it was dropping the word \u201cequity\u201d from its DEI programming.\n\n\u201cIf they aren\u2019t dismantling their DE&I departments and initiatives to avoid scrutiny, many companies are instead simply changing their language. Typically, dropping either the \u2018D\u2019 or the \u2018E\u2019 and talking more about inclusion, which is viewed as a safer description,\u201d according to the i4cp report.\n\n\u201cSome organizations are trying to blend existing DE&I efforts and professionals into other areas of the company to avoid having a standalone function, even rebranding DE&I under broader organizational programs such as employee engagement or leadership development,\u201d that report said.\n\n\u201cWhile some organizations are integrating DEI principles into broader business functions, this risks losing the focus and intentionality that true inclusion requires,\u201d said Rebecca Perrault, global vp of culture, diversity, and sustainability at Magnit, a contingent workforce management firm.\n\n\u201cWhile some organizations are integrating DEI principles into broader business functions, this risks losing the focus and intentionality that true inclusion requires.\" Rebecca Perrault, global vp of culture, diversity, and sustainability at Magnit.\n\n\u201cMoving DEI out of its dedicated space may feel like adaptation, but it also signals hesitation in the face of backlash \u2014 a short-term response to long-term challenges. Let\u2019s be clear, inclusive practices don\u2019t just happen. They demand deliberate effort and accountability,\u201d Perrault said.\n\nUltimately, HR leaders should prepare to present outcomes from past DEI efforts and align those with proposed initiatives with their organization\u2019s strategy, market, culture leadership, and talent requirements, according to the i4cp report. And senior leaders should plan and discuss with the board what their plans are if DEI strategies are targeted by activists outside (or even inside) the organization.\n\nCompanies will have to carefully navigate these issues, as taking a strong stance can have both positive and negative consequences in terms of public perception and workforce sentiment.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the process for determining what to do next, what I see them doing that is similar, is acting on their values,\u201d said Ramirez.\n\n\u201cFor organizations that have clearly stated that their values, in some way, shape or form, to incorporate diversity, equity and inclusion or belonging, components of social justice \u2013 if we see that showing up in their values, then I think that\u2019s part of how they strategically decide what to do,\u201d she said.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWalmart expects to miss its 2025 and 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, which the retail giant said in an update posted Wednesday \u201cwill require innovation and technology that is not available or economically viable, or fully scalable today.\u201d\n\nThe company in 2020 set goals to reduce its scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2025 and 65% by 2030. However, Walmart said Dec. 18 that its annual operational emissions \u2014 which include scope 1 and 2 emissions \u2014 rose 3.91% year-over-year in 2023.\n\nWalmart said the year-over-year increase was due to transportation emissions, aging refrigeration equipment and slowing renewable energy expansion. The company said due to factors beyond its control, including energy policy and infrastructure, it anticipates missing its 2025 and 2030 targets and will consider revising those targets in 2025.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWalmart said it will continue to work towards its target of reaching net-zero operational emissions by 2040, but its \u201cprogress will not be linear.\u201d The company\u2019s Dec. 18 update said its 2023 operational emissions were 19.3% lower than its 2015 baseline.\n\nIn addition to challenges with energy policy and infrastructure in the global markets where Walmart operates, the company said it will miss its likely target date for those emission reductions due a lack of availability of cost-effective, low-emitting refrigeration and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Additionally, Walmart said low-carbon heavy tractor transportation probably will not emerge in a cost-effective manner \u201cuntil the 2030s.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to work towards our goals, progress depends on many factors outside our control, including public policy, emergence and cost-effectiveness of low carbon technologies, and broad sectoral transitions in energy systems, transportation, materials and agriculture,\u201d Walmart said.\n\nThe company said it sees changes to energy grids \u201cin every region\u201d Walmart operates in or sources energy. It also expects the capital and costs of projects to transition to less-polluting refrigerants or renewable energy-powered vehicles to \u201cremain a challenge for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Walmart said the calculation of emissions itself is challenging given uncertainties about target-setting and standardization for greenhouse gas emissions. Also, regulator calculations and reporting standards do not always align with voluntary standards, and the emissions factors and industry averages used to calculate emissions can change.\n\nAlthough the company expects to miss its 2025 and 2030 emissions reduction targets, Walmart is on track or ahead of schedule for another set of climate goals.\n\nThe retail giant aims to power half of its operations with renewable energy by 2025 and power all of its global operations with renewable sources by 2035.\n\nAs of 2023, the company powered 48% of its global electricity needs with renewable energy and directly procured 30% of its energy needs through renewable contracts. Purchased electricity accounted for all of Walmart\u2019s scope 2 emissions and 46% of its operational emissions for 2023, according to the update.\n\nThe company also reached its goal to reduce, avoid or sequester 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in global supply chains earlier this year, six years ahead of its 2030 target date. Walmart credited its suppliers for reaching the goal, which have reported projects in progress that expect to exceed its gigaton target.\n\nWalmart is not the only company expected to miss its climate ambitions. PepsiCo announced this summer that it anticipates missing several plastics circularity and reduction sustainability goals. More recently, Coca-Cola quietly scrapped a 2030 target to reduce its absolute emissions 25% over a 2015 baseline.\n\nIn the financial sector this year, Morgan Stanley abandoned a goal to facilitate 50 million metric tons of plastic pollution prevention, removal or reduction by 2030. The financial institution scrapped the standalone goal due to the lack of data availability, a Morgan Stanley spokesperson said at the time.\n\nThe plastic pollution prevention target was folded into a broader sustainable finance goal, according to the spokesperson.",

McMillon is one of many executives meeting with Trump ahead of Inauguration Day. Others include Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta (META) co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla, and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.\n\n\u201cDoug enjoyed reconnecting with President Trump on a range of topics,\" a Walmart spokesperson told Yahoo Finance, adding that it was a \"great conversation.\"\n\nMcMillon's tenure atop Walmart began in 2014, and he previously worked with Trump's first administration. He served on an advisory council before it was disbanded in August 2017, then on a special task force in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020.\n\n\"We stand ready to help move our country forward,\u201d Walmart's spokesperson added.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon shakes hands with US President Donald Trump after he announced the declaration of a national emergency in reaction to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic on March 13, 2020, in Washington, D.C.

The company did not share the topics discussed, but McMillon has previously said that one of his top concerns is the impact of potential tariffs.\n\nRead more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?\n\nThe president-elect has floated a range of new tariffs, such as 10% tariff on all imports and 60% on Chinese imports to cut the trade deficit.\n\nPotential tariffs could hit the chain's profit due to elevated costs. The retailer might have to pass along that cost to healthy but price-sensitive consumers heading into 2025.\n\nMcMillon said his team successfully dealt with tariffs under Trump's first administration in 2017.\n\n\"We're positioned to manage it, but what I worry about is customers experiencing higher prices, and we're going do everything we can to try and keep them low,\" he told Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi.\n\nHe then shared that he plans to encourage leaders he meets to \"be strategic and really thoughtful with them [tariffs] and help them understand how the math works.\"\n\nWhen labor strikes hit the East and Gulf Coast ports last October, Strategic Resource Group's Burt Flickinger told Yahoo Finance that 80% of the nonfood goods sold at Walmart come from the Asia Pacific and international regions.\n\nRead more: Best credit cards for shopping at Walmart (2025)\n\nWalmart's stock has been on a tear over the past year.

            "content": "Dividend-growth stocks have historically proven to be market-beating investments, particularly when companies sustain distribution increases over extended periods. According to academic studies, companies that consistently boost their payouts while maintaining reasonable valuations and payout ratios below 75% tend to outperform the S&P 500, especially when their five-year dividend growth rates exceed 6%.\n\nWalmart (WMT 1.01%) stands out in this category, with its 51-year streak of dividend increases and conservative 41.4% payout ratio. However, the retail giant's shares have surged 75% over the past 12 months (as of Jan. 6, 2025), pushing its valuation well above historical averages.\n\nBelow, I'll break down the retailer's core value proposition and risk factors to determine if its shares are still worth buying at the onset of 2025.\n\nDigital muscle flexing drives growth\n\nThe days of viewing Walmart as just another brick-and-mortar dinosaur are long gone. The retail giant has transformed its massive network of over 4,600 U.S. stores into a formidable advantage against pure-play e-commerce competitors, with home delivery now available from 4,500 locations.\n\nThe company's digital marketplace has exploded from a modest 35 million items in 2017 to an eye-popping 700 million today. Its Walmart+ subscription service, priced at $98 annually versus Amazon Prime's $139, bundles free home delivery, free shipping, fuel savings, and Paramount+ streaming access.\n\nThis comprehensive digital strategy suggests the North American retail giant isn't just adapting to the e-commerce era -- it's actively shaping the future of retail. That's a big deal in an industry forecast to reach $2 trillion in sales by 2030, according to multiple research firms.\n\nGrocery empire fuels the engine\n\nWhile competitors scramble for market share, Walmart quietly dominates U.S. grocery retail with a commanding 25% slice of the pie. This grocery stronghold generates consistent cash flow and keeps customers coming back week after week, creating a moat that even Amazon struggles to cross.\n\nThe grocery segment, accounting for roughly 60% of U.S. sales, is a natural hedge against economic uncertainty. Few competitors can match Walmart's scale, pricing power, and supplier relationships in this space, giving the company substantial firepower to fund its ambitious digital-expansion plans.\n\nPremium price tag raises eyebrows, while income potential is meager\n\nAfter its meteoric rise in 2024, Walmart's stock now commands a hefty 33.1 times forward earnings multiple. This premium valuation towers above the S&P 500's already rich 23.5 times earnings multiple, raising questions about whether the retail-giant's growth prospects justify such a steep price.\n\nThe valuation looks even more challenging from an income perspective. Despite 51 consecutive years of dividend increases, the company's 3.27% average dividend-growth rate over the prior five years falls significantly short of the 6% threshold that academic studies link to continued market outperformance. Moreover, the stock's modest 0.99% yield, trailing the S&P 500's already meager 1.25% payout, makes the premium valuation even harder to justify from an income-generation standpoint.\n\nIs Walmart stock a top buy for 2025?\n\nWalmart's digital transformation and commanding grocery market share have forged an impressive growth story. However, at 33.1 times forward earnings and unappealing dividend metrics, the stock's premium valuation likely captures much of the company's near-term upside potential, even as its long-term prospects remain bright.\n\nAs a result, Walmart stock doesn't exactly leap off the page as a must-buy at the start of 2025. Though the retail giant's long-term strategy looks rock solid, investors might find better value by staying patient and building positions during market pullbacks, when this retailer's premium valuation comes back down to earth.",

            "content": "In early December I hosted an SN webinar with top industry executives from Raley\u2019s, Giant Eagle and Lowes Foods. One of the primary topics of conversation was the impact that Walmart is having on regional grocers. Below is a summary of that conversation and additional detail with some updates.\n\nWalmart has been steadily increasing its market share in the online grocery sector, significantly impacting regional grocers across the United States.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Brick Meets Click and Mercatus, Walmart captured a staggering 37% of U.S. online grocery sales in Q2 2024. This represents a substantial gain from previous years and has put immense pressure on smaller, regional players but also the big guys like Kroger, Albertsons, Publix, etc.The data in the Bricks Meet Clicks Mercatus are great but unfortunately not surprising.\n\nWalmart has been investing significant dollars and resources in technology to enhance the customer experience to grow their online grocery business and the price and convenience is stealing once loyal customers from many regionals. Global Walmart ecommerce sales saw 20% year-over-year growth.\n\nWhy? Why is Walmart investing so much energy on growing their ecommerce business. It\u2019s simple, also, according to a Grocery Dive article and Bricks Meet Clicks Grocery e-commerce sales are predicted to grow 3 times faster than in-store sales. WHAT? ecommerce in grocery wasn\u2019t just a COVID fad! While not growing at the explosive rate it did during COVID customers are continuing to move toward the convenience of an online or mobile order.\n\nRelated:Is \u2018Unified Commerce\u2019 the next big buzzword?\n\nGrocery ecommerce sales are predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5% over the next five years \u2014 more than three times faster than the 1.3% rate forecasted for in-store.\n\nWalmart has gained market share in several areas including:\n\nRural and suburban areas: As the famous stat goes 99% of the country\u2019s population lives within 15 miles of a Walmart. Their 4,600-plus stores in the U.S. provides Walmart an extensive store network and provides a convenient pickup option for customers\n\nPrice-sensitive consumers: In this inflationary period Walmart\u2019s reputation for low prices attracts budget-conscious shoppers seeking online grocery convenience\n\nTime-strapped customers: Walmart\u2019s efficient fulfillment processes and delivery options cater to busy consumers who value convenience\n\nThe good news is that all hope is not lost. There are solutions that several regional grocers have already implemented and have significantly reduced their exposure and grown their loyal base of customers.\n\nRelated:How AI, and the automated store ecosystem, will transform stores in the next decade\n\nRegional grocers can\u2019t do much about the sheer number of locations Walmart has but they can combat the customers they are taking (90% of Americans live within 10 miles of one of its stores). They need to focus on their unique strengths in their communities and leverage technology to enhance the customer experience. Here are just a few ways retailers have defended and even expanded their turf:\n\nHyperlocal focus: Emphasize locally sourced products and partnerships with regional suppliers to differentiate offerings\n\nLoyalty / Personalization programs: Loyalty programs need to be the focal point of your roadmap. Omni-channel promotions provide a true 360 degree experience. Reward repeat customers with exclusive discounts and benefits across the store. Personalization is crucial as discussed above but providing relevant information and suggestions will strengthen the relationship and trust with the customer. It also provides attribution for other marketing and retail media events and helps create a true omni-channel experience\n\nEnhanced convenience: Explore innovative 1 st and 3 rd party delivery options and implement technology to enhance pickup. Some 30% of online Walmart customers paid a convenience fee to received orders in 3 hours or less\n\nRetail Media: Establishing or building up your retail media strategy will be a crucial part of your 2025 strategy. No matter how big or small all retailers need to find their strategy in order to take advantage of the momentum in this space. It will help drive margin as well as a number of the experiences mentioned above\n\nRelated:3 essential pricing strategies grocers must master for 2025\n\nOrder Management and Fulfillment engine: It\u2019s not enough to have a great front end ordering process. A comprehensive order management and fulfillment solution is necessary to own the entire experience and scale order volume. There is nothing worse than having a great website/mobile app with a high conversion rate but not having the capacity to fulfill the volume in a timely manner\n\nPick up enhancements: While delivery has caught up to pick up (delivery - $4.8 billion / pickup $4.2 billion in October 2024), pickup is still growing and is a convenient for customers. Pickup grew 20% from October 2023 to October 2024. Expanding pickup windows, utilizing location technology to shorten wait times and enabling upsells during the pickup process will help close the gap and increase an already larger basket size\n\nReduce Substitutions: If you are utilizing a perpetual inventory solution, use that data to integrate into your front-end ecommerce sites as well as your fulfillment engine to educate customers and associates that those items may be in stock soon or simply in the back room and no need for a sub. Substitutions are typically the number one complaint from customers as they don\u2019t get 100% of what they want from their shopping experience. Minimizing subs and handling the communication when they do happen should be a major focus of anyone\u2019s ecommerce program\n\nFresh & MTO (Made-to-Order): Weekly groceries as well as today\u2019s lunch and dinner options are not only convenient but drives more visits to the store and further creates loyalty\n\nThe worst thing that regional retailers can do to try and compete with Walmart and other mass retailers is NOTHING. Maintaining the \u2018status quo\u2019 for fear of failure is no longer an option. With competition from Walmart and the advancement of AI, innovations within retail are moving fast and retailers need to advance their efforts and speed up their roadmaps to not just keep, but grow their customer base.\n\nRegional grocers can level the playing field by adopting technologies that help with all the above. Some retailers have the IT resources to build some of the solutions required to enhance their ecommerce ecosystem. However, the majority either don\u2019t have the resources or the expertise to build themselves. The good news is there are plenty of Cloud-based solutions and technology providers that specialize in these solutions. This can help regional grocers get to market faster, with less internal resources and most likely without significant upfront investment.\n\nWant to discuss more or add to the discussion?

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is suing Walmart and financial technology platform Branch Messenger, alleging they forced delivery drivers on the Spark platform to use specific deposit accounts to get paid and misled the workers about how they could access their earnings, according to a Dec. 23, 2024, press release.\n\nThe CFPB claims this led to workers paying more than $10 million in fees to transfer their earnings to an account of their choice.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Walmart said the CFPB \u201crushed\u201d its investigation into the retailer and that it will fight the lawsuit in court.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe retailer told its Spark drivers that they were required to use Branch to get paid and that they would be terminated if they did not want to use these accounts, according to the CFPB\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Walmart deceived workers regarding the availability of same-day access to their earnings and made drivers follow a complex process to access their funds, leading them to pay what CFPB Director Rohit Chopra called \u201cjunk fees.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalmart made false promises, illegally opened accounts, and took advantage of more than a million delivery drivers,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cCompanies cannot force workers into getting paid through accounts that drain their earnings with junk fees.\u201d\n\nThe CFPB\u2019s lawsuit against Walmart and Branch accuses the two companies of violating federal law for approximately two years starting in 2021.\n\nCFPB is also accusing Branch, which offers a deposit account at Evolve Bank & Trust that people can access through a digital app and debit card, of engaging in illegal activities related to consumer accounts, including illegally requiring consumers to waive their legal rights and failing to:\n\ninvestigate alleged errors,\n\nhonor stop payment requests,\n\nand maintain necessary records.\n\nWalmart pushed back on the CFPB\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u201cThe CFPB\u2019s rushed lawsuit is riddled with factual errors and contains exaggerations and blatant misstatements of settled principles of law. The CFPB never allowed Walmart a fair opportunity to present its case during their rushed investigation,\u201d a Walmart spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Thursday.\n\nIn a separate email, Branch claimed the CFPB\u2019s lawsuit \u201cmisstates the laws and facts\u201d in addition to including \u201cintentional omissions to mask the Bureau\u2019s clear overreach.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the company\u2019s extensive cooperation with its investigation, the CFPB refused to engage with Branch in any meaningful way about this matter, instead rushing to file a lawsuit. This approach makes clear that this litigation has nothing to do with the law or protecting workers and everything to do with the media attention garnered by a lawsuit involving one of the world\u2019s biggest retailers,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said in an email.\n\nThis lawsuit comes after a strong grocery e-commerce year for Walmart. The retailer hit a record high when it captured nearly 40% of grocery e-commerce spending in 2024\u2019s second quarter, according to Brick Meets Click and Mercatus.",

[Courtesy: DroneUp]\n\nWalmart and partner DroneUp boast one of the largest drone delivery services in the U.S. But after downsizing their network by more than half in August, the companies are going their separate ways.\n\nFirst reported by Axios and confirmed to FLYING by a Walmart spokesperson, the world\u2019s largest retailer has ended its contract with the drone delivery firm. In addition, Walmart, which as recently as June made an undisclosed strategic investment in the company, is no longer a DroneUp investor.\n\nDroneUp did not respond to FLYING\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDespite its name, DroneUp does not actually build or sell drones. Rather, the company supplies all of the infrastructure\u2014from autonomous loading, delivery, and flight planning systems to winches and batteries\u2014required to keep a drone delivery operation humming. Its hardware is designed to be installed directly on third-party drones and at customers\u2019 stores, allowing them to deliver food, groceries, retail items, and even medical supplies.\n\nDroneUp first caught the eye of Walmart in 2020, when the companies partnered to deliver COVID-19 test kits in New York and Nevada. The retailer deemed the trial successful enough to warrant an investment the following year.\n\nSince then, the partners\u2019 network has grown quickly. At the peak of their reach in 2022, they delivered more than 6,000 items out of 36 DroneUp hubs stationed at Walmart stores in seven states. And despite a few layoffs in 2023, DroneUp added to its offering with the rollout of a fully autonomous, end-to-end drone delivery system.\n\nIn August, though, the firm cut about 17 percent of its headcount. It also ceased service with Walmart in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa, Florida, leaving it with just 15 hubs.\n\nWalmart said it will continue to develop drone delivery even without DroneUp.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the momentum and positive customer response we\u2019ve experienced around drone delivery,\u201d the company said in a statement shared with FLYING. \u201cThis service will continue to evolve as we learn more about customer preferences and drone capabilities, and by focusing our efforts in Dallas-Fort Worth, we can learn more about the potential to scale this innovative delivery option for Walmart\u2019s customers.\u201d\n\nWalmart\u2019s partners in Dallas-Fort Worth\u2014Zipline and Wing, the drone delivery arm of Google parent Alphabet\u2014have the potential to be decent stand-ins for DroneUp. Both companies have introduced autonomous ecosystems for their own drones, including landing pads and package loading and delivery systems. With those developments, the massive retailer is getting more than just aircraft from DroneUp's competitors.\n\nTo boot, both Zipline and Wing have FAA authorization to manage their own airspace in Dallas-Fort Worth with agency oversight\u2014a historic approval that is allowing them to fly more freely than other drone operators.\n\nWalmart\u2019s reversal deals a blow to DroneUp. But like Zipline and Wing, the firm is an FAA-approved Part 135 air carrier, so it can offer potential customers the advantage of starting service quickly.\n\nAt the same time, DroneUp is contending with a problem faced by many in the drone delivery industry: unit economics. Put simply, it\u2019s too expensive to deliver by drone. DroneUp CEO Tom Walker in August told Axios it costs the firm about $30 to deliver a single package. The goal, Walker said, is to get that down to about $7.\n\nWalker\u2019s rationale for downsizing operations in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Tampa was that those services were too small. With the world\u2019s largest retailer no longer a customer, that uphill battle becomes steeper.",

The office will prioritize collaboration by providing flexible spaces for both small team meetings and larger group gatherings, fostering in-person teamwork.\n\nWalmart plans to move into the Bellevue office in late spring 2025.

Here's who to call in Corpus Christi.\n\nAn investigation is ongoing and a lawsuit has been filed in relation to the Nov. 24 incident in which a police officer fatally shot a man outside of a Corpus Christi Walmart.\n\nThe Corpus Christi Police Department reported that an off-duty Corpus Christi Independent School District officer confronted an individual in a vehicle about a suspected theft at the Westside Walmart Supercenter located on South Padre Island Drive. According to a news release from the Police Department, the officer, later identified as Andrea Bucher in documents from the civil case, fired shots after being dragged from the vehicle.\n\nAfter Bucher fell from the vehicle, it continued driving into a nearby field, according to the Police Department. Using drones, police found that Rodney Garcia, the individual inside the vehicle, was dead.\n\nOn Friday, about five weeks after the shooting, police Lt. Eryca Gonzalez said in an email that the department's Criminal Investigation Division is the investigating agency for the incident, but no updates on the case are available.\n\nBucher is employed by the CCISD Police Department, a separate agency from the Corpus Christi Police Department that is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of local schools. During the Nov. 24 incident, Bucher was working as security for Walmart.\n\nIn an email Monday, CCISD confirmed that Bucher is currently on paid administrative leave.\n\nOn Dec. 2, Garcia's mother, Rita Arambula, and his daughter, Gabriela Garcia, filed a civil lawsuit against Walmart and the officer, who had not yet been identified. The petition was amended on Dec. 11 to include Bucher's name.\n\nThe amended petition notes that while sitting in his car, Garcia was accused of having stolen from the store. It claims he was shot and killed \"despite having taken nothing from the store and being unarmed.\"\n\nThe amended petition claims that the store failed to ensure safety and adequate security, resulting in the use of excessive deadly force against Garcia. The family is seeking monetary relief for damages and requesting a jury trial.\n\nThe most recent developments in the case date to Dec. 23, when a request to subpoena records from the Corpus Christi Police Department was denied due to the ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nThe Nueces County District Attorney's Office could not be reached for comment.\n\nCorpus Christi police veteran to lead CLEAT, Texas' largest police labor union\n\nEverett Roy wins District 1 seat for Corpus Christi City Council after casting of lots\n\nMan, 71, dies after being hit by vehicle on Baldwin Boulevard, Corpus Christi police say",

            "content": "Walmart Ends DroneUp Partnership, Shifts Drone Delivery Strategy\n\nRetail giant Walmart has terminated its partnership with drone logistics provider DroneUp, including divesting its stake in the company, marking a significant shift in its drone delivery approach. The announcement comes shortly after DroneUp secured crucial FAA certification for expanded commercial operations.\n\nThe dissolution of this partnership, which began in 2021 following successful COVID-19 test kit delivery trials, highlights the persistent challenges facing commercial drone delivery services. Despite initial optimism, the venture encountered substantial operational costs and logistical hurdles that proved difficult to surmount. By August 2023, these challenges forced DroneUp to significantly reduce its operational footprint, ultimately restricting services to the Dallas market.\n\nHowever, Walmart\u2019s broader drone delivery ambitions remain intact. The company recently announced an expansion of its drone delivery services across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, partnering with established providers Wing and Zipline. This strategic pivot aims to serve up to 75% of the region, cementing Walmart\u2019s position as the U.S. retailer with the most extensive drone delivery network.\n\nThe retail sector\u2019s continued experimentation with drone delivery technology reflects both its potential and persistent challenges. While DroneUp received its anticipated FAA certification, the economics of sustainable drone delivery operations remain complex. A DroneUp spokesperson indicated the company would not cease operations entirely but would redirect its focus toward other initiatives.\n\nThis development occurs against the backdrop of evolving Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) regulations and ongoing industry efforts to establish economically viable drone delivery services. The challenges faced by the Walmart-DroneUp partnership underscore the importance of scalable operations and sustainable cost structures in the emerging drone delivery sector.\n\nThe transition from experimental programs to commercially viable services continues to present significant hurdles for the drone delivery industry. While technical capabilities advance and regulatory frameworks evolve, establishing profitable operations at scale remains a central challenge. Walmart\u2019s strategic shift toward partnerships with Wing and Zipline suggests that different operational models and technological approaches may be necessary to achieve viable commercial drone delivery services.\n\nIndustry analysts will be watching closely to see how DroneUp leverages its newly acquired FAA certification in its future endeavors, and how Walmart\u2019s partnerships with Wing and Zipline might overcome the obstacles that challenged its previous drone delivery initiatives.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nShare this: Print\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\nThreads\n\nWhatsApp\n\nMastodon\n\nX\n\n",

Walmart's Spark program uses gig workers who make deliveries from Walmart stores nationwide on so-called \u201clast mile\u201d deliveries.\n\nCFPB also claims that Walmart and Branch misled workers about the availability of same-day access to their earnings. It said that the drivers had to follow a complex process to access their funds, and when they finally did, they faced further delays or fees if they needed to transfer the money they earned into an account of their choice.\n\nThe practice resulted in workers paying more than $10 million in fees, the agency said.\n\n\u201cWalmart made false promises, illegally opened accounts, and took advantage of more than a million delivery drivers,\u201d said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a statement released Dec. 23. \u201cCompanies cannot force workers into getting paid through accounts that drain their earnings with junk fees.\u201d\n\nIn a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Friday, a Walmart spokesperson called the lawsuit \u201crushed\" and said it was \u201driddled with factual errors and contains exaggerations and blatant misstatements of settled principles of law. \"\n\n\u201cThe CFPB never allowed Walmart a fair opportunity to present its case during their rushed investigation,\" the statement said. \u201cWe look forward to vigorously defending the company before a court that, unlike the CFPB, honors the due process of law.\u201d\n\nBranch, based in Minneapolis, said in an emailed statement to The AP that it strongly disagrees with the lawsuit filed by the CFPB, which Branch said misstates the law and facts, and includes intentional omissions to mask the bureau\u2019s clear overreach.\n\n\u201cBranch has provided Walmart and their driver partners valuable services allowing quick and easy access to funds via their business accounts\u2014a key fact the bureau\u2019s press release omits,\u201d the statement said.",

            "content": "We didn\u2019t forget you, you bastards. (Photo: Getty)\n\nWalmart is, and has long been, the biggest private sector employer in America. It has more than two million employees. A couple of decades ago, Walmart was, in the public mind, what Amazon is today: the big, bad symbol of a McJob, the gargantuan employer of last resort that was swallowing up the American workplace. Amazon\u2019s internet roots and its ability to drive the entire retail sector towards online shopping has allowed it to replace Walmart as the dystopian image of The Future of Work. But Amazon still has 600,000 fewer employees. Walmart has never gone away\u2014it just managed to clean up its reputation.\n\nCommon sense tells you that the biggest employer in the country is one of (if not the) most vital targets for organized labor. And for many years, Walmart was. The UFCW, the main grocery industry union, spent a ton of money on what was more of a PR and legislative campaign against Walmart than a straight union organizing campaign, and never managed to win any unions. The company, viciously anti-union since day one, once eliminated its meat-cutting department at 180 stores after meat cutters at a single store in Texas unionized.\n\nToday, Amazon has become the Massive Company We Must Unionize, and for good reason\u2014it probably does more to affect how more Americans will be working in coming years than anyone else. And the Teamsters, fresh off a wave of Christmas strikes, are having some tentative success, though organizing Amazon is a task that, even if it goes well, will be continuing for the rest of my lifetime. But somehow, Walmart feels as if it escaped; from organized labor\u2019s crosshairs, from the harsh glare of public attention, and from its own bad reputation.\n\nBesides allowing Amazon to conveniently take the heat off of it, one way that Walmart pulled off this neat trick was by pouring money into PR efforts to burnish its reputation. (I was working at PRWeek Magazine when the massive PR firm Edelman began its lucrative task of putting a friendly face on Walmart. If you work at Edelman you need to quit your evil job.) Part of this has been a huge effort to put itself at the forefront of corporate America\u2019s \u201csustainability\u201d campaign. Another part has been an effort to win the intellectual battle over whether Walmart itself is a net good for the communities where its stores land.\n\nInstinctively, you know what happens when a Walmart opens outside a small town: It becomes the biggest store in town, with the lowest prices, as well as the biggest employer. All the small stores downtown, unable to compete on price, slowly go out of business, a process that only strengthens Walmart\u2019s position as the only place to work. First, use your scale to put your local competitors out of business; then, pay low wages, because where else are your workers going to go? In time, all small town character dissolves in the face of Walmart\u2019s economic obliteration machine.\n\nThe counter to this argument, from Walmart\u2019s allies, has long been that the money that Walmart saves consumers is worth all that other stuff. By being huge and squeezing its suppliers for every last penny and relentlessly cutting prices, they said, Walmart becomes the consumer\u2019s greatest ally. It\u2019s hard to know precisely how to weigh the sides of this argument. Still, all of it has been plausible enough to make Walmart respectable again. Christ, Hillary Clinton was a Walmart board member.\n\nI mention all this because it now is possible to say how the scales balance in terms of Walmart\u2019s effect on public welfare. As Rog\u00e9 Karma lays out in this excellent story in The Atlantic, meticulous new economic research shows that the opening of a Walmart causes incomes to decline in the community where the store opens by more than the amount that shoppers save at Walmart. One research paper says that the average net loss from a Walmart\u2019s opening is about $2,000 per year per person, leading to a 16% increase in poverty locally.\n\nMake Walmart politically toxic again.\n\nAnother paper, by Justin Wiltshire, confirms the mechanism of that damage:\n\nI first show Supercenter entry sharply increased labor market concentration. Supercenters were able to hire large numbers of retail workers with zero increase in average earnings, indicating Walmart had wage-setting power. I then show Supercenter entry caused large declines in overall local employment and earnings, particularly among local goods-producers, indicating Walmart displaced manufacturing demand away from local producers and to its own national and international suppliers.\n\nIn other words, your common sense instincts were correct: Walmart opens a store, puts local stores out of business, which causes the suppliers of local stores to suffer as well, which reduces employment options locally, which forces people to work at Walmart, which then has the power to keep wages low. And Walmart\u2019s low prices do not outweigh the damage from its power to screw workers and small businesses.\n\nFuck you, Walmart. We were right about you fucks all along.\n\nWith that in mind, I would like to gently suggest that the fact that there is not a major effort by organized labor to unionize Walmart is, you know, insane. The largest employer in America. Proven to drive down wages and keep communities poor. Owned by the richest fucking family in America, all of whom should be held by the ankles and shaken until their collective $267 billion net worth falls out of their pockets and into the pockets of the millions of workers that they extracted it from.\n\nI do not want to minimize how difficult organizing Walmart would be. Besides the corporate union-busting built into every level of the company, it is always, always hard to successfully unionize large workplaces of low-wage workers with high turnover in areas where people are economically desperate. On the other hand, look at the Starbucks campaign: 500 stores unionized at a large, national low-wage employer. And look at the state of the Amazon organizing campaign: Years of effort with very scattered success have finally come together under the auspices of a major union which appears ready to professionalize the fight and keep banging on the company until they actually secure at least one union contract, which will serve as a launching point for more union contracts. It is still early, but those two campaigns are demonstrations that things can be done in places that have some similar characteristics to Walmart, if enough effort is applied.\n\nDonate to our reporting fund\n\nIn fact, Walmart is probably easier to unionize than Amazon. Where Amazon has warehouses in out-of-the-way locations, Walmart has physical stores, with huge foot traffic. Where do you think a picket line would get more bang for the buck? Walmart\u2019s nature as a physical retail establishment makes it more susceptible to picketing and protests, more susceptible to bad PR, more susceptible to local political and community fights than Amazon. Both are hard. Both are important. But if unions can, ever so slowly, get their roots into Amazon, they can do it at Walmart too.\n\nWalmart is the largest grocery store chain in America. The UFCW has long understood that it is hard to maintain labor power in the grocery industry if the largest player in the whole fucking industry is union-free and can undercut every other company on prices and wages. Although UFCW has a lot of money (which it does not bother to spend on organizing), the truth is that Walmart is too big for any single union to meaningfully tackle on its own. It (along with Amazon, and the big tech companies, and the big union-free national retail chains that trap hundreds of thousands of American workers in permanent poverty) is ripe for the creation of a strategic, national, multi-union organizing campaign. That is the sort of thing that the labor movement would do if it had its shit together, which it does not.\n\nOther than spreading the word about the new economic research, nothing I\u2019m saying here is in any way novel. The lay of the land here is pretty well understood. The new year, though, is a good opportunity for those of us in the labor movement to stop lying to ourselves. Will we have a resurgence of worker power in America if we have zero, nada, no union presence at the biggest fucking employer in the country? No. Come on now. Unionizing Walmart will be hard. Unionizing Walmart will take a long time. The first step is to start. Two million workers will thank you.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nMore",

Some fresh vegetables were up even more at 2.9%.\n\nWALMART BEATS WALL STREET EXPECTATIONS, RAISES OUTLOOK AS IT OFFERS MORE GROCERY DISCOUNTS\n\nThe company has been building new modernized stores and remodeling hundreds of others. Over the past three years, it remodeled about 700 stores each year on average, and it plans to convert more in the coming year. The company's new and updated stores include improved layouts, bigger product selection, refreshed signs, paint and shopping carts.\n\nAside from its improved aesthetic, Rainey also credited its private brand as another driver. Walmart is seeing an increase in private brands as a larger share of overall sales, driven partly by consumers\u2019 focus on price during high inflation. Earlier this year, the company launched its latest and most expansive private label brand, Bettergoods, which encompasses 300 items including frozen, dairy, snacks, beverages, pasta, soups, coffee and chocolate.\n\nNot only is the company offering a more expansive selection of food within the private label, but the quality of the food has improved as well, Rainey said.\n\n\"It's much broader and appeals to a lot more customers and members,\" Rainey said, adding that \"the quality is just much different than what you've seen historically.\"\n\nHe also highlighted that consumers\u2019 growing reliance on convenience is benefiting Walmart. According to Rainey, one-third of their customers are paying extra for expedited food delivery through Walmart\u2019s delivery services.\n\nWalmart shares rose over 70% last year, far outpacing the S&P 500's 20%+ rise.\n\nWalmart\n\nSOME WALMART EMPLOYEES WEARING BODY CAMERAS IN STORES FOR SAFETY\n\nThis comes as the $25 billion merger between Albertsons and Kroger crumbled amid concerns from federal regulators that the deal would undermine competition in the grocery industry. The deal would have been the largest merger in the history of the grocery industry.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % ACI ALBERTSONS COMPANIES 21.08 -0.11 -0.52% KR THE KROGER CO. 65.10 -1.01 -1.53%\n\nHowever, U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson said that the plan put forward by the two companies to reduce grocery prices and divest more than 500 stores failed to address concerns about reduced competition in the sector and the impact it could have on consumers and workers.\n\nAlbertsons, which subsequently sued Kroger for not working hard enough to secure the merger, claimed the deal would have expanded competition, lowered prices, increased associate wages, protected union jobs and enhanced customers\u2019 shopping experience.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAs of September, Albertsons Companies operated 2,267 retail food and drug stores with 1,726 pharmacies, 405 associated fuel centers, 22 dedicated distribution centers and 19 manufacturing facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Kroger operates 2,750 grocery retail stores under a variety of banner names, including Kroger, Ralphs, Dillons, Smith\u2019s, King Soopers and Fred Meyer.\n\nIn the U.S., Walmart operates just over 4,600 stores. This does not include its membership warehouse, Sam's Club, which houses about 600 locations around the nation.",

Walmart\u2019s Spark program uses gig workers who make deliveries from Walmart stores nationwide on so-called \u201clast mile\u201d deliveries.\n\nCFPB also claims that Walmart and Branch misled workers about the availability of same-day access to their earnings. It said that the drivers had to follow a complex process to access their funds, and when they finally did, they faced further delays or fees if they needed to transfer the money they earned into an account of their choice.\n\nThe practice resulted in workers paying more than $10 million in fees, the agency said.\n\n\u201cWalmart made false promises, illegally opened accounts, and took advantage of more than a million delivery drivers,\u201d said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a statement released Dec. 23. \u201cCompanies cannot force workers into getting paid through accounts that drain their earnings with junk fees.\u201d\n\nIn a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Friday, a Walmart spokesperson called the lawsuit \u201crushed\u201d and said it was \u201driddled with factual errors and contains exaggerations and blatant misstatements of settled principles of law. \u201c\n\n\u201cThe CFPB never allowed Walmart a fair opportunity to present its case during their rushed investigation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe look forward to vigorously defending the company before a court that, unlike the CFPB, honors the due process of law.\u201d\n\nBranch, based in Minneapolis, said in an emailed statement to The AP that it strongly disagrees with the lawsuit filed by the CFPB, which Branch said misstates the law and facts, and includes intentional omissions to mask the bureau\u2019s clear overreach.\n\n\u201cBranch has provided Walmart and their driver partners valuable services allowing quick and easy access to funds via their business accounts\u2014a key fact the bureau\u2019s press release omits,\u201d the statement said.",

But the company is concerned consumers may still have the recalled products at home.\n\nWe've got the news you need to know to start your day. Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter \u2014 delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.\n\nThere haven't been any illnesses reported in relation to the recall, but out of caution, Braga Fresh is recalling its products and alerting consumers. If you purchased any of the recalled items, you should discard them and refrain from eating them.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, there was another recall affecting different broccoli products and vegetables sold at Walmart. That recall also included some Marketside branded items, but was issued due to possible contamination with E. coli.\n\nThe new recall is in response to concerns that the bagged broccoli florets could be contaminated with listeria, a different type of bacteria.\n\nListeria is a bacteria that causes food-borne illness. While listeria infections are typically mild and cause symptoms like diarrhea, the illness can be more severe. And those who are pregnant, older adults, newborns and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop serious complications from listeria.\n\nWhich broccoli products are recalled?\n\nThis recall only affects 12-ounce bags of Marketside Broccoli Florets.\n\nThe affected items have a \"best if used by\" date of Dec. 10, 2024. While this date has passed and the product is no longer in stores, there is concern that consumers who purchased the broccoli may still have it in their homes. Anyone who has the recalled broccoli florets should not eat them and instead discard the product.\n\nIf the product is included in the recall, it will also show the product UPC code \"6 81131 32884 5\" and lot code \"BFFG327A6.\"\n\nWhere was the recalled broccoli sold?\n\nThe recalled bagged broccoli was sold at Walmart stores in these 20 states:\n\nAlaska\n\nArkanas\n\nArizona\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nIdaho\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMichigan\n\nMontana\n\nNevada\n\nOhio\n\nOklahoma\n\nOregon\n\nTexas\n\nUtah\n\nWashington\n\nWyoming\n\nListeria symptoms\n\nListeria is a type of bacteria that, when ingested, can cause an illness called listeriosis.\n\nThere are two types of listeriosis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explain, including intestinal illness and invasive illness.\n\nAn intestinal listeria infection tends to cause mild symptoms that are similar to those of other food-borne illnesses, such as diarrhea and vomiting. These symptoms typically start within 24 hours of eating the contaminated food and resolve within three days, per the CDC.\n\nHowever, some people who get intestinal listeriosis go on to develop a more severe and invasive illness that spreads beyond the intestines, the CDC explains. People who are pregnant, older adults, newborns and those with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of invasive listeria can include:\n\nFever\n\nMuscle aches\n\nFatigue\n\nHeadache\n\nStiff neck\n\nLoss of balance\n\nSeizures\n\nConfusion\n\nHowever, in pregnant people, invasive listeria may only present with a fever and flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle aches. In rare cases, invasive listeria can lead to death.\n\nInvasive listeria can cause more severe consequences, including miscarriage or stillbirth for pregnant people. So it's important to know the signs of listeria and avoid contaminated food whenever possible.\n\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com. More from Today:",

And with the increase in value, that has pushed its valuation up to a market cap of around $730 billion.\n\nBelow, I'll look at how likely it is for Walmart's stock to join the $1 trillion club in 2025 based on its fundamentals, growth prospects, and valuation.\n\nBusiness has been steady and a potential growth catalyst is coming\n\nWalmart's performance this past year hasn't been exceptional; sales haven't been skyrocketing by double digits as if it were a hot growth stock again. But simply finding ways to grow its business by single-digit percentages is impressive these days as many retailers have been fighting to keep customers. Rising costs are turning people away and even discount retailers are struggling.\n\nWalmart, however, has been a resilient retailer. A big part of it is likely it being an easy one-stop shop for consumers, who appreciate being able to buy groceries and day-to-day essentials in one place. And with discount retailers even having to raise prices due to inflation, consumers may not see a benefit to going to their local dollar store anymore when the savings compared to Walmart may be negligible or non-existent.\n\nThrough the first nine months of fiscal 2025, ended Oct. 31, Walmart's sales rose by over 5% to $500.4 billion. The company's operating income during that period also rose by nearly 9% to $21.5 billion. These aren't numbers that are going to make it the next hot growth stock, but the stability of Walmart's results is what may be attracting investors' attention these days.\n\nPlus, a catalyst to watch out for is the impact the recent acquisition of TV maker Vizio may have on its business. Walmart wrapped up the deal in early December and it gives the company a way to reach customers through Vizio's SmartCast platform, which has more than 19 million active accounts. It's a big opportunity for Walmart to expand its advertising business into streaming and rake in more sales.\n\nHas Walmart's valuation gotten too expensive?\n\nOne possible impediment to the stock's growth may be Walmart's valuation. Any time a stock rises so much so quickly, it inevitably ends up trading at a premium. Currently, Walmart's stock is trading at 37 times its trailing earnings. Here's how that compares to some other top retail stocks.\n\nWalmart's stock is on the higher end of this group, with Costco Wholesale being the only one investors are paying more of a premium for.\n\nThe question for investors is whether the premium is justifiable. On one hand, the business is growing steadily, its profits are rising, and it has an exciting new growth opportunity due to the Vizio acquisition; on the other hand, it's not generating the type of growth investors might expect for a stock that's trading at such a high earnings multiple. I think Walmart deserves a bit of a premium, but the bullishness in the markets has pushed it to a price tag that might be a bit too rich right now.\n\nWalmart will likely hit $1 trillion, but probably not this year\n\nFor Walmart to reach a $1 trillion market cap, it would need to rise by 37% from where it is today. That would likely mean another strong year of outperforming the market by a wide margin. While the company still has many growth opportunities to pursue, barring a substantial increase in earnings this year, investors will probably have to pay an even higher multiple for Walmart's stock for it to reach $1 trillion, which is ultimately why I don't think it will happen in 2025.\n\nIf you're a long-term investor, you can still do well by buying shares of Walmart today and just hanging on. It's a quality investment and there's a lot more growth ahead. But I think the market is due for a bit of a slowdown and while Walmart's stock is coming off a fantastic performance this past year, I wouldn't be surprised to see much milder returns over the next 12 months.",

According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), thousands of drivers had their wages deposited into a Branch account without being consented first.\n\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n\nWalmart allegedly told the drivers that they would be terminated if they did not want to use the Branch accounts.\n\nWhen drivers did use the platform, they allegedly faced numerous delays or fees if they needed to transfer money from the Branch account into a different account, which resulted in more than $10 million in added \u201cjunk fees.\u201d\n\nIf drivers wanted an \u201cinstant\u201d transfer to a different bank, these fees would add either 2 percent or $2.99 per transaction, whichever was higher, the complaint said.\n\nDrivers could use a second option that didn\u2019t include a fee, but that could take up to five days and was only available if the receiving account was at a bank that partnered with the same financial data transfer company Branch used.\n\nFor both options, Branch also imposed daily and monthly limits on how much money Spark drivers could transfer out of their accounts.\n\nSpark delivery workers have complained about the lack of better payment options, as the Branch Messenger account requirements don\u2019t enable direct deposit to a preferred credit union or local bank.\n\nSince August 2021, Walmart and Branch opened Branch accounts for more than 1 million drivers in the Spark program, which is Walmart\u2019s platform for gig economy workers that fulfill last-mile deliveries from the retail giant\u2019s stores.\n\nWalmart and Branch opened accounts for new drivers by using drivers\u2019 information, including their social security numbers, without obtaining the drivers\u2019 consent, the 60-page suit alleges. Drivers\u2019 pay was then deposited into these accounts without their authorization. Drivers could not access their earnings without agreeing to Branch\u2019s terms and conditions.\n\nThe suit also says the defendants misrepresented to drivers that they had instant access to earnings or same-day pay via the Branch account. Spark drivers have never received same-day pay through Branch, the suit said.",

            "content": "\u201cFashionistas are clamoring to get their hands on a \u2018Walmart Birkin,\u2019 also known as a \u201cWirkin,\u201d the New York Post reported this weekend, referring to an inexpensive handbag that looks a whole lot like Herm\u00e8s\u2019 most coveted offering. Ranging from $78 to $102 depending on the size of the bag, the \u201cWalmart Birkin\u201d has garnered viral status online so much so that it has sold out on the retail giant\u2019s site on more than one occasion. TikTok users and the media, alike, have been quick to label the bag a \u201cdupe,\u201d a term that typically refers to legally-above-board products that replicate the look of high-priced goods \u2014 sans any legally-protectable elements. But is the \u201cWalmart Birkin\u201d actually in the clear from a legal point of view? Probably not.\n\nOne version of the Birkin bag that is being offered up on Walmart\u2019s e-commerce marketplace (via a third-party seller) does not make use of Herm\u00e8s\u2019 name on the bag, itself; on a real Birkin, Herm\u00e8s\u2019 name appears on the body of the bag underneath the flap, inside the bag, and on various hardware. At the same time, the discount replica also does not copy Herm\u00e8s\u2019 trademark-protected \u201cH\u201d logo, which appears on the lock on an authentic Birkin bag. Still yet, the listing for the \u201cGenuine Leather Handbags Purse for Women Tote Shoulder Bag\u201d from a third-party seller called KAMUGO, for example, does not make use of the Herm\u00e8s name or \u201cBirkin\u201d word mark.\n\n> Other offerings, such as one from third-party company Sulikehz, make use of the \u201cBirkin\u201d and \u201cHerm\u00e8s\u201d word marks, giving rise to potential trademark issues.\n\nThe KAMUGO-made bag and others like it are almost certainly still running afoul of the law because the look of the Birkin bag, itself, is protected \u2013 with or without the inclusion of the Herm\u00e8s word marks. Yes, in addition to its rights in the BIRKIN name, Herm\u00e8s has a monopoly of sorts in the distinctive shape of the bag. In other words, Herm\u00e8s has rights in the Birkin bag trade dress, which consists of \u2026\n\n\u201cThe configuration of a handbag, having rectangular sides a rectangular bottom, and a dimpled triangular profile. The top of the bag consists of a rectangular flap having three protruding lobes, between which are two keyhole-shaped openings that surround the base of the handles. Over the flap is a horizontal rectangular strap having an opening to receive a padlock eye. A lock in the shape of a padlock forms the clasp for the bag at the center of the strap\u201d \u2026 for use on handbags.\n\nWith the foregoing in mind, the question becomes one of confusion. If Herm\u00e8s were to wage a trademark infringement claim against KAMUGO (the company behind the bag) for offering it up for sale and selling it and Walmart for facilitating its sale, the critical inquiry would be whether consumers are likely to be confused about the source of the handbag and/or Herm\u00e8s affiliation/endorsement of the bag in light of its near-exact appearance. There are several factors that would weigh in Herm\u00e8s\u2019 favor in such an analysis; in addition to the strength of the Herm\u00e8s\u2019 Birkin trade dress and the obvious intent to trade on the appeal of/demand for the Birkin bag, there is the fact that third-party sellers offer up purportedly authentic Birkin bags on Walmart\u2019s marketplace.\n\nA quick search of the e-commerce platform reveals that dozens of potentially authentic, pre-owned Birkins are available for purchase for price tags of $15,000-plus. This could enable Herm\u00e8s to bolster its as-of-now-hypothetical trademark infringement claim by arguing that consumers are more likely to be confused given that there are (potentially) authentic Herm\u00e8s bags available on Walmart\u2019s site.\n\nOn the flip side, Walmart and the third-party sellers could highlight the eye-watering difference between the price tags of the allegedly infringing bags ($100 or less for) with the price tag of real ones, which routinely sell for $10,000 or more on the secondary market, to maintain that consumers are unlikely to confuse the two. In addition to the very-different prices of the bags, the hypothetical defendants could probably also argue that the marketing and distribution channels for real Birkin bags and the allegedly infringing ones are very different, weighing against the likelihood of consumer confusion. It is here that Herm\u00e8s could counter, at least in part, and point to the robust resale market for its most sought-after bags and the resulting lack of clear lines between formerly distinct distribution channels.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of an infringement claim, Herm\u00e8s would also have a dilution cause of action on its hands given the level of fame of its Birkin bag trade dress. As distinct from trademark infringement, which centers on likelihood of confusion, a trademark dilution claim enables the owner of a truly famous mark to bar unauthorized use of that mark regardless of whether consumers might be deceived about its source in order to prevent a lessening of its distinctiveness or tarnishing of the goodwill associated with the mark.\n\nChances are, in the wake of the widespread media attention to the fake Birkins being offered up on Walmart\u2019s marketplace, the listing will disappear. Herm\u00e8s will undoubtedly initiate takedown proceedings with Walmart. As for whether it will take action against the individual sellers, many of which appear to be based on China, and/or Walmart, to prevent future sales and/or seek damages, stay tuned.",

Valdosta Police Officers arrived at the scene within two minutes of the call being dispatched and observed LC Strawder, 18 years of age, in possession of a rifle, physically fighting with a male. While officers were separating the two males and attempting to secure the firearm, two other males, Shamariun Morrison, 17 years of age, and Artis Thomas, 30 years of age, began to fight physically and officers had to separate them.\n\nThrough investigation, officers determined that the victim and his family were walking out of Walmart. Strawder, who knows the victim, observed him walking to his vehicle. Strawder started a confrontation with the victim by spitting on him and pointing the rifle at him. This resulted in the victim attempting to grab the gun, which resulted in the two males physically fighting over the rifle.\n\nAs officers were gathering statements and determining what occurred, a relative of Strawder\u2019s, Shamariun Morrison attempted to start fighting with the victim.

Strawder has been charged with aggravated assault (felony). Morrison and Thomas were charged with affray (misdemeanor).\n\nThe case is still under investigation and further charges are pending.\n\n\u201cWe had numerous innocent people and children shopping at a busy store in the middle of the day when this 18-year-old decided to confront a person he knows, with a rifle.

            "content": "The overview: Walmart is flying high. The retailer\u2019s reputation as a destination for cost savings is fueling steady growth as more shoppers across all income levels turn to it for everyday needs. At the same time, the company is challenging Amazon\u2019s ecommerce dominance with investments in fast delivery, its Walmart+ program, and its rapidly expanding online marketplace.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at some of Walmart\u2019s notable achievements in the past year.\n\nWalmart made inroads with a broad swath of shoppers. Customers of all income levels are turning to Walmart more often thanks to its low prices, convenience, and rapidly expanding marketplace.\n\nThree-quarters of the retailer\u2019s share gains in 2024 came from higher-income consumers visiting Walmart for groceries and general merchandise like apparel. They\u2019re also willing to pay more for faster delivery options.\n\nWalmart is courting those customers with a broader array of premium products across a number of categories, including grocery, beauty , and apparel.\n\n, and apparel. The retailer is also broadening its appeal to shoppers via its marketplace, which has expanded its assortment by nearly 700 million SKUs. Those efforts are paying off: Marketplace sales grew 42% YoY in Q3, the fifth-straight quarter of growth over 30%.\n\nWalmart went all in on generative AI (genAI). The retailer made its ambitions clear in January, when it beat Amazon to the punch by rolling out genAI-enhanced search capabilities to mobile shoppers.\n\nSince then, Walmart has launched several genAI-powered features to make the shopping experience more personalized and useful to customers, including:\n\nA shopping assistant that can answer shoppers\u2019 questions and direct them to relevant products\n\nAI-generated product reviews, summaries, and comparisons to help customers decide which items best fulfill their needs\n\nAnd a customer support assistant that can identify who the shopper is from the start and take actions like find orders and manage returns\u2014leading to better, faster customer service\n\nAll of those improvements are in service of Walmart\u2019s broader goal: tailoring the customer experience based on shoppers\u2019 wants, needs, and preferences\u2014no matter how they choose to shop. By offering consumers convenience, personalization, and a seamless omnichannel experience, the retailer hopes to become their first port of call in their shopping journeys.\n\nThe retailer made big advertising moves, most notably its $2.3 billion acquisition of smart TV manufacturer Vizio. That deal gives Walmart entry into the lucrative world of CTV advertising, which provides a new revenue stream and makes its Walmart Connect retail media network more attractive to advertisers.\n\nOther notable advertising updates this year include:\n\nPartnering with Disney Advertising so brands can target ads across Disney+ and Hulu using its shopper data\n\nso brands can target ads across and using its shopper data Teaming up with NBCUniversal for shoppable ads during live sports, including the Thanksgiving Day NFL game\n\nfor shoppable ads during live sports, including the Thanksgiving Day NFL game Opening up offsite media to non-endemic brands\n\nLetting third-party sellers purchase onsite display placements on its web and mobile properties for the first time\n\nThose initiatives enabled Walmart to grow ad revenues by 31.6% this year to $3.87 billion, per our forecast ; we expect the retailer to maintain its heady momentum in 2025 thanks to increased ad spend from its marketplace sellers and growing interest in in-store retail media.\n\nThe year ahead: Walmart is in an extremely favorable position heading into 2025. Its reputation for value is helping make its offerings stickier for households of all income levels\u2014which in turn is accelerating its ecommerce and advertising businesses.",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nBudget-conscious buyers looking for luxury alternatives have flocked to Walmart\u2019s Birkin bag look-alike, nicknamed the \u201cWirkin.\u201d\n\nThe leather handbag available on Walmart\u2019s website is a more affordable alternative to French luxury goods maker Herm\u00e8s\u2019 Birkin bag. Many Wirkins appear to have sold out after buzz on social media.\n\nLuxury brands like Herm\u00e8s have remained in the public eye, but their prices put them out of reach for most people. Nonetheless, bargain-hungry shoppers love indulging \u2014 making cheaper, high-quality duplicates appealing.\n\nFashion influencers also play into the hype of these look-alikes, which the rise of online shopping and cheap shipping prices, even from halfway across the world, have made more accessible than ever.\n\nHerm\u00e8s doesn\u2019t sell its bag online, but Maison de Luxe, a Los Angeles-based company that sells brand new and pre-owned Herm\u00e8s bags, lists Birkin bags between $26,500 and $399,999. A \u201cstandard model\u201d Birkin, which takes up to 40 hours to make by hand by a single artisan, can start at around $7,200 according to SACL\u00c0B, a Munich-based marketplace.\n\nWould-be Birkin buyers filed a lawsuit in March alleging that to buy a Birkin bag they first needed to purchase other Hermes accessories and items, effectively adding to the cost to snag one of the high-profile handbags.\n\nOn the flip side, the Walmart Birkin that has gained traction sells for as little as $78, depending on size and color. Kamugo, the maker of one Wirkin, says the purse is made with genuine cowhide leather but uses synthetic leather inside of the bag.\n\nKamugo isn\u2019t the only brand to take a shot at Birkin dupes \u2014 BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy are a few other brands listed on Walmart\u2019s site that sell similar totes.\n\n\u201cThe Walmart Birkin bag is called a Wirkin and it\u2019s for the Wirkin class,\u201d a TikTok user wrote.\n\nWalmart did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMissing out on consumers\n\nThe Birkin handbag is an example of a luxury item with a reputation for exclusivity. Many celebrities \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9, Cardi B and the Kardashian family are all devotees \u2014 sing about and post photos of their Birkin collections. A Birkin bag made of crocodile skin sold for nearly $390,000 at auction during the pandemic. The tote was originally designed with space for baby bottles for British actress Jane Birkin in 1984, who needed a spacious bag as a young mother, according to Hermes\u2019 website.\n\nHerm\u00e8s is one of the top luxury goods companies by sales, which improved by 32% in 2022 \u2014 boosted by new stores in New York and Austin, Texas, according to a Deloitte report. The company\u2019s leather goods and saddlery products, primarily led by the Birkin bag, accounted for 42.8% of the company\u2019s revenue in 2022, Deloitte reported.\n\n\u201c\u2026Hermes is laughing in yalls face making you jump through hoops to give them tens of thousands of dollars?? no!!\u201d wrote a user on X, who added that the Walmart bag looks good as well.\n\nHigh-end handbags are among the most frequently purchased secondhand fashion categories. Walmart also sells pre-owned Birkin bags online, which run for thousands of dollars, among a number of sites selling used Birkins and other luxury items.\n\nConsulting giant McKinsey & Co. recommends that luxury fashion executives recognize the importance of a large swath of their customer base: those who buy at least one luxury item a year and spend between $3,000 and $10,000 annually.\n\nThese consumers account for half of luxury brands\u2019 revenue. Only about 30% of these buyers make decisions based on logos, according to McKinsey & Co.\n\nWalmart and Kamugo may have inadvertently tapped into that consumer base by providing another version of the handbag.\n\n\u201cWalmart has given them entry, like \u2018here you go, here it is.\u2019 It\u2019s a similar shape, this one is more functional for your cross-body moms and you are allowed to do this\u2026,\u201d reality TV star Bethenny Frankel posted on TikTok.\n\n\u2018Dupe\u2019 culture takes over\n\nHerm\u00e8s isn\u2019t the only brand having its products duplicated \u2014 Stanley water bottles, Skims bodysuits and Lululemon leggings are among pricey brands facing competition from affordable lookalikes.\n\nHerm\u00e8s did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cDupes,\u201d which are less expensive alternatives to household name brands without tacking on fake logos (meaning the item isn\u2019t considered counterfeit, despite marked similarities to pricier originals), have racked up more attention online in recent years.\n\nSteven Moy, chief client officer at luxury consultant G & Co., said dupes are inevitable. It\u2019s reminiscent of how automakers Toyota and Honda received pushback for their luxury models, Lexus and Acura.\n\nSome consumers have waited years for a Birkin bag, he said. Moy added that wealthy consumers, who are loyal to luxury brands like Herm\u00e8s, won\u2019t stop shopping because of these duplicates.\n\n\u201cThe true ultra luxury, in that case, won\u2019t be affected in the short run,\u201d Moy said.\n\nSome brands, like Lululemon, have hit back at dupes. The athleisure brand hosted a \u201cdupe swap\u201d in Los Angeles, promising its black Align High Rise Pant 25\u201d in exchange for a duplicate pair.\n\nSocial media users have questioned whether buying a look-alike makes much sense, with one TikTok user saying \u201cwouldn\u2019t buy a fake one because I don\u2019t even care to have a real one.\u201d\n\nThe dupe manufacturers often operate without much transparency, and many brands don\u2019t have a clear store origin. Kamugo, for example, doesn\u2019t appear to have a website.\n\nMoy says accessories like the Wirkin and fast-fashion companies make luxury accessible, especially for younger crowds who may eventually shop at luxury brands.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong answer. It depends on what audience you want to serve,\u201d Moy said. \u201cDo they want to reach those audiences or do you want to keep your core audience?\u201d",

More than 17,000 of the job postings paid less than $50,000 annually. Over 9,000 job ads advertised incomes of $70,000 or more, while about 5,400 job ads listed salaries between $50,000 and $69,000. Nearly 60% of all the job listings had no salary information posted.\n\nRegistered nurses, retail salespeople, supervisors of retail salespeople, heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers, and customer service representatives were the five professions with the most job postings on the internet. In November, Huntsville Hospital had the most online job postings, followed by Walmart. Jack\u2019s Family Restaurants, Taco Bell, and UAB Medicine rounded out the top five companies that publish the most job openings online.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaco Bell Claims AI Will Streamline Its Work\n\nFolks who are worried about AI taking their jobs don\u2019t have to worry at Taco Bell now that the fast-food giant has implemented an AI protocol nationwide. The Tex-Mex-inspired restaurant says that the new technology will supplement and streamline the work, not take it away.\n\nAccording to KRCR, the local ABC affiliate in central California, its anchors tested the AI deployment at their neighborhood Taco Bell, and the outcomes were positive for both patrons and staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping me out. I used to have to double task to do both jobs taking cash and taking orders and now she does a really good job and she\u2019s learning so it actually helps me out when I\u2019m in the window,\u201d said an employee.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, the team ordered 15 items, and the AI order-taker correctly identified every item. In a news release, Taco Bell promised both its customers and staff that its AI ordering technology would streamline the process and help personnel save time.\n\nCustomers who drive up to place an order should expect to speak with a machine rather than a live person. This is a result of the summer announcement by Taco Bell\u2019s parent company, Yum! Brands, that it would implement artificial intelligence speech technology in its drive-thrus in hundreds of U.S. locations by the end of the year.",

Walmart told Spark Drivers that they were required to use Branch to get paid and that they would terminate workers who did not want to use these accounts. Walmart and Branch also misled workers about the availability of same-day access to their earnings.\n\nDrivers had to follow a complex process to access their funds, and when they finally did, they faced further delays or fees if they needed to transfer the money they earned into an account of their choice. This resulted in workers paying more than $10 million in fees to transfer their earnings to an account of their choice.\n\n\u201cWalmart made false promises, illegally opened accounts, and took advantage of more than a million delivery drivers,\u201d said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. \u201cCompanies cannot force workers into getting paid through accounts that drain their earnings with junk fees.\u201d\n\nWalmart (NYSE: WMT), the multinational retail corporation headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, operates the Spark Driver Program, through which gig economy drivers make \u201clast-mile\u201d deliveries from Walmart stores nationwide. Branch is a financial technology company that offers a deposit account at Evolve Bank & Trust that consumers access through a digital app and debit card.\n\nThe CFPB also alleges that Branch engaged in a host of illegal activities related to consumer accounts, including failing to investigate alleged errors, failing to honor stop payment requests, failing to maintain necessary records, failing to provide certain disclosures, and illegally requiring consumers to waive their rights under the law.\n\nThe CFPB alleges that, for approximately two years starting in 2021, Walmart and Branch violated federal law by:\n\nIllegally opening accounts in order for drivers to receive pay and removing driver choice in how to receive pay: Walmart and Branch opened accounts for new drivers by using drivers\u2019 information, including their Social Security numbers, without obtaining the drivers\u2019 consent. Drivers\u2019 pay was then deposited into these accounts without authorization from the drivers. Drivers could not access their earnings without agreeing to Branch\u2019s terms and conditions.

Walmart required Spark Drivers to use Branch accounts or face termination. Harvesting more than ten million in junk fees from drivers: Spark Drivers paid more than ten million dollars in junk fees to Branch to instantly transfer their earnings to an account of their choice.\n\nSpark Drivers paid more than ten million dollars in junk fees to Branch to instantly transfer their earnings to an account of their choice. Deceiving drivers about their access to their earnings: Walmart and Branch misrepresented to drivers that Branch Accounts would give them \u201cinstant access\u201d to pay. In actuality, many drivers experienced delays when accessing their wages or paid fees to transfer their money elsewhere. Branch also deceived the drivers about their ability to stop payments or make certain transfers using the accounts.\n\nEnforcement Action\n\nUnder the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws, including the Truth in Savings Act (TISA), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and the prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). The CFPB\u2019s lawsuit seeks to stop the companies\u2019 unlawful conduct, to provide redress for harmed consumers, and the imposition of a civil money penalty, which would be paid into the CFPB\u2019s victims relief fund.\n\nRead today\u2019s complaint.\n\nToday\u2019s enforcement action follows several actions taken by the CFPB to address consumer protections in the workplace. In October, the CFPB issued guidance that emphasizes how companies using third-party consumer reports, including background dossiers and surveillance-based algorithmic scores, must follow Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) rules. The CFPB has highlighted the growing prevalence of employer-driven debt and the challenges faced by consumers when they become indebted to an employer as a condition of employment.\n\nThis is the CFPB\u2019s first action against a fintech partner of Evolve Bank & Trust related to a deposit product. The CFPB previously filed a lawsuit against SoLo Funds, another Evolve Bank & Trust fintech partner, in the short-term, small-dollar loan space. The Federal Reserve Board issued an enforcement action against Evolve in June, finding the bank failed to properly police its fintech partners.\n\nConsumers can submit complaints about financial products and services by visiting the CFPB\u2019s website or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372).\n\nEmployees who believe their company has violated federal consumer financial protection laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov.
