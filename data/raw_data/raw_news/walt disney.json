            "content": "This past January, I accomplished something I had never done before. I conquered a coast-to-coast, \u201csix Disney parks in 16 days\u201d adventure. Talk about an E-ticket ride!\n\nThe mid-winter whirlwind began with a visit to Walt Disney World from Jan. 7-13. I joined our daughter Tracy\u2019s family in watching her take part in the four-day, four-race Dopey Challenge.\n\nFour days after returning home from Florida, my wife Janet and I flew to Anaheim, California, where we spent three days exploring the Disneyland Resort with our friends Cathy and Rich Reynolds, and Mike and Dorene Splitstone. That visit was topped off with a trip to the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco.\n\nIf nothing else, visiting Disney\u2019s two American resorts in such a close time frame allowed me to compare them, sort of side-by-side. What\u2019s different? What\u2019s the same?\n\nHere are some of my observations after trips to Walt Disney World and Disneyland just a few days apart in January:\n\n\u2018SMALL WORLD\u2019 HOLIDAY SHOW IS SPECTACULAR\n\nEvery year, as part of its holiday celebration, Disneyland overhauls the \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d attraction and turns it into a breathtaking winter wonderland.\n\nIt starts with the exterior of the building, which is decked out in thousands of shimmering lights. There are so many bright, colorful lights, that the attraction can be seen from far-off lands \u2026 like Tomorrowland and Fantasyland.\n\nEven the shrubbery outside \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d is aglow with sparkling lights. If for some reason you don\u2019t go on the ride \u2013 which would be a big mistake \u2013 the exterior lighting is a sight to behold in and of itself.\n\nOnce you climb aboard your boat and glide into the classic attraction, you enter a magical world filled with true holiday wonder.\n\nDuring several sections of the ride, beloved holiday music replaces the equally beloved (?) \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d theme song.\n\nThere are several Christmas trees placed throughout the attraction, as well as holiday lighting, wreaths, faux candles and Season\u2019s Greetings signs. Many of the \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d dolls are decked out in their country\u2019s traditional festive finery.\n\nIt was such an enjoyable trip that we opted to ride again \u2026 and then again. It is an experience that will leave many guests with the time-honored eyes up, jaws down look on their faces.\n\nScore one for Disneyland. The only question I have is: Why don\u2019t they do a holiday makeover on \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d in Walt Disney World?\n\nDISNEYLAND\u2019S UNDERWATER ADVENTURE\n\nDisneyland is home to many unique attractions, some of which are exclusive to the California resort.\n\nOne such experience is the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, located in Tomorrowland.\n\nYes, when Walt Disney World opened in 1971, there was a submarine ride \u2013 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea \u2013 in Fantasyland. But after a 23-year run, the WDW subs closed in 1994, eventually making way for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and the Under the Sea: Journey of the Little Mermaid attractions in an expanded Fantasyland.\n\nDisneyland\u2019s original version of the submarine ride, modeled after the nuclear submarine the USS Nautilus to celebrate its trip under the Arctic Circle, opened in 1959 and ran through 1998. The subs sat dormant until 2007, when they resurfaced with a theme centered around the popular Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo.\n\nThe revamped Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage is a delight, so different from just about any other theme park attraction, past or present. To heck with linear-induction roller coasters and trackless ride systems. The Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage is a truly unique experience.\n\nThe subs accommodate 40 guests, who each peer out a porthole while they\u2019re seated. What they see is a colorful, Nemo-themed undersea world that is truly awash in originality.\n\nScore another one for Disneyland.\n\nA PLETHORA OF MAILBOXES\n\nA few months ago, we wrote about how there were just a few mailboxes located in the four parks at Walt Disney World.\n\nDuring our visit to Disneyland Park, it seemed as if there was a mailbox everywhere I turned. On Main Street USA \u2026 near The Hub \u2026 in Frontierland and scattered elsewhere.\n\nIn fact, there are more than a dozen mailboxes sprinkled throughout Disneyland.\n\nBeing that 2025 is Disneyland\u2019s 70th anniversary, maybe the powers that be are expecting an uptick in letters and postcards sent from The Happiest Place on Earth, which will feature a 2025 Disneyland postmark on them.\n\nSAME ATTRACTIONS \u2026 BUT WITH DIFFERENCES\n\nThere are several attractions that appear in both Disneyland and Walt Disney World. They are basically the same \u2026 but with some very distinct differences.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Big Thunder Mountain, the popular runaway train/roller coaster attraction in Frontierland in both East and West coast Magic Kingdoms. We rode the WDW version prior to its closure for an extensive refurbishment, and then on Jan. 19, we got on the Big Thunder queue in Disneyland.\n\nTo me, the big difference between the two is the level of detail displayed in the queue areas.\n\nIn Florida, most of your wait time is spent in a building that doubles as a fictitious mining company office. There\u2019s shade, water fountains and an occasional fan to ward off the heat. And there\u2019s some clever signage along the queue.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of American Southwest-themed detail located along the track route, but you\u2019re usually going so fast, you tend to miss most of it.\n\nDisneyland\u2019s Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was built on the site where the Rainbow Caverns Mine Train once entertained guests (that attraction opened in 1956).\n\nThe queue for Disneyland\u2019s Thunder Mountain is outdoors, so while you slowly make your way to the loading area around craggily rocks, you get to drink in all of the nuggets placed there by Disney\u2019s Imagineers \u2026 such as the elaborate mining town, flora and fauna native to the Southwest and a collection of menacing-looking coyotes, skunks and rattlesnakes (all Audio-Animatronics, of course). There\u2019s even a goat laden with dynamite.\n\nI found Disneyland\u2019s version \u2013 particularly the queue \u2013 to be much more detailed and interesting.\n\nSpeaking of detail, the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction in Disneyland is a delight, particularly the elaborate opening sequence though the Louisiana bayou.\n\nOnce you board your boat in an area known as Laffite\u2019s Landing, the journey begins through a darkened bayou, with views of guests enjoying the Blue Bayou Restaurant to the right and banjo music playing. To your left, there are a few houseboats bobbing on the water and several fireflies lighting the night.\n\nAfter your boat plunges down two waterfalls, you enter an extended underground grotto, where you\u2019re greeted by pirate-themed debauchery, gold doubloons, shiny chalices and party-hardy skeletons. As you glide by, a menacing voice tells us that \u201cdead men tell no tales\u201d \u2026 over and over.\n\nYour boat glides gently past an old pirate shipwreck, where a skeletal helmsman pilot guides the ship through a thunderstorm. There\u2019s also a boney pirate \u201cdrinking\u201d rum and another one examining a treasure map.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve sailed past all the pirate booty, the \u201clively\u201d skeletons and the glittering treasure trove, it\u2019s on to a full-on naval battle \u2026 which is pretty much where Walt Disney World\u2019s version of Pirates of the Caribbean begins.\n\nIn both attractions, there\u2019s a pirate galleon (The Wicked Wench) to the left and a Spanish fortress to the right; both lob cannon balls at one another during the skirmish, with some of the ordnance splash-landing close to your boat.\n\nThen it\u2019s on to the village of Puerto Dorado on Isla Tesoro, which is overrun with pirates in search of treasure. The buccaneers have captured Carlos, the town\u2019s mayor, as they try to pry the loot\u2019s whereabouts from him by repeatedly dunking him in a well.\n\nFrom a window above, Carlos\u2019 wife tells her water-logged husband \u201cDon\u2019t be \u2018cheecken\u2019.\u201d Nearby, Captain Jack Sparrow makes the first of his three appearances.\n\nAfter the revamped Auction scene, you glide into a town that\u2019s been set ablaze. The final scene, in full view of a relaxed Capt. Jack, sees several pirates \u2013 with numerous barrels of explosives nearby \u2013 engage in a ferocious gun battle.\n\nWalt Disney World\u2019s version of the Pirates attraction was not part of the park\u2019s opening day lineup and was only added after guest complaints. Florida\u2019s low water table added to the \u201cdumbing down\u201d of the attraction.\n\nTo me, Disneyland\u2019s Pirates ride is far superior, offering a more elaborate, more detailed experience.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of Dark Rides. To be blunt, Disneyland\u2019s dark rides are FAR BETTER \u2026 and far more numerous, than Walt Disney World\u2019s two dark rides (Peter Pan and Winnie the Pooh).\n\nWhen Disneyland opened in 1955, the inner workings of their dark rides (attractions where guests ride in vehicles through a darkened, Disney story-themed show) were pretty simple. Most of the figures were plywood cutouts, covered in colorful paint with primitive lighting effects. You rode your themed vehicle in and out of sectioned off \u201crooms\u201d as the story of a specific Disney classic animated film unfolded.\n\nToday, Disneyland\u2019s lineup of dark rides in Fantasyland includes Pinocchio\u2019s Daring Journey, Snow White\u2019s Enchanted Wish, Mr. Toad\u2019s Wild Ride and Peter Pan\u2019s Flight. Each has been upgraded over the years to include enhanced fluorescent lighting and special black light effects. In many cases, the simple plywood cutouts have been replaced by sophisticated Audio-Animatronics figures.\n\nBy far my favorite Disneyland dark ride is Alice in Wonderland. Guests are seated in ride vehicles made to look like the caterpillar from the original 1951 film. Alice\u2019s curious adventure unfolds as you enter the first floor of the darkened show building and then down \u2013 you guessed it! \u2013 the rabbit hole as pieces of furniture, artwork and vases swirl around.\n\nRiders glide past several classic scenes from the movie, including Alice in pursuit of the White Rabbit, who frets about being late for a very important date.\n\nThere are appearances by Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, a garden of flowers singing \u201cAll in the Golden Afternoon,\u201d the Caterpillar asking riders \u201cWho are you?\u201d through smoky letters, Tiger Lily, the Dandelion and the Cheshire Cat.\n\nFrom here, riders encounter a group of singing playing cards, who are \u201cpainting the roses red\u201d for the Queen of Hearts, who is seen playing croquet using a flamingo for a mallet and a hedgehog for a ball.\n\nWhile all this is going on, riders are gradually making their way up to a second floor. While there, guests pass through the queen\u2019s courtroom, then past a brigade of playing cards and two menacing guards before traveling outside.\n\nFrom this rooftop perch, Matterhorn Mountain and the monorail are visible before riders glide down a winding path into the attraction\u2019s final scene, the Mad Tea Party. After the Mad Hatter and March Hare sing \u201cA Very Merry UnBirthday.\u201d Alice proclaims that it is her unbirthday, as well. The White Rabbit then ducks as the candles of a giant unbirthday cake explode.\n\nIn all, Alice in Wonderland is a fun, clever homage to the Disney animated classic. And if you want to experience more Alice, the Mad Tea Party attraction is just steps away.\n\nLastly, there are the two railroads that circumnavigate Disneyland and Walt Disney World.\n\nThe Walt Disney World Railroad has some interesting areas, all of which take place at or near its three stops \u2013 Main Street USA, Frontierland and Fantasyland. For the most part, though, the train ride takes place along some pretty desolate and swampy backwoods sections of the Magic Kingdom.\n\nAt Disneyland, the railroad has several unique highlights. For one, the special Lilly Belle caboose (named in honor of Walt Disney\u2019s wife Lillian) brings up the rear of the train.\n\nAfter leaving the New Orleans Square station, the train crosses over a trestle bridge, with Frontierland and the aforementioned Big Thunder Mountain in view.\n\nAfter exiting the Fantasyland station, the train travels behind the front fa\u00e7ade of the \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d attraction.\n\nFinally, between the Tomorrowland station and Main Street, the train travels through an elaborate diorama featuring beautiful scenes from the Grand Canyon and an area known as Primeval World.\n\nMany of the dinosaurs seen during this segment were used in the Ford\u2019s Magic Skyway attraction at the 1964-1965 New York World\u2019s Fair.\n\nChuck Schmidt is an award-winning journalist and retired Disney cast member who has covered all things Disney since 1984 in both print and on-line.

From hand-painted animation cels to vintage toys and theme park memorabilia, these treasures offer a glimpse into Disney\u2019s rich history while capturing the hearts \u2014 and wallets \u2014 of fans and collectors alike. Some items, like the original map of Disneyland or Mickey Mouse\u2019s first color cartoon celluloid, have fetched hundreds of thousands of dollars at auctions, proving that Disney magic extends far beyond the screen.\n\nHere are the most valuable vintage Disney collectibles we could find.\n\n1935 \u2018The Band Concert\u2019 Celluloid\n\nWEBCOT/ebay\n\nPrice: Sold in 1999 for $420,000 in a private sale\n\nThe hand-painted celluloids from Mickey Mouse\u2019s first color adventure, \u201cThe Band Concert,\u201d are worth bookoo bucks. Dating back to 1935, the celluloids are vintage relics that hone in on Disney\u2019s deep roots. One reportedly sold for a whopping $420,000 back in 1999, and these cels are still circulating the auction block with one of them recently going for $36,000 in August of 2024.\n\n1941 \u2018Mickey Mouse Outwits the Phantom Blot\u2019 Comic Book\n\nJONATHAN|COMICS / ebay\n\nPrice: Sold in 2020 by Heritage Auctions for $78,000\n\nSince their first encounter in 1941, Mickey Mouse and the Phantom Blot have had several other rendezvous. Still, the most value lies within their original adventure in the early Walt Disney comics. This particular comic was the 16th edition of the first series and while it only cost a dime in the 40s, these days it can sell for tens of thousands at the right auction to the right buyer.\n\nOriginal Map of Disneyland\n\nTibrina Hobson/WireImage / Getty\n\nPrice: Sold in 2017 by Van Eaton Galleries for $708,000\n\nWhat better way to see how far Disneyland has come over the years than to spend six figures on an original map of the place? Seems like a modest and reasonable investment, no? The O.G. map of the theme park reached beyond $700,000 at a 2017 auction and despite its massive selling price, it actually fell short of its $900,000 expected selling price.\n\n1935 Mickey\u2019s Service Station Mickey and Goofy Production Celluloid\n\nWalt Disney \u2013 Screenshot from the DVD, Walt Disney Treasures, Mickey Mouse in Black and White / Wikipedia\n\nPrice: Sold in 2014 by Heritage Auctions for $98,588\n\nThis 1935 celluloid comes from one of Mickey\u2019s last black-and-white cartoons, adding to its value, and proving that the right buyer doesn\u2019t mind dropping obscene amounts of money on special cels.\n\nWalt Disney\u2019s Personal \u2018Cinderella\u2019 Script\n\nBettmann / Getty\n\nPrice: Sold in 2017 by Heritage Auctions for $36,000\n\nThis isn\u2019t your average write-up of the plot and character lines in \u201cCinderella.\u201d The actual, authentic book containing Walt Disney\u2019s personal script for the iconic princess flick sold for almost $40,000 in 2017. Not only is the script an encapsulation of Disney\u2019s genius, but it also contains his scribblings and annotations within, making it all the more special for Disney fanatics.\n\n1930 Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse Hurdy Gurdy Wind-Up Tin Toy\n\nScott\u2019s Shut-in Flea Market / ebay\n\nPrice: Sold in 2022 by Heritage Auctions for $13,200\n\nCan someone explain why toys in the 1930s were even better and cooler than those made almost 100 years later? Please make that make sense. This wind-up tin Mickey Mouse toy is adorable, especially with the tiny Minnie Mouse atop Mickey\u2019s organ. Many of the early, most collectible Mickey toys were made in Germany, and this wind-up is a prime example of the German-crafted toys featuring the mouse.\n\n1930 Mickey Mouse Book: First Edition\n\nLCG Signatures / ebay\n\nPrice: Sold in 2024 by RR Auction for $7,155\n\nBefore there were Disney comics, the brand forayed into publishing with the \u201cMickey Mouse Book\u201d publications. The first edition, which came out in 1930, had 16 pages inside and included two short stories, a board game, and a song. It\u2019s no wonder a vintage, all-purpose book like that would sell for thousands these days.\n\n1928 Mickey Mouse Poster\n\nAmazon\n\nPrice: Sold in 2012 by Heritage Auctions for $101,575\n\nThis Mickey Mouse poster is as vintage as humanly possible since it came out the same year the Mouse was born, in 1928. Originally unveiled as an advertisement, this vintage Disney collectible is now considered a relic worthy of a price tag stretching beyond $100,000.\n\n1930s Charlotte Clark Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Dolls\n\ncalifornia.trading.post / ebay\n\nPrice: Sold in 2024 by Heritage Auctions for $7,800\n\nCharlotte Clark\u2019s first Mickey Mouse dolls were made exclusively for her Disney fan nephew, until she took them to Walt and Roy Disney who loved them so much that they assembled a team to help her create more. These days, they are seen as beloved collectibles and people will pay thousands for the dolls.\n\nLife-Size Jessica Rabbit Figure\n\ndisneychef2008 / ebay\n\nPrice: Sold in 2024 by Heritage Auctions for $15,600\n\nJessica Rabbit might be the most crush-worthy cartoon character of all time, so we\u2019re not surprised that someone paid upwards of $15,000 to have a six-foot Jess all to themselves. Imagine those Christmas cards.\n\nDisneyland Original Club 33 Sign\n\nKen Lund / Wikipedia\n\nPrice: Sold in 2022 by Heritage Auctions for $108,000\n\nOriginally a members-only club inside Disneyland, Club 33 is an executive lounge envisioned by Walt Disney himself. Over the years, the sign in front has been replaced a few times, but the O.G. version is by far the most valuable, marked by its colossal $108,000 price tag at a 2022 auction.\n\nCoonskin Hat from \u2018Davy Crockett Stories\u2019\n\nSilver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\nPrice: Sold in 2018 by Heritage Auctions for $12,400\n\nDavyyyyy, Davy Crockett! Crockett\u2019s coon cap is one of the most iconic costume props and while you can find knock-off versions on Amazon for about $20, the real vintage Disney collectible realized a much higher $12,400 at auction.\n\nThe post 12 of the Most Valuable Vintage Disney Items appeared first on Wealth Gang.",

The plaintiff claims the man, who was employed at Hollywood Studios at the time, took a photo or video up her 14-year-old granddaughter's dress while she was in a store. The woman alleges Disney should have known the man was unfit for his job and posed a risk to guests, employees, and minors, referencing a prior incident where he allegedly recorded a female co-worker, which had been reported to a Disney supervisor.\n\n\n\nA lawsuit has been filed against Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S. Inc. in connection with a 2023 investigation into a former Florida employee accused of filming up the skirts of female guests.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nOn March 30, 2023, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Office responded to Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios after a woman alerted Disney security, that a man dressed in a Star Wars uniform had used his cellphone to take a photo up her granddaughter's dress when they stopped to look at toys in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge merchandise store, according to investigative documents.\n\nHer granddaughter was 14 at the time. The man was not immediately identified, according to the report.\n\nThe next day, Orange County deputies responded to the same theme park after an employee reported witnessing a man, later identified as Jorge Diaz Vega, then 26, recording an \"upskirt\" video of a 19-year-old female guest, according to an arrest report.\n\nMORE HEADLINES:\n\nDiaz Vega, employed at the Star Wars retail store at the time, admitted to recording videos of female Disney World guests for approximately six years, authorities said.\n\nHe further told investigators that recording these videos had become a \"guilty pleasure\" for him and estimated that he had 600 such videos saved on his phone, which he showed to investigators, according to officials.\n\nDiaz Vega was arrested for video voyeurism, records show.\n\nLawsuit claims Disney should have done more\n\nLatest developments:\n\nAn 18-page lawsuit was filed last week in the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit against Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S. Inc., by the plaintiff \u2013 the victim's grandparent.\n\nThe suit alleges that prior to the incident with the 14-year-old girl in March 2023, Diaz Vega was allegedly caught recording a female co-worker, which was reported to a Disney supervisor.\n\n\u2018Failed to take appropriate action\u2019\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that Disney knew or should have known that Diaz Vega was unfit for his position and the potential danger he posed to the theme park's guests, employees, and minors.\n\n\"DISNEY, through its employees, agents, servants, and/or apparent agents knew or should have known of JORGE DIAZVEGA's propensity to commit acts of video voyeurism and to otherwise film other employees and guests without their consent and DISNEY ratified the prior misconduct of its employee when it failed to take appropriate action to prevent the incident from occurring.\" \u2014 Excerpt from page 4 of the lawsuit\n\nThe suit also alleges that the theme park failed to investigate Diaz Vega's employment record and did not \"adequately supervise\" him despite a prior report of recording or photographing a co-worker without consent.\n\nTo be clear, Diaz Vega is no longer an employee of Disney.\n\nFOX 35 News has reached out to both Disney and the attorneys who filed the new lawsuit for comment. We're waiting to hear back.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe plaintiff is requesting a judgment of more than $50,000 and is demanding a jury trial.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED WITH FOX 35 ORLANDO:",

Notably, Peter Dinklage criticised Disney\u2019s decision to use CGI instead of actors with dwarfism to play the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Snow White has received 79,000 user ratings following its release and currently has a score of 1.9 out of 10, which places it in joint 13th position with Disaster Movie, From Justin to Kelly and Race 3 in the list of the lowest-rated movies on the platform.\n\nSnow White did top the box office for its opening weekend despite the backlash faced by viewers on IMDB, however, it didn\u2019t quite hit the heights anticipated. In the United States, it secured $44.3 million and overall achieved a total of $87.3 million from its global launch which is below the $100 million expectation.\n\nFor the next two weeks, it\u2019s likely to continue to succeed at the box office as families head to the cinema with a distinct lack of competition until The Minecraft Movie arrives on April 4th.\n\nIt was initially reported that the movie\u2019s production budget was $209 million; however, expensive reshoots later increased this number significantly, and it is believed to have cost between $240 and $270 million in total. Additionally, major costs linked to distribution and marketing can often be equal to the figures related to production, but these are currently unknown for Snow White.\n\nDisney scaled back the promotion for the highly anticipated movie. The film\u2019s European premiere, in Segovia, Spain, was in a castle that inspired the movie, but only around 100 hand-selected people attended. Disney also prevented cast members from giving interviews on the red carpet.\n\nThe differing stance on the Israel-Hamas war by Gadot and Zegler is another reason why the live-action movie has courted controversy for Disney. Zegler\u2019s Latina heritage was also cause for criticism from some quarters upon the announcement of her involvement in the titular role.",

Whether it was director Sean Baker\u2019s sweep or costume designer Paul Tazewell\u2019s notable win, the Academy Awards made history on multiple fronts.\n\nSean Baker becomes 1st director to take home 4 Oscars since Walt Disney\n\nThe Anora director took home four Oscars on Sunday night, a first since Walt Disney did the same in 1954.\n\nBaker won not only Best Director but also Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing, even poking fun at his multiple roles in his acceptance speech for editing.\n\n\u201cGod if you saw that footage \u2014 I saved this film in the edit. Trust me! That director should never work again,\u201d he joked.\n\nDisney pulled off the same feat more than 70 years ago, when the Mickey Mouse creator won for Best Documentary Feature, Best Documentary (Short Subject), Best Short Subject (Cartoon) and Best Short Subject (Two Reel).\n\nBaker is also the first director to take home the Film Editing award as a solo editor.\n\nPaul Tazewell is the 1st Black man to receive Costume Design Oscar\n\nPaul Tazewell, who created the costumes for Wicked, became the first Black man to win the award for Best Costume Design at the Oscars, a moment he called \u201castounding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Academy, for this very significant honor,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech. \u201cI'm so proud of this.\"\n\nTazewell elaborated on the honor when he went back to the Oscars press room.\n\n\u201cI've been designing costumes for over 35 years. Much has been on Broadway, and now into film,\" he said. \"The whole way through, there was never a Black male designer that I saw that I could follow that I could see as an inspiration.

And to resist. So, this prize goes to her. And it goes to the two extraordinary women who gave life to her, Fernanda Torres, and Fernanda Montenegro,\u201d he said.\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a is the 1st American of Dominican origin to win an Oscar\n\nThe Emilia P\u00e9rez actress earned her first Oscar nomination and win for Best Supporting Actress, making her the first American of Dominican origin to win an Academy Award.

            "content": "The earliest memory I have of Snow White\u2019s Scary Adventures at Disneyland is being in the shadowy, utterly terrifying woods with monster trees crunching all around the ride vehicle as the old witch jump-scares you for what felt like the hundredth time. I can\u2019t tell you how old I was when I first rode the ride, but my first introduction to the hag form of the Evil Queen, even before I watched Walt Disney Animation\u2019s Snow White in its entirety, was specifically the Disney Sing-Along Songs: Disneyland Fun! VHS tape my parents got me. It\u2019s one of my biggest kid core memories, which probably explains my career.\n\nIn it the Disney Villains dance along to \u201cGrim Grinning Ghosts\u201d and it is childhood nightmare fuel in the best way. The costuming on the hag, with its face mask contorted to one expression based on the look post-transformation in Snow White, will haunt you. I wore that tape out as I eagerly anticipated annual birthday or Christmas trips to Disneyland as a Southern California native.\n\nSnow White\u2019s Scary Adventures is the version of the ride that existed between 1983 and 2020 at Disneyland; it was the second version of a ride that opened along with Disneyland itself in 1955. Scary Adventures is locked into my childhood memories; it was legit harrowing, because the original perspective of the ride was that \u201cyou\u201d were dropped in as Snow White is leaving the kingdom and encountering the scary woods and the rest of the story she wasn\u2019t privy too\u2026 but hey, theme park universes do their own thing. I never got to ride the Walt Disney World version, but it\u2019s known to also have been horrifying, before being replaced by a Princess meet-and-greet area and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train family coaster at the Magic Kingdom. But yes, there were once two Snow White attractions with no Snow White, involving a ride into some very Evil Dead-tinged woods with a wicked old witch trying to kill you at every turn. Truly, it was the best.\n\nThe Imagineers didn\u2019t hold back; the design of the dark woods with those monster tree faces was disturbingly disorienting, especially in contrast to the very cheery and bright fairytale fare outside. It was so metal: the beautiful Evil Queen animatronic did a transformation where, right before your eyes, she would cast the spell on herself then twist toward riders as the old hag with screeching cackles that are seared into my memory. Then for the rest of the ride she would pop out at you like the Babadook, taking you by surprise no matter how familiar you were with its storybook twists and turns.\n\nMuch like the VHS version of the old hag, her figures\u2019 faces stuck creepily in those haunting expressions. It was most excellent and sorely missed because it made the Fantasyland mainstay just as scary as the Haunted Mansion. It was such a memorable thrill ride, with the iconic and truly scary version of the queen\u2019s disguise, which with her first appearance in my consciousness on that tape made me terrified of her. It really toed that line of scary and fun as a gateway ride for little horror fans in the making.\n\nDisneyland celebrates its 70th this year with the third incarnation of its Snow White attraction, Snow White\u2019s Enchanted Wish, which opened in 2021. While the fun spooky elements have been ripped out in favor for more scenes with Snow White, a few major elements from the ride remain. Thankfully the Evil Queen\u2019s epic transformation is still the showstopper effect, and we love the poison apple sequence that works along with the polished look to the incredible original set designs. And there\u2019s a couple of her peek-a-boo moments still featured as part of its new, more cutesy storyline that tamed the horror show it once was into a more digestible Disney family ride.\n\nStill, it is a little saddening that it\u2019s hard to find official images of the older ride that many people today still remember; a lot of its past as Snow White\u2019s Scary Adventures has seemingly been scrubbed from the official Disney Experiences channels. We\u2019d much rather see Disney embrace its own weird history and acknowledge why certain rides are given thematic changes. Taking away the work Imagineers put in that version is silly when they should be proud of scarring kids for life\u2014because those kids learned you can overcome fears and leveled up to the next thrill ride like the Haunted Mansion, the former Tower of Terror, and the seasonal Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy.\n\nI believe that in theme parks, you should build up to those more intense rides, because you can\u2019t just go from pixie dust and singing animals to ghosts and drops on coasters. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m glad this current version was my daughter\u2019s first ride. (You can see how it went in my social media post above.) I love how Snow White\u2019s Enchanted Wish now combines scenes from the animated film into the environment and has a dazzling mine sequence and more fairytale romance as the through-line. Would it have been my daughter\u2019s first ride if it were still Snow White\u2019s Scary Adventures? Not a chance.",

I know a thing or two about the parks but even I was surprised by the newest Disney announcement!\n\nIn case you missed it, there\u2019s going to be a brand-new lounge in EPCOT! The new lounge, called GEO-82, is a Spaceship Earth-themed lounge that will surround you with iconic shapes and intricate structures inspired by the park\u2019s instantly recognizable icon.\n\nDisney recently announced the name of the new lounge after initially announcing it at D23 in August 2024! We\u2019ve been eagerly awaiting the new details and thankfully, Disney provided. There was one detail though that caught me off guard! The new lounge will be for adults only!\n\nThe lounge will only be available for guests 21+ and thanks to chatter online, we know fans are torn! Many fans are excited about the adult-only space because there are very few in Disney World, but there are also fans who are pretty upset.\n\nFor me personally, I don\u2019t have the strongest opinion when it comes to whether the lounge allows kids or not but I was surprised. At the time of writing, only Jellyrolls, Atlantic Dance, and Trader Sam\u2019s after 8 PM are adult-only locations. Jellyrolls is permanently closing in April before it moves to another location, although we don\u2019t know where yet.\n\nThere are a few spots that require children to be specific ages, for example, you must be 10 to dine at Victoria and Albert\u2019s or 16 to go on the Keys to the Kingdom Tour, but there are very limited options for true adult-only spaces in Disney. That\u2019s why this latest announcement was so surprising!\n\nWhile it might not be a welcome surprise to everyone, I think it is pretty exciting! The term \u201cDisney Adult\u201d exists for a reason and I see no reason why adults shouldn\u2019t have their own spaces within the parks. If I can\u2019t get a makeover at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, then I should be allowed one lounge without kids to make up for it. Seems more than fair to me!\n\nI will say though, I do understand why some adults might be upset that they can\u2019t bring their kids with them into the lounge. If you only travel to the parks with your kids, it might be frustrating to miss out on this spot, but you can also look at this as an opportunity to finally take that adult-only trip you\u2019ve been dreaming about.\n\nThe lounge will also require advance dining reservations once it opens in late Spring 2025. The spot will serve up innovative cocktails and \u201cglobally influenced\u201d small plates as well. I can\u2019t wait to see how this spot evolves once it opens. As always, be sure to keep following AllEars for more Disney news and updates.\n\nTell me in the comments how you feel about this adult-exclusive spot!\n\nPost a Comment",

The fire left visitors with an unforgettable, albeit alarming, spring break memory. On Saturday, March 22, 2025, plumes of dark smoke billowed over the park\u2019s iconic World Showcase.\n\nThe fire originated from a walk-in cooler in the backstage area near the France Pavilion, a popular section of EPCOT\u2019s World Showcase. While the exact cause of the fire remains undisclosed, the incident quickly caught the attention of parkgoers and staff. Eyewitnesses reported seeing thick, black smoke rising high above the France Pavilion. The smoke created a stark contrast against the typically picturesque skyline of the theme park.\n\nThe Fire\u2019s Impact On EPCOT Operations\n\nDisney World officials and the Reedy Creek Fire Services, a department specifically assigned to assist the resort, sprang into action immediately after the fire was detected. In a precautionary measure, guests aboard the popular Remy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure ride were swiftly evacuated.\n\nOne witness, posting in the Walt Disney World Tips and Tricks Facebook group, recounted the experience: \u201cEveryone is physically OK, I believe.

The France Pavilion was temporarily closed but reopened to guests at 8:20 p.m., allowing the park to maintain its usual closing time of 9 p.m.\n\nRemarkably, the fire was extinguished within approximately 20 minutes. By Sunday morning, the Remy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure ride had resumed normal operations, minimizing the long-term impact on visitors\u2019 experiences.\n\nTraveler Concerns And Park Reassurances\n\nThe incident naturally raised concerns among travelers, especially those planning visits during the busy spring break season.

            "content": "A large fire broke out Saturday evening at Disney World's Epcot theme park in Orlando with a walk-in cooler igniting inside a backstage area, Entertainment Weekly has learned.\n\nThe cooler was located in Epcot's France area, specifically in an employees-only section not accessible to guests, a source familiar with the situation tells EW shortly after the flames were spotted by visitors. The device caught on fire at around 7:20 p.m. local time, and was quickly extinguished before the blaze spread further. No one was injured in the fire.\n\nFootage from the incident (below), captured by a park guest riding the Skyliner attraction, shows large black smoke billowing up from an area between the Remy's Ratatouille Adventure ride within the park's France pavilion and walkways deeper into the park's Morocco pavilion. The video shows guests huddled in backstage areas.\n\n\"Oh my God, it's right there!\" says a shocked onlooker in the footage, which shows a large cloud of billowing black smoke and a line of orange flames.\n\nAfter EW's initial report on Saturday, local news additionally reported that riders were evacuated from Remy's Ratatouille Adventure during the blaze.\n\nEW has reached out to representatives for the Walt Disney World Resort as well as the Orlando Fire Department for more information.\n\nMore footage circulating online shows clouds of smoke rising into the sky, visible from the nearby Boardwalk area just outside Epcot's gates.\n\nAnother video recorded Saturday and shared to TikTok shows English performer Peter Noone singing on stage at the park's America pavilion while smoke fills the area. The 77-year-old turns toward the blaze and exclaims, \"France is on fire!\" while the crowd chuckles at the observation, which came amid the park's Flower & Garden festival, an annual highly attended springtime event that draws major crowds to Epcot.\n\nWant more entertainment news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more.\n\nThe Epcot fire isn't the first major blaze at a Disney parks property. In recent years, the Maleficent dragon figure at California's Disneyland park also caught fire during a Fantasmic! show performance in early 2023, leading to the removal of the pyrotechnic effect later that year.\n\nEpcot is one of four major theme parks currently operating at Walt Disney World. It opened as the second of the Florida resort's lineup of parks, with the first being Magic Kingdom, which opened in 1971. It was followed by Disney's Hollywood Studios (which opened as the Disney-MGM Studios in 1989) and Animal Kingdom in 1998.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks widely held by individuals in 2025.\n\nIndividual investors, often called retail investors, typically invest their personal capital directly into the stock market, driven primarily by personal research, news sentiment, social media trends, or recommendations from peers. They often favor stocks of recognizable brands or companies whose products and services they use regularly, as well as growth stocks perceived to offer high return potential. While their success varies widely (often marked by emotional decision-making and mixed results) monitoring retail investor trends can be valuable, as these investors collectively have the power to significantly influence stock prices and market volatility. Understanding where retail attention is focused can provide early signals of market shifts, speculative bubbles, or emerging investment opportunities. Just to recall two recent instances when retail investors successfully short-squeezed and caused billions of losses to the smartest hedge funds in the world \u2013 as they say, even the less informed parties may occasionally win big, and it is, therefore, important to be aware of their tendencies and trends.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Stocks That Members of Congress Own\n\nThe type of stocks most widely held by individuals has been changing over time, from consumer-centered brands that were popular in the \u201980s and \u201990s to popular dot-com names in the 2000s, and finally to technology stocks in the 2010s, as retail investors had firsthand experience with their products and platforms. One thing is certain \u2013 retail investors are often the last to jump on the ship, and periods of active inflow of retail money into stocks coincide with market peaks. A similar situation happened in the last two years, as the majority of the returns of the US stock market have been driven by a handful of 7\u20138 stocks with primary exposure to the AI megatrend \u2013 as you will see below, many of these stocks are now among the most widely held by individuals. It is no surprise that at this exact moment, the Magnificent 8 category, which confidently outperformed the whole market in the last two years, is finally lagging behind.\n\nIt should be noted that retail investors are not always wrong; in fact, you can frequently find quite promising high-growth names among those preferred by individuals. This category of investors often flocks together on social media platforms and actively shares knowledge with each other, meaning that the latest technological breakthroughs and inventions are already in their sights. In the current market, with uncertainties and fear looming from all directions (recall the tariff wars expected in April, large public spending cuts, layoffs, and Medicare/Medicaid threats), the \u201csmart money\u201d has been very cautious with US stocks. In fact, there has been a noticeable rotation of money from US stocks to the less overvalued foreign markets, like Germany and China, which have been using stimulus to fuel growth. With the US market becoming less favored by institutional investors, retail investors could enter the spotlight again and decide who the major winners will be.\n\nThis is particularly relevant as the modern investing philosophy has slowly drifted away from the rigid value-investing approach, which favors cheap, undervalued stocks, toward a preference for higher-growth stocks, which depend on momentum and often trade at high valuations for prolonged periods. The key takeaway for readers is that market winners are often not the cheap and undervalued stocks, but the stocks that gain the spotlight and become a magnet for money.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Robinhood Investor Index (which shows the most popular stocks on the investing platform Robinhood) and the Yahoo Finance Most Active Stocks screener to find a list of stocks most widely held by individual investors. We then compare the list with our proprietary database of hedge funds\u2019 ownership, as of Q4 2024 and include in the article the top 12 stocks with the largest number of hedge funds that own the stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a global entertainment conglomerate operating across media networks, theme parks, film studios, and streaming services. Its segments include Disney Entertainment, which oversees film and television production through brands like Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Studios; ESPN, which focuses on sports broadcasting; and Disney Experiences, which operates theme parks, resorts, and cruise lines worldwide. DIS also owns and operates the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ streaming platforms.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has achieved significant progress in streaming, transitioning from losses exceeding $1 billion per quarter to profitability with visibility toward double-digit margins. The company maintains a strong content portfolio, with their film studios achieving #1 position at the box office generating $5.5 billion and owning 50% of the top most streamed shows of the year. The integration of Hulu on Disney+ for bundled subscribers has driven engagement and improved churn dynamics. DIS\u2019 content excellence is evident through its 60 Emmy Awards wins, surpassing all competitors.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has made strategic technology investments, including key hires from YouTube and Meta, focusing on algorithmic programming and personalization. In terms of advertising, DIS leverages its position as the #1 entertainment company in living rooms according to Nielsen\u2019s Gauge report, with Hulu\u2019s experience providing advanced ad solutions. The company maintains a strong focus on kids and family programming, with Bluey being the most streamed show in the United States last year. DIS\u2019 technology initiatives include addressing password sharing and developing features specifically targeting how kids interact with content. Besides 108 hedge funds owning the stock, DIS is also one of the most widely held stocks by individuals.\n\nOverall DIS ranks 7th on our list of the 12 most widely held stocks by individuals in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DIS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks To Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Once upon a time \u2014 December 21, 1937, to be precise \u2014 Walt Disney Productions released the classic film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, enchanting audiences around the world and effectively establishing the nascent studio as a preeminent animation powerhouse. Now, the timeless tale has been reimagined as a live-action musical adventure, with Disney\u2019s Snow White set to open in theaters worldwide on Friday, March 21.\n\nDirected by Marc Webb, with a screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson, Snow White stars Golden Globe\u00ae winner Rachel Zegler as Snow White, the courageous, kind, and spirited princess; Gal Gadot as Snow White\u2019s icy and unyielding stepmother, the Evil Queen; and Tony\u00ae Award winner Andrew Burnap as Jonathan, a young man eager to defy the monarchy.\n\n\u201cSnow White is iconic, obviously, and the opportunity to look at that character and her story through a slightly new lens was thrilling,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI kept thinking about my daughter and what messages I want to send her way; I want her to be proud of what her dad is working on, and this was a great way to do that. There\u2019s something elemental about Snow White\u2019s kindness, but she\u2019s also quite brave. She finds the best in people, and so I think Snow White is a reminder that there\u2019s real value in being kind and having good faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of motifs and themes that are really important, but something that\u2019s stayed with me is Snow White\u2019s optimism, her kindness, and her ability to inspire the people around her,\u201d Webb said of the beloved character\u2019s timeless qualities. \u201cWhat cuts through everything else in the film is her gentle, thoughtful, quite powerful worldview of kindness.\u201d\n\nIn Snow White, the vain Evil Queen rules the kingdom with an iron fist. When her magic mirror reveals her stepdaughter is the fairest in all the land, she devises a devious plan to get rid of the princess. After fleeing the castle to escape her stepmother\u2019s wrath, Snow White encounters woodland creatures that lead her to a picturesque cottage in the woods. There, she befriends seven dwarfs \u2014 Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy \u2014 who spend their days digging for jewels in the nearby mines. She also meets Jonathan, who is captivated by her beauty and benevolence. Thanks to her new friends, Snow White is inspired to find her voice and summon the strength to face the Evil Queen.\n\nAccording to Webb, Snow White honors the original story while also expanding upon it. In fact, before cameras rolled at London\u2019s Pinewood Studios in 2021, he visited the Walt Disney Archives for creative inspiration. That visit, Webb recalled, proved to be invaluable.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite discoveries was an early sketch of the prince in the dungeon,\u201d Webb said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much of a storyline in the original film about him. It\u2019s all very lovely and graceful and so beautifully rendered. So, we went back and we used what Walt Disney had started to build and expanded on that in our movie. The storyline with Jonathan, who\u2019s the love interest in our movie, really began with that one image of the prince stuck in the dungeon. It felt like we were reaching into the past and connecting with the incredibly talented animators who had come before us.\u201d\n\nThree-time Academy Award\u00ae winner Sandy Powell \u2014 who famously created the costumes for the 2015 live-action adaptation of Disney\u2019s Cinderella \u2014 \u201ctook copious notes\u201d during that visit, Webb said: \u201cShe looked at not just the original renderings of all the costumes in Snow White, but the historical periods from which they came. She fleshed out those ideas. She got a great sense of history, attention, and reverence for these characters to build on.\u201d\n\nAnother highlight during his research trip to the Archives involved Jeff Morrow, who wrote the film\u2019s original score. \u201cThe Archives brought out the old jugs that were used in \u2018Silly Song,\u2019 and Jeff and I actually got to play them on the Disney studio lot,\u201d Webb said. \u201cWe recorded them, and you can hear them in \u2018Silly Song\u2019 \u2014 and in \u2018Whistle While You Work, by the way! You can hear the calliope bit as Sneezy is sneezing his way through the song.\u201d\n\nGetting to record a new version of the yodel song that the seven dwarfs perform to entertain Snow White? In hindsight, Webb said, \u201cThat was a magical, fun day in Burbank.\u201d\n\nThat magic is evident, and the breathtaking live-action adaptation \u2014 featuring original songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul \u2014 demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible.\n\n\u201cYou want to be surrounded by all the emotion; it makes for a thrilling, completely profound, fun time at the movies,\u201d Webb explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a concert or a live show; you get to experience it with a crowd and hear the excitement. I just experienced it at the premiere, and the response was humbling. It was wonderful to hear the laughs, the cheers, the sighs, the applause. That was as good of an experience as I\u2019ve had in my career.\u201d",

            "content": "Once upon a time, Disney made a business decision: if it was going to adapt its library of animated movies into live-action features (with merch and theme park tie-ins galore), it should add Snow White to the pipeline. The 1937 classic \u2013 the company\u2019s first full-length animated feature ever, its first crack at a veritable goldmine of princess IP \u2013 would follow the modernizations (and attendant revisions) of Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast, released in 2015 and 2017, respectively. It was only logical, Snow White being one of its most recognizable and brand-defining characters. The company began developing a live-action feature in 2016, in the heady first wave of its IP era.\n\nNine years later, Snow White has finally made it the big screen, but the journey has been anything but a fairytale. The remake has been a saga of delays, culture war flashpoints and controversies, some earned and much not. The new Snow White has managed the difficult feat of being a children\u2019s movie that irritates both ends of the political spectrum at once, from rightwing nuts crying \u201cwoke\u201d over the casting of Rachel Zegler, an American actor of Colombian descent, to pro-Palestinian advocates upset over the presence of the Israeli actor and IDF supporter Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. And that\u2019s not even getting to the obvious and nagging issue of the titular seven dwarves.\n\nThe title proved toxic enough that Disney took the rare step of scaling back its premiere six days ahead of its release, limiting the media presence to talent-friendly in-house press. (Though not without precedent \u2013 Warner Bros acted similarly with the 2023 rollout for The Flash, premiering in the midst of star Ezra Miller\u2019s many scandals.) People have picked up on the fact that, well, the vibes are not good, with multiple reports that Disney is going through the motions to get it over and done with, stumbling to the finish line.\n\nHow did this bankable story become Disney\u2019s poisoned apple? Snow White has seemed cursed from the start, in part by Disney business logic and in part by the misfortune of landing in an environment hankering for disproportionate outrage. The issues began with the announcement of Zegler as the German fairytale princess who canonically (starting with the Brothers Grimm in 1812) possessed \u201cskin as white as snow\u201d. The new version revises the etymology, opening the tale with an explanation that she was named for surviving a snowstorm when she was an infant. (A similar story was used to explain the name of Ginnifer Goodwin\u2019s version of the character on the ABC fantasy series Once Upon a Time.) Rightwing commentators cried \u201cwoke\u201d, with plenty of straight-up racism and outright harassment, similar to the kind heaped on Halle Bailey, a Black actor and singer, after she was cast in the Little Mermaid in 2019, including physical harassment. \u201cThere was a lot of harassment from a certain group of people \u2013 they were showing up at my apartment and screaming profanities,\u201d Zegler, 23, told Cosmopolitan last year.\n\nThere was also pushback to Zegler\u2019s comments about the original film, largely taken out of context to show that she disrespected it. In line with the feminist-ish framings of Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast, Zegler marketed Snow White as a modern update of the 1937 film by pointing out that film\u2019s shortcomings. She called the original \u201cextremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power and what a woman is fit for\u201d and described it as \u201ccame out in 1937, and very evidently so\u201d with \u201ca big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her\u201d.\n\nSelling Snow White\u2019s agency only fanned the flames. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to be saved by the prince and she\u2019s not going to be dreaming about true love,\u201d she said at Disney\u2019s D23 meet-and-greet in 2022. \u201cShe\u2019s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true.\u201d In truth, there is a love interest for Snow White played by Broadway\u2019s Andrew Burnap, who certainly looks the part of Disney prince. But the specter of a downgraded Prince Charming triggered outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, from Twitter accounts with names like \u201cEnd Wokeness\u201d, Britain\u2019s Daily Mail and the US rightwing channel Daily Wire, which made its own anti-woke rival movie in response.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney caught flak for its handling of the seven dwarves. The actor Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, blasted the remake as \u201cfucking backwards\u201d. Though he praised Zegler\u2019s casting, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re progressive in one way but you\u2019re still making that fucking backward story of seven dwarves living in the cave. What the fuck are you doing, man?\u201d (Disney released a statement saying it had been \u201cconsulting with members of the dwarfism community\u201d to \u201cavoid reinforcing stereotypes\u201d.) Others criticized Disney for using CGI to create the seven \u201cmagical creatures,\u201d thus depriving dwarf performers of potential jobs. (Another Snow White spinoff, Snow White and the Huntsman, was criticized upon release in 2014 for casting actors of average height, including Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins, as the dwarves.)\n\nCreative issues kept the film in limbo as its budget ballooned to over $270m. Then the dual writers and actors strikes delayed its release a full year later. Meanwhile, Zegler found herself mired in even more controversy for publicly mourning Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 electoral victory on Instagram, writing that she hoped he and his supporters \u201cnever know peace\u201d. (The West Side Story actor later apologized \u2013 \u201cHatred and anger have caused us to move further and further away from peace and understanding, and I am sorry I contributed to the negative discourse,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram story.) Rumors abounded of bad blood between Zegler, who has supported Palestine during Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza, and Gadot, a vocal proponent of the Israeli military, and the film found itself at the intersection of another hot-blooded conflict; just this week, protesters from both sides disrupted Gadot\u2019s Walk of Fame ceremony in Hollywood.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rachel Zegler in Snow White. Photograph: Disney/AP\n\nAll of this has Disney appearing skittish. Advance ticket sales did not open until two weeks before the domestic premiere, an unusually small window. For comparison, Disney opened ticket sales for this past holidays\u2019 Mufasa: The Lion King and 2023 summer tentpole The Little Mermaid, the most recent Disney live-action features, a month in advance of their premieres. Then there was the pared-down US premiere, which the studio\u2019s said offered \u201ca more celebratory, family-friendly afternoon event to match the tone and target audience for the film\u201d. While Gadot made the rounds in New York, appearing on Good Morning America, Live With Kelly & Mark and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Zegler led the relatively quiet roll-out in Europe; instead of a splashy UK premiere, she performed an original song at a castle in Spain.\n\nBut the show goes on \u2013 both actors appeared all smiles at the US premiere, posing for photos together with the director Marc Webb. In a premiere-week interview with Allure, Zegler provided very media-trained appeals to kindness and tolerance. \u201cSnow White chooses kindness and still makes change,\u201d she said. \u201cPower takes many forms. I hope we\u2019ll see a new dawn of kindness and acceptance in the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nBad press aside, the story of Snow White is not yet written in stone. The film was met with lukewarm to positive reviews, with the Hollywood Reporter praising it as a \u201cmostly captivating\u201d update to the tale and the New York Times calling it \u201cperfectly adequate\u201d, and OK-enough box office projections. Most estimates have Snow White grossing about $40-50m in the US and over $100m globally \u2013 nowhere near the $357m made during Beauty and the Beast\u2019s opening weekend nor its $270m budget, but not a full flop. Its fortunes may still be improved by a relative lack of competition during a slow month for the box office, but that would also depend on its core base of viewers \u2013 mothers and daughters \u2013 showing up despite, not because of, controversy it has thus far failed to escape. The ultimate legacy of Snow White remains unwritten, but it enters its premiere weekend a troubled tale.",

CEO Bob Iger got a chance to respond directly to criticism surrounding Disney World fans\u2019 biggest complaints: expensive and crowded theme parks.\n\nIger answered shareholders for about 10 minutes during Thursday\u2019s annual shareholders meeting. At the meeting, Disney shareholders also rejected two politically loaded shareholder proposals asking the company to withdraw from an LGBT rights organization\u2019s corporate ratings and to study how Disney investments contribute to climate change.\n\nDuring the Q&A, one shareholder said Disney hasn\u2019t kept up with attendance demands and asked if Disney is also worried that high prices might keep guests from booking a return trip.\n\nIger acknowledged that the parks are packed.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I was just at Walt Disney World on actually a weekday in March, and the place was really busy \u2014 really across the whole property,\u201d Iger said.\n\nHowever, he argued the parks are expanding their capacity. Disney is building a Villains Land at the Magic Kingdom, a Cars attraction that\u2019s controversial with Disney fans, and more in Orlando.\n\n\u201cWe have more being designed, developed and built today than at any other point in the 70 years since we\u2019ve been in the theme park business,\u201d Iger said. \u201cWe also appreciate that our parks create lifelong memories for families. So with that in mind, we\u2019re constantly considering and developing and implementing new ways to make the experiences that we offer both more enjoyable, but of equal importance, more accessible.\u201d\n\nA one-day ticket at the Magic Kingdom ranges between $149-$169 in March and April, although the company offers discounted multiday tickets at a lower rate for Florida residents.\n\nTo keep the parks more accessible, Iger said Disney tripled the number of days that lower priced tickets were available when he returned as CEO two years ago\n\nCould Disney build more international theme parks?\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re mostly focused on expanding in places that we currently operate,\u201d Iger said when asked about it.\n\nHe quickly pivoted to the cruise business for Disney lovers around the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve plenty of opportunities to expand where we currently operate in our cruise ship business.\u201d\n\nIger was also asked about Figment, the purple dragon appearing on Epcot\u2019s Journey into Imagination ride. Hardcore fans once infamously waited up to seven hours to get a Figment popcorn bucket. That\u2019s how popular the character is.\n\nCan Figment get his own Disney movie?\n\n\u201cThis is my 24th shareholder call, my 18th as CEO. And I think the question about Figment has been asked about 15 times. I call him good old Figment,\u201d Iger said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019ve been asked this so many times that I am going to ask our creative teams to consider making some form of series or short-form videos of Figment. Obviously he\u2019s more popular than just a walk-around character in our parks and resorts.\u201d",

Yes, this is all true of the 2025 live-action remake \u2013 though the box-office outcome could yet surprise \u2013 and it was true 90 years ago, too. During production on the animated version, the schadenfreude was wildly premature, and those expecting it to capsize the company\u2019s fortunes could not have been more wrong.\n\nHollywood had called it \u201cDisney\u2019s Folly\u201d.

Disney even had to mortgage his own house to get it finished.\n\nOn all fronts, then, the turnaround when Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs reached the public at the end of 1937, defying all cynics, was extraordinary. The film would be an unparalleled triumph, the most important work of filmed animation ever made by pretty much any yardstick you could choose. Until Gone with the Wind (1939), it was the highest-grossing film of the sound era, and, adjusting for inflation, it remains the highest-grossing animated film in history.",

The original animated film was such a massive success when it was first released in 1937 that it more or less invented the genre of not just the Disney princess movie, but also the Disney feature-length animated movie, and all the copies thereof that followed. Some of the tropes it innovated are still fundamental to what we think an animated movie should look like, for no better reason than the fact that Snow White did them nearly 90 years ago.\n\nRelated How Disney found itself in the middle of a culture war\n\nIn response, Disney has tamped down its marketing machine, restricting press on the red carpet, sending its leading ladies to exclusively friendly outlets, and offering a reduced window for ticket sales compared to previous live-action releases. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that, for Hollywood insiders, Disney\u2019s attitude screams, \u201cWe need to get this thing over with. \u2026 We have zero faith.\u201d\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

In defining the genre, it also shaped childhood for generations of Americans. The Walt Disney Corporation might be the house that Mickey Mouse built, but he did it on Snow White\u2019s dime.\n\nHow Snow White went from \u201cDisney\u2019s Folly\u201d to Disney\u2019s greatest success\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs advertisement, 1937.\n\nFrom the outside, Snow White had all the makings of a boondoggle. No one had ever made a feature-length animated film before it, and looking at the silly, squishy, fluorescent cartoons of the era, it was hard to imagine why anyone would want to sit through one that lasted over an hour. Cartoons are good for a giggle, but who wants one that stretches on forever? Still, Walt Disney was determined to make an animated feature that would be easy to sit through, that would have genuine artistic merit. Getting the medium to that point would prove to be expensive.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Disney turned his animation studio into what was essentially a laboratory for how to make a great animated film. He had long considered his \u201cSilly Symphony\u201d shorts to be the artistic cousin to the slapstick Mickey Mouse shorts, and now he was taking them more seriously than ever. He poured money into figure drawing lessons for his animators, into classes on the art of the great European fairy tale illustrators, into studies on how the play of light should look in animation. He paid for huge and expensive leaps forward in technology, most notoriously the creation of a multi-plane camera that allowed for new levels of depth and perspective within a single frame.\n\nWalt Disney was determined to make an animated feature that would be easy to sit through, that would have genuine artistic merit.\n\nIn the end, Snow White cost $1.5 million in 1937 dollars, about $34 million today. Newspapers of the time called Snow White \u201cDisney\u2019s folly.\u201d Instead, when Snow White made it to theaters, it became a smash hit.\n\nAudiences reportedly burst into tears when they saw Snow White lying in the glass coffin, surrounded by weeping dwarves. The premiere was greeted with a standing ovation. Sergei Eisenstein, the Soviet director who invented montage, declared it \u201cthe greatest film ever made.\u201d It grossed $66 million at the box office, becoming briefly the highest-grossing sound picture ever until Gone with the Wind premiered two years later.\n\nBefore Snow White, no one had ever managed to make animation so naturalistic and expressive. The animation in short films up until that point had been silly, vaudeville-inflected; mostly featuring animals because humans were too hard to draw in an appealing way \u2014 mostly with static and unchanging expressions, on flat, simplistic backgrounds. But Snow White took place in a deep, rich, painterly world, and Snow White herself was a charming, beautiful human figure who could blush and laugh and cry in ways that made the audience blush and laugh and cry right back at her. It was an entirely new effect, one to which people responded powerfully.\n\nOne surprising thing In the 1937 Snow White, not all the human characters were as naturalistic as Walt Disney would have liked. The Prince\u2019s role was minimized as much as possible because Disney felt they could never quite get his face right. Watch it again and you\u2019ll see what he meant.\n\nBut Snow White also had commercial appeal in a way that seemed to flummox Disney, and that took him a while to figure out how to duplicate. He continued developing Snow White\u2019s animation style over his next two features, 1940\u2019s Pinocchio and Fantasia, both of which arguably surpassed Snow White in artistic accomplishment \u2014 but also failed to make money. The massive success of Snow White bought Disney enough credit that he could keep taking out loans to finance his ever-more-expensive films, but after Fantasia, the company was near bankruptcy.\n\nDisney made Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942) on the cheap, abandoning the expensive oil painting look of his first three films for a more stylized, pencil-stroke-heavy animation style that could be churned out quickly. The company kept floating through World War II on the strength of a series of military propaganda films, but it wouldn\u2019t achieve a true box office smash again until 1950, when it released Cinderella, a movie that followed carefully in the footsteps of Snow White.\n\nIn a world where the two highest-grossing Disney films were Snow White and Cinderella, the matter became settled: A successful Disney movie would look like Snow White. Even today, after Pixar, after fully rendered animation, after Frozen, it still does.\n\nHow Disney learned the Snow White formula\n\nA Snow White character acts in Mickey\u2019s Soundsational Parade at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, on Friday, May 24, 2013. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDisney occasionally messes with the formula, but the great classics of the studio tend to follow this basic template set by Snow White 90 years ago.\n\nSnow White was a musical because commercial films in 1937 were musicals. In today\u2019s Hollywood, musicals aren\u2019t commercial guarantees, but we still think of music as being fundamental to the Disney formula. Snow White begins the movie by wishing for her prince to come and the prince singing back to her \u2014 now Disney movies tend to give their protagonist an \u201cI want\u201d song and the lovers a duet. Snow White doesn\u2019t have a villain song, but the Evil Queen is so fabulously campy that songs like \u201cPoor Unfortunate Souls\u201d are a natural extension of the legacy she began.\n\nNot all Disney animated movies are about princesses or even based on fairy tales, but in unprofitable periods, Disney generally turns to a princess to turn things around. The Little Mermaid in 1989 rocketed the studio out of its so-called dark age and into the Disney Renaissance, and after a slump in the 2000s, Disney leaned hard into the princess formula with The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, and Frozen. Disney fairy tales tend to be gently bowdlerized and made sentimental (Snow White didn\u2019t wake up because of true love\u2019s kiss until Disney got their hands on her), and to this day, the studio loves adding a didactic moral lesson to their tales, like the lesson in Snow White that love conquers all.\n\nSnow White had cute animal sidekicks as well as comic magical ones; both would become a staple of Disney storytelling going forward. Snow White\u2019s blue and yellow and red gown would become her signature outfit, an increasingly important piece of Disney\u2019s visual iconography and of the princesses that followed. Snow White even innovated the classic Disney strategy of keeping the hero\u2019s hands clean by having the villain die accidentally, falling from a great height in the middle of a crescendo of evil laughter.\n\nWhat Disney left behind following Snow White were some of its most stylized elements. At moments, the animation plays with the jagged, aggressive lines of German Expressionism: When Snow White runs into the wild forest, the trees loom out of the darkness and the eyes of wild animals flash at her in lurid, vicious cuts. Disney would continue to play with this aesthetic in Pinocchio and Fantasia, which is part of why they are largely considered to be his scariest films, but later animated features would smooth out such frightening scenes into gentler, less thrilling action sequences.\n\nDisney would also abandon the part of Snow White that plays most strangely for modern audiences. As critic Caroline Siede has written, Snow White is constructed like a classical opera or a ballet, with static, unchanging characters. You might think of Snow White as a figure like Pamina, the ingenue in The Magic Flute: she\u2019s at the center of the plot, but all she does is fall in love over the course of a single duet, and she never really changes after that. Her funny magic sidekick and villainous mother figure steal the show. In later films, Disney would embrace a more cinematic style of storytelling, with characters who want more than true love and who have to overcome some internal flaw in order to get what they want.\n\nThe first Snow White was like nothing that anyone had ever seen before. The new Snow White is a cinematic cliche.\n\nThe new live-action Snow White plays as an uncanny attempt to retroactively apply this formula to Disney\u2019s oldest and strongest story. In the new film, Snow White wants to protect her kingdom from the selfish Evil Queen, but to save the day, she has to overcome her fear and self-doubt. She still sings \u201cWaiting on a Wish\u201d by the wishing well, but now she sings about how much she wants to be brave. All the updates are so generic that in the end, the whole thing reads as storytelling by committee.\n\nYet as Disney attempts to update its storytelling, it leaves behind the part of Snow White that had those first audiences sobbing in their seats: that ravishing, painterly, glorious hand-drawn animation. The first Snow White was like nothing that anyone had ever seen before. The new Snow White is a cinematic clich\u00e9.",

            "content": "\u201cSomeday, my prince will come\u2026\u201d So sang Adriana Caelotti in the Depression-era classic, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the film that proved Walt Disney was more than Mickey Mouse. Some 90 years later, amidst a wave of cash-grabs that have seen far too many of the Magic Kingdom\u2019s animated treasures exploited via live-action \u201cre-creations,\u201d someone decided it was Snow White\u2019s turn. But, because mores have changed (which is to be expected considering the span of time), the film\u2019s signature tune \u2013 ranked #19 on the all-time movie song list \u2013 had to be jettisoned because the writers of the new movie couldn\u2019t figure out a way to include it without demeaning their newly minted vision of the title character. That exemplifies the problem faced by the filmmakers. The 1937 production casts too long a shadow to escape from with a radically changed approach and much of what played well to our grandparents and great-grandparents simply won\u2019t work in the 2020s.\n\nThe obvious answer would have been not to remake Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Let it continue to exist in that animated fantasy bubble. Truth be told, outside of the technical achievement of being the first feature-length animated film, it\u2019s not a great movie (at least for adults). But Disney has become too greedy to leave any stone unturned even when it involves tarnishing one of its most beloved jewels. So, despite growing headwinds against these cartoon-to-live-action remakes, Snow White entered the process.\n\nAll that is past prologue and \u201cwoulda coulda shoulda\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much. The movie exists and the best I can say about it is it\u2019s fitfully entertaining but feels as plastic and artificial as most of the other animated Disney remakes. No better, no worse. The biggest standout among this new wave of titles, Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Cinderella, worked because the director opted for a true re-imagination (with no songs) \u2013 something none of the other high-profile regurgitations have attempted. When Beauty and the Beast made a ton of money, the die was cast. And it\u2019s still rolling.\n\nMany of Snow White\u2019s story beats are familiar: Princess Snow White (Rachel Zegler) escapes from the clutches of her evil stepmother (Gal Gadot) and flees into a mystical forest. She is pursued by the queen\u2019s Huntsman (Ansu Kabia), who has been tasked with killing her and bringing back her heart in a jewelry box. But the Huntsman spares her life and she soon finds sanctuary at the cottage of the seven CGI dwarfs: Doc (Jeremy Swift), Grumpy (Martin Klebba), Dopey (Andrew Barth Feldman), Bashful (Tituss Burgess), Happy (George Salazar), Sneezy (Jason Kravits), and Sleepy (Andy Grotelueschen). After helping them clean the house, she heads out to banter with Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), a local Robin Hood-type outlaw who fills the love interest role since Prince Charming is M.I.A. in this version.\n\nErin Cressida Wilson\u2019s treatment introduces two narrative hiccups. The first relates to the fate of Snow White\u2019s father, the King (Hadley Fraser), whose possible continued existence provides a story point until it\u2019s unceremoniously dropped. Then there\u2019s the anti-climactic reworked ending, which postulates a different downfall for the Queen from the 1937 movie (where she fell off a cliff) and the fairy tale (where she dances to death in a pair of molten iron slippers).\n\nThere\u2019s no reason why Snow White needs to be a musical except that Disney has apparently decided that\u2019s a necessary direction for these movies (the exceptional Cinderella notwithstanding). Three of the 1937 Larry Morey/Frank Churchill songs have survived (\u201cHeigh Ho!\u201d, \u201cWhistle While You Work\u201d, and \u201cThe Silly Song\u201d) but more were needed so the production team hired Benj Pasek and Justin Paul to contribute a half-dozen utterly forgettable tunes that no one will be humming or whistling while they work. Attempting to mitigate the absence of \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come,\u201d instrumental strains of the song can be heard as part of the underscore (if you\u2019re listening carefully enough, which I wasn\u2019t, so I\u2019m taking their word for it).\n\nPutting aside the various off-screen issues related to Rachel Zegler, the actress is arguably the best live-action Snow White (her main competition being Lily Collins in Mirror, Mirror and Kristen Stewart in Snow White and the Huntsman). She exudes pluckiness and can sing, which are the two primary requirements for the role. Gal Gadot is rather embarrassing as the one-note queen, although the screenplay doesn\u2019t do her any favors. She\u2019s a step up from Charlize Theron in Huntsman but a notch below Julia Roberts in Mirror, Mirror. The dwarfs get the CGI treatment, allowing them to weirdly resemble their animated counterparts. (It can\u2019t be a coincidence, however, that Dopey is a dead ringer for Mad Magazine\u2019s Alfred E. Neuman.) Andrew Burnap, playing Bandit King Jonathan, gets to kiss Zegler but displays little in the way of chemistry with her or charisma in his own right.\n\nSnow White is not the abomination some naysayers hoped it would be. It\u2019s competently made and proves to be an adequate diversion for adults who like movie musicals. Younger viewers will most likely adore it, although it\u2019s questionable how many will remember it for long. And more than a few will ask about the changes when they watch the animated version on Disney+. It\u2019s disposable entertainment that will put some spare change in the distributor\u2019s coffers while never coming close to replacing its venerable antecedent in viewers' hearts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSnow White (United States, 2025)",

Magic Kingdom's expansion, the park's largest to date, will include a Cars-themed area and a Villains-themed land. Disney's Hollywood Studios will see the addition of a Monsters Inc.-themed land, while Disney's Animal Kingdom is progressing with the Tropical Americas expansion, featuring experiences based on Encanto and Indiana Jones.\n\n\n\nIger also acknowledged ongoing work at Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris, both of which were previously detailed at D23. Disney California Adventure's Avengers Campus is set to double in size with two new attractions, and the park will gain a new ride-through experience themed to Coco, along with a dedicated Avatar-themed area. Meanwhile, Disneyland Paris will introduce the first-ever Lion King-themed ride, with Pride Rock serving as the gateway to a Simba-focused water attraction. \"We can't wait for guests to experience this retelling of the classic animated film,\" Iger said.\n\n\n\nDisney Cruise Line's expansion was also highlighted, with Iger confirming that following the Disney Treasure's debut in 2024, the Disney Destiny and Disney Adventure are both scheduled to enter service later this year. \"Disney Cruise Line is also growing, allowing us to double our capacity to reach millions more people around the world,\" Iger said.\n\nWhile no major new announcements were made, Iger underscored the broader impact of these projects. \"We're proud of the positive economic impact these projects will have in the communities in which we operate, including creating thousands of new jobs in Florida and California,\" he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Behind the red carpet movie premieres and new thrill-inducing rides for fans of its amusement parks, there is a quiet search underway to find the successor to Bob Iger, the face of Disney for most of the past two decades.\n\nDisney went through the CEO search recently, and it was nearly a disaster.\n\nOnly two years after stepping down as CEO, Iger returned to Disney in 2022 after a period of clashes, missteps and a weakening financial performance under his hand-picked successor, Bob Chapek.\n\nBut how do you replace a chief executive who is considered by many to be the gold standard?\n\nIger strengthened the Disney brand through his acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, oversaw the expansion of the company in China and India and had a laser-like focus on technology that both made the Disney product better, and more accessible. Iger, at the same time, is approachable, media savvy and has deftly managed a company that is like no other.\n\nUnder Disney\u2019s umbrella are theme parks, movies studios and streaming technology, all with priorities seemingly at odds with each other, or at least vying for the attention of the company\u2019s chief executive.\n\nDisney did not provide succession updates at its annual shareholders meeting on Thursday. Still, the question of who can follow Iger remains on investors\u2019 minds.\n\nDisney created a succession planning committee in 2023, but the search began in earnest last year when the company enlisted Morgan Stanley Executive Chairman James Gorman to lead the effort.\n\nGorman said in a January letter to shareholders that the committee had made \u201cstrong progress\u201d over the past year.\n\n\u201cThe full board is engaged in and committed to finding the right leader for the company and we are planning for a smooth leadership transition that will enable Disney\u2019s continued success,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDisney does has the benefit of time. After signing a two-year contract mostly to right Disney\u2019s trajectory after a rocky two years under his hand-picked successor, Iger agreed to a contract extension that keeps him at Disney through the end of 2026.\n\nDisney declined to comment on its succession planning efforts.\n\nIt is a broad search. Disney is looking inside and outside of the company. Internal candidates are being mentored by Iger, interacting with the company\u2019s 15 board members (including Iger) and receiving external coaching.\n\nThe internal candidates are widely believed to include the chairman of Disney-owned ESPN, Jimmy Pitaro, Chairperson of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Josh D\u2019Amaro, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden.\n\nIndividuals on that short list are notably more visible at a time in which Iger has taken a bit of a step back from pubic appearances. Walden appeared at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference this month to speak about varying components of the business.\n\n\u201cDisney is a great technology company and a great storytelling company,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have moved forward significantly throughout time, embracing technology as a vital tool to deliver these stories.\u201d\n\nBergman and D\u2019Amaro showed up at the South by Southwest festival this month to discuss collaborative efforts taking place at Disney.\n\nGiven the complex and unique nature of Disney, many expect the next leader of the company to come from within.\n\n\u201cInternal candidates make sense when a company doesn\u2019t need a major shake-up and when the bench of potential candidates is deep,\u201d Jason Schloetzer, associate professor at Georgetown McDonough School of Business, said.\n\nHenning Piezunka, associate professor of management at Wharton Business School of the University of Pennsylvania, agrees.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for Disney \u2013 but also the beauty of it, is that it is a somewhat unique company,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile it is very feasible for Ford to recruit from GM, and for Volkswagen to recruit from BMW, it is less evident what is an equivalent for Disney. So, it is harder for an external CEO to hit the ground running.\u201d\n\nYet is there anyone on Disney\u2019s roster that can oversee parks, films and streaming as adeptly as Iger has?\n\nSchloetzer said that Walden\u2019s experience in television and streaming positions her well for the CEO post, although she lacks experience with the company\u2019s theme parks.\n\nWith D\u2019Amaro, Disney has someone who has been with the company for almost 30 years and who has deep experience with the theme park division, he said.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the choice will probably come down to which candidate the board feels most comfortable working with and who can motivate the next level of executives to push the company forward,\u201d Schloetzer said.\n\nDisney has been energized of late. The company was buoyed in its first quarter by the strong box office performance of \u201cMoana 2\u201d and subscriber growth at Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nAnd the entertainment giant is continuing to double down on some of its most successful titles. Iger on Thursday announced that a sequel of Pixar\u2019s \u201cCoco\u201d is officially in the works, for example. While that film is in its initial stages, he also pointed to popular TV series set to return with new seasons in the coming year, such as FX\u2019s \u201cThe Bear\u201d and Hulu\u2019s \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s meeting also spotlighted other growth efforts \u2014 including updates on an ESPN \u201cdirect to consumer\u201d offering set to debut this fall and expansions across various Disney-owned parks and cruises.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have more projects underway around the world than at any time in our history,\u201d Iger said in prepared remarks.\n\nAnd beyond updates from Iger, Disney shareholders voted on several proposals Thursday. Of note, shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal requesting that the company end its participation in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index \u2014 a measure of workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees that several other big names, including Ford and Lowe\u2019s, have recently cut ties with amid wider attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nDisney\u2019s board previously recommended that shareholders vote against this measure. It received approval of just 1% in a preliminary count Thursday.\n\n_____\n\nAP Business Writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips contributed to this report from New York.",

There are five other animated remakes currently in development, and at some point, Disney\u2019s going to run out of movies to make twice!\n\nTo mark Snow White\u2019s arrival in theaters on Friday, we\u2019ve ranked every Disney live-action remake. There are some caveats, however. This list is limited to the actual remakes, rather than prequels, spinoffs, and sequels. The so-called live-action Lion King is also excluded, since it wasn\u2019t live-action at all. It was just made with some very realistic CGI, and it belongs among animated films rather than in this roundup of live-action Disney remakes. With that in the mind, here is the official Gold Derby ranking, from worst to first.\n\n14. Pinocchio (2022)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 27 percent\n\nMetacritic: 38 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: N/A\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nWhere\u2019s the Robert Zemeckis who made Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Because there\u2019s very little of that guy in Disney+\u2019s live-action remake of Pinocchio. While very technically proficient, and even visually impressive at times, this film simply goes through the motions of the story without recapturing any of its soul.\n\nTom Hanks is largely wasted as Geppetto, and Wicked\u2019s Cynthia Erivo has what amounts to a cameo as the Blue Fairy. Most of this film relies on the performance of Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as the voice of Pinocchio, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as pal and conscience Jiminy Cricket. We\u2019ll say this for Pinocchio: Pleasure Island\u2019s true nature is still unsettling in the remake.\n\n13. Dumbo (2019)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 46 percent\n\nMetacritic: 51 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $353.3 million\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nDumbo is Tim Burton\u2019s most recent film for Disney, and quite likely his last, according to the director himself. Some of his other remakes took bold swings that improved upon the original Disney cartoons. Dumbo wasn\u2019t one of those movies, and it\u2019s vastly inferior to the 1941 film. Heck, we\u2019d pick Operation Dumbo Drop over this one!\n\nBurton had a great cast to work with, including Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Eva Green, and Danny DeVito. However, the human side of the story completely overshadows Dumbo in his own movie. There are also plenty of baffling dramatic choices, including an ending where the circus decides to forgo the use of animal performers in favor of people dressed up as animals. This is supposed to be 1919, not the 2020s.\n\n12. 101 Dalmatians (1996)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 39 percent\n\nMetacritic: 50 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $320.7 million\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nCasting Glenn Close as Cruella de Vil was a truly inspired choice, and John Hughes\u2019 script stays pretty close to the plot of the 1961 film and Dodie Smith\u2019s original story. House\u2019s Hugh Laurie pops up in a fun turn as Jasper, one of Cruella\u2019s henchmen. This remake didn\u2019t win over critics, but audiences loved it.\n\nWhere the movie really loses something special is due to the decision to keep the animals from speaking English as they did in the original cartoon. The animal actors are very expressive, but it\u2019s just not the same. The film also unforgivably erases the heroic actions of the animated feature\u2019s sole feline character, Sergeant Tibbs. That alone deserves a very loud hiss.\n\n11. Peter Pan & Mary (2023)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 65 percent\n\nMetacritic: 61 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: N/A\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nThe familiar rivalry between Peter Pan (Alexander Molony) and Captain Hook (Jude Law) gets a little touchy-feely in Peter Pan & Mary, the last of the Disney+ original live-action remakes... at least for now. Law does seem like he was the right choice to play Hook, but he loses some of the character\u2019s wonderfully over-the-top villainous swagger when the one-handed captain reveals his real connection to Peter.\n\nAs for Wendy (Ever Anderson), she and her brothers join Peter on a trip to Neverland to explore the promise of never having to grow up. This film trips all over itself while trying to avoid the racist stereotypes of the 1953 original, and it\u2019s just not as much fun to watch.\n\n10. Lady and the Tramp (2019)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 67 percent\n\nMetacritic: 48 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: N/A\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nDisney+\u2019s first-ever original movie was the remake of Lady and the Tramp, and it\u2019s largely faithful to the 1955 animated film. While previous live-action adaptations shied away from talking animals, this film let Lady (Tessa Thompson) and Tramp (Justin Theroux) keep their voices. And it wouldn\u2019t have worked without them.\n\nIt was unintentionally hilarious that Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham plays the man who lovingly serves spaghetti and meatballs to Lady and the Tramp, And this film did pay more of its attention to its human cast, including Thomas Mann and Kiersey Clemons as Lady\u2019s owners. It\u2019s good enough as a movie, but it doesn\u2019t outshine the original.\n\n9. Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1994)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 80 percent\n\nMetacritic: 63 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $70 million\n\nStreaming: N/A (available to buy/rent on most digital platforms)\n\nThis film has the distinction of being the first live-action remake of a Disney animated film, as well as writer and director Stephen Sommers\u2019 warm-up for The Mummy movies a few years later. Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book doesn\u2019t try to ape the plot of the 1967 film, if you\u2019ll pardon the expression. Instead, it primarily tells the story of Mowgli (Jason Scott Lee) after he\u2019s reunited with his childhood friend Katherine \"Kitty\" Brydon (Game of Thrones\u2019 Lena Headey), while also dealing with treacherous treasure hunters who disrupt the jungle.\n\nIt\u2019s a solid adventure flick with a great cast, including Cary Elwes, Sam Neill, John Cleese, and Jason Flemyng, as well as real animals instead of CGI creations. The only knock against this Jungle Book is that it isn\u2019t very faithful to either the Disney film or Rudyard Kipling's stories.\n\n8. Cinderella (2015)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 84 percent\n\nMetacritic: 67 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $542.4 million\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nUnlike some of the other live-action remakes, Cinderella doesn\u2019t try to reinvent the original story of the 1950 toon. Director Kenneth Branagh may not have gone with Disney\u2019s talking mice, but Ella (Lily James) still gets her chance to dance with the prince (Richard Madden), thanks to her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter).\n\nCate Blanchett hammed it up as Lady Tremaine, Ella\u2019s evil stepmother, but that was exactly what the role needed. This isn\u2019t the most spectacular Disney remake, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with it either.\n\n7. Alice in Wonderland (2010)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 51 percent\n\nMetacritic: 53 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $1.03 billion\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nThere\u2019s one thing that anyone can say after watching Alice in Wonderland: \u201cThat was definitely a Tim Burton movie.\u201d Lewis Carroll\u2019s famous story, originally adapted by Disney in 1951, was completely reimagined for this film, and Mia Wasikowska had a star-making turn as Alice Kingsleigh, a young woman who finds herself transported to Wonderland.\n\nAs part of the story\u2019s remix, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) became more of a heroic figure, and Alice was called upon to free Wonderland from the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), restore the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to power, and defeat the Jabberwocky (Christopher Lee). As she says in the movie, Alice does six impossible things before breakfast. About the only thing she couldn't do is make the sequel, Alice Through the Looking Glass, as fun or as successful as this one.\n\n6. Mulan (2020)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 72 percent\n\nMetacritic:66 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $69 million\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nMulan was beset by numerous factors beyond the control of the filmmakers, including the COVID-19 pandemic, fan reaction to some of the creative changes, and even remarks by the movie\u2019s leading lady, Yifei Liu, when she came out against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. And you wouldn\u2019t believe the kerfuffle that happened when Mulan\u2019s commanding officer and love interest, Li Shang, was cut from the film.\n\nTaken on its own terms, the Mulan remake has some incredible visuals, good action, and a scale that few Disney live-action movies have achieved. Die-hard fans of the 1998 original might have been discontented with Mulan, but this still ranks among the best of the remakes.\n\n5. The Little Mermaid (2023)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 67 percent\n\nMetacritic:59 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $569.6 million\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nThe Little Mermaid sinks or swims with its Ariel, and Halle Bailey holds up her end of the bargain by singing her way through the remake. There are parts of this film that are visually dazzling, but it still can\u2019t compare to one of the greatest animated features ever made.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many major changes between the two versions of The Little Mermaid, but this one does reveal that Ariel is related to the sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy), which ultimately doesn\u2019t make a difference in the outcome of the story. But if you\u2019ve ever loved the songs and music of 1989's The Little Mermaid, they\u2019re all back again for the current generation along with new songs by Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\n4. Maleficent (2016)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 54 percent\n\nMetacritic: 56 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $758.5 million\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nIn a departure from the previous Disney remakes, Maleficent casts the villain of the original as the (anti)hero. Unlike Maleficent\u2019s delightful and unrepentantly evil turn in 1959's Sleeping Beauty, Angelina Jolie\u2019s take on the character is presented as a woman who was violated by her former suitor, Stegan (Sharlto Copley). He ripped the wings from her body so he could become a king and marry another woman. To get her revenge, Maleficent crashes the christening of his daughter, Aurora, and places the familiar curse on the infant that will strike on her 16th birthday.\n\nWhen Aurora (Elle Fanning) becomes a teenager, things diverge even further from the original tale when Maleficent develops maternal feelings for her. But not even Maleficent can break her own curse. Unfortunately, the success of this film emboldened Disney to make a sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, which couldn\u2019t live up to its predecessor.\n\n3. Aladdin (2019)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 57 percent\n\nMetacritic: 53 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $1.05 billion\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nThe animated Aladdin is one of the best movies from Disney Animation. Guy Ritchie\u2019s remake can\u2019t match the 1992 version, but it\u2019s still pretty good. And audiences responded to it by making it one of the top-performing Disney remakes.\n\nNo one could compare to the late Robin Willims, but Will Smith was an intriguing choice to bring something new to the part of Genie. This was only the second film of Mena Massoud\u2019s career, but he did an admirable job as Aladdin. Yet the real breakout here is Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine, who\u2019s so assertive that she basically banishes two guards who were holding her into oblivion for the duration of her power ballad.\n\n2. Beauty and the Beast (2017)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 71 percent\n\nMetacritic: 65 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $1.27 billion\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nDisney\u2019s 1991 Beauty and the Beast was Oscar-nominated for Best Picture and pretty much perfect the first time. Director Bill Condon wisely didn\u2019t rock the boat with his 2017 remake, which largely recreates the big moments from the first film and all of those amazing songs by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken.\n\nEmma Watson lights up the screen as Belle, and Dan Stevens was a worthy Beast to her beauty. Luke Evans chowed on scenery as the wonderfully over-the-top Gaston, Belle\u2019s would-be suitor and the film\u2019s true villain. The only real shock in this movie was that someone in the prince\u2019s court was transformed into a toilet for decades. What did they do to deserve that fate?! And thankfully, the toilet doesn\u2019t have any musical numbers.\n\n1. The Jungle Book (2016)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 94 percent\n\nMetacritic: 77 percent\n\nWorldwide box office: $967 million\n\nStreaming: Disney+\n\nJon Favreau\u2019s remake of The Jungle Book didn\u2019t make the same choices that Stephen Sommers did with his 1994 film, and the result was a movie that was a lot closer in spirit to the Disney original. Favreau cast a real kid, Neel Sethi, to play Mowgli, while letting an A-list ensemble of celebrities voice the CGI animals.\n\nBill Murray, Ben Kingsley, and Idris Elba are particularly compelling as Ballo, Bagheera, and Shere Khan, but the rest of the voice cast \u2014 including Scarlett Johansson, Lupita Nyong'o, Giancarlo Esposito, and Christopher Walken \u2014 are all terrific. This is easily Disney\u2019s best live-action remake, and it has yet to be topped.\n\nBased on the decidedly mixed reviews for Snow White, Favreau's The Jungle Book will remain on top for the foreseeable future.",

Disney movies grossed $5.5 billion overall in worldwide box office in 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company also reached profitability for the first time in its streaming businesses, which include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.\n\nBut Disney\u2019s experiences division, which includes its theme parks, cruise line and merchandise, ended 2024 with more muted growth due to inflation, expansion costs for the cruise line and softer results at its international parks.\n\nThe House of Mouse has recently tried to stay out of political culture wars, particularly as the Trump administration has targeted corporate diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nThere was no explicit discussion of Disney\u2019s DEI efforts during the Thursday meeting. The company focused on upcoming projects, including an extended scene from its upcoming live-action film \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d a clip from a new FX series called \u201cAlien: Earth\u201d and the announcement of the \u201cCoco\u201d sequel, which Iger said was still in \u201cinitial stages.\u201d\n\nIger also teased the upcoming ESPN flagship streaming product and gave updates on additions to the company\u2019s parks segment, which he said had \u201cmore projects underway around the world than at any time in our history.\u201d\n\nAt Florida theme parks, those include a new \u201cCars\u201d themed area and villains-themed land in the Orlando Walt Disney World\u2019s Magic Kingdom, a \u201cMonsters, Inc.\u201d themed area in Hollywood Studios and a tropical Americas land in Animal Kingdom that will feature \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d and \u201cEncanto\u201d attractions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Anaheim\u2019s Disney California Adventure, he noted plans for an expanded Avengers Campus, a new \u201cCoco\u201d-themed ride and an \u201cAvatar\u201d-inspired area that were previously announced at fan convention D23 last year. Iger said the new projects in Florida and California would bring \u201cthousands of new jobs\u201d to the two states.\n\nIn response to a shareholder question about increasing capacity and maintaining affordability at the parks \u2014 a key question for analysts, investors and fans prior to the meeting \u2014 Iger pointed to \u201cseveral options for families looking to spend less,\u201d including Disneyland\u2019s lowest-priced ticket, which costs the same as it did before the pandemic. He also said the company has tripled the number of days that type of ticket was available.\n\nOne hot topic not broached was the company\u2019s plans for Iger\u2019s successor. Though Disney has signaled it won\u2019t name the next Disney chief until early 2026, investors and analysts have said they are eager for more details about how the search is progressing.\n\nDisney Entertainment Co-Chair Dana Walden, fellow Entertainment Co-Chair Alan Bergman, parks, products and experiences Chair Josh D\u2019Amaro and ESPN boss James Pitaro are all seen as potential internal successors.",

Disney will share the final results in a filing next week.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company on Thursday held its annual shareholders meeting, during which the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, asked them to stop using the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index as a benchmark. The index measures companies by policies, benefits, and practices that support LGBTQ+ employees.\n\n\"When corporations take extreme positions, they destroy shareholder value by alienating large portions of their customers and investors. This proposal provides Disney with an opportunity to move back to neutral,\" the think tank said in a note included in the shareholder's proxy statement.\n\nAhead of Thursday's meeting, Disney's board recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal, writing in the proxy statement that they didn't believe the think tank's request \"would provide additional value to shareholders.\"\n\nDisney has had a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index every year since 2007. However, that support for the LGBTQ+ community, both within Disney and outside Disney, has come at a cost.\n\nIn 2022, the company publicly opposed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" bill , which bans discussing gender and sexuality in schools. DeSantis lashed out at the entertainment conglomerate, ultimately upending a long-standing arrangement that allowed Disney to self-govern through its Reedy Creek Improvement District.\n\nDeSantis gained control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District and renamed it the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District. He appointed its board supervisors, effectively removing Disney's autonomy over development in the area.\n\nPressure on companies to roll back DEI initiatives increased when President Donald Trump took office in January. The president immediately signed an executive order to end diversity programs in the federal government and ordered federal DEI staffers to be placed on leave while their departments were cut.\n\nMajor companies, like Walmart and Target, have rolled back DEI initiatives amid that new pressure. Other companies have resisted.\n\nIn January, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal to report on the potential risks of its DEI efforts. One month later, shareholders at Apple rejected a proposal to cut its DEI programs. Both of those proposals were made by the National Center for Public Policy Research.\n\nEric Bloem, the vice president of corporate citizenship at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, said in a statement that the \"vote gives us a clear statement of values from Disney's shareholders.\"\n\n\"Despite the growing politicization of DEI and workplace inclusion, leading global businesses remain committed to the belief that a welcoming, inclusive environment drives innovation, boosts productivity, and strengthens the bottom line,\" he said.",

Disney has also recently tried to stay out of political culture wars, particularly as the Trump administration has targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts within corporations.\n\nAhead of the company\u2019s shareholder meeting Thursday morning, The Times spoke with analysts and investors about what they want the company to address.\n\nThe CEO succession plan\n\nThough Disney has signaled it won\u2019t name a successor to Chief Executive Bob Iger until early 2026, investors and analysts are eager for more details about how the search is progressing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney Entertainment Co-Chair Dana Walden, fellow Entertainment Co-Chair Alan Bergman, parks, products and experiences Chair Josh D\u2019Amaro and ESPN boss James Pitaro are all seen as potential internal successors.\n\nDisney\u2019s newly appointed chairman of the board, former Morgan Stanley executive chairman James P. Gorman, leads the CEO succession planning committee. The company said in its proxy statement that management succession planning \u201cremains a top priority for the board.\u201d\n\nFinding the right successor for Iger, 74, is key to the company\u2019s future stability. The firm fumbled in its last attempt to find a replacement for Iger; now-former CEO Bob Chapek lasted less than three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, began reducing the firm\u2019s Disney shares after Iger\u2019s departure. Though the firm\u2019s portfolio does not currently include shares of Disney, Mulberry is keeping a close eye on the stock price and wants to get clarity on some of the company\u2019s financial issues before coming to a new position.\n\n\u201cWith Bob Iger on his way out, \u2018Who\u2019s going to right the ship\u2019 is what we\u2019re particularly looking for in the meeting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prolonged ambiguity about the succession plan is making investors antsy, said Laurent Yoon, senior analyst at Bernstein.\n\n\u201cBob Iger already came back more than two years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThat uncertainty is not any clearer than before.\u201d\n\nParks and recession fears\n\nDisney\u2019s experiences division, which includes its theme parks, cruise line and merchandise, ended 2024 with more muted growth due to inflation, expansion costs for the cruise line and softer results at its international parks.\n\nThe company will also face greater competition in Florida this summer when rival Comcast Corp. opens its Epic Universe theme park in Orlando \u2014 something analysts have frequently queried Disney executives about during earnings calls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney said during its fourth-quarter earnings call in November that it expected to see 6% to 8% growth in operating income this year from its experiences division. But amid growing economic pessimism and fears of a recession, analysts and investors will be looking to see how the company addresses these potential threats to consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThis summer is a very important season for Disney because [the parks business is] expected to recover, and if there\u2019s a recession, then that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Yoon, who maintains a \u201cBuy\u201d rating for the company\u2019s stock. \u201cThere will be questions around what Disney would do in case there seems to be some macro headwinds.\u201d\n\nEven before concerns about an economic downturn took hold, there were growing questions about the affordability of a Disney vacation. Ticket prices at the parks have increased over the years.\n\nGavin Doyle, who has owned a small number of Disney shares since 2009, will be keeping an ear out for any mentions of discount offers, special promotions or even new details about expansions at the parks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of levers they can pull ... ways to bring people back in a time when demand may be softening,\u201d said Doyle, founder of MickeyVisit.com, a parks affordability guide.\n\nHandicapping ESPN\u2019s flagship streamer\n\nLive sports is a key attraction for consumers, and Disney has frequently mentioned its plans to launch its standalone ESPN flagship streaming product this summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut analysts and investors would like more information about pricing, the look of the product, how its experience will be different from the ESPN channel on linear television and how it will work with other services.\n\nWith Disney\u2019s continued transition from linear television to streaming, the company will need to make sure \u201cthat transition is smooth,\u201d said Yoon of Bernstein.\n\nThe company has already launched an ESPN tile on the Disney+ homepage to try to reduce churn and encourage new subscribers.\n\nCulture wars\n\nOne proposal on the company\u2019s proxy statement is an item from the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank that is calling on Disney to reconsider its participation in the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s corporate equality index.\n\nThe corporate equality index is an annual report that rates employers on their workplace inclusivity for LGBTQ+ workers.\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research, which often makes proposals at Disney\u2019s shareholder meeting, said Disney\u2019s participation in the index indicated that the company was involved in \u201cpartisan behavior\u201d and that it should rethink that decision due to \u201cfiduciary duty to its shareholders.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney recommended its shareholders vote no on the proposal.\n\nThe proposal hints at the type of culture wars that Disney has recently started to shrink from. The company recently acknowledged that it removed a trans athlete storyline from a Pixar animated series, saying \u201cmany parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.\u201d\n\nDisney has also softened some of its internal DEI policies, as have other Hollywood studios and businesses in other industries.",

She was in high school in New Jersey with no film credits to her name when Steven Spielberg cast her in 2021's \"West Side Story.\"\n\n\"I really am grateful for all of it, and this,\" she said of her starring role in \"Snow White.\" \"It's been four years since I was cast in it, and so, out of a seven year career, four years is the majority. I've learned so much along the way.\"\n\nTo reimagine the animated classic 88 years after its original release, director Marc Webb went straight to Walt Disney's vault and studied the animation cells.\n\n\"What an ambitious kind of endeavor it was for him,\" Webb said of Disney. \"It blew people away. He invented the mold. It was an amazing legacy of storytelling that he created in 1937. I went back and studied. We went deep into the archives and looked at what they were working on.\"\n\nWebb was able to bring back back scenes that originally never made it into the animated classic. His goal was to honor the nostalgia, while adding to the legacy with new music and a princess now ready to lead and inspire the next generation of Disney fans.\n\n\"This is for them,\" Zegler said. \"Every day I walked onto set and our director is a dad making a movie for his kid and we are now giving it to kids all around the world. It is for them.\"\n\nThe live action Disney film, \"Snow White,\" is in theaters on March 21.\n\nDisney is the parent company of this station.",

            "content": "With all the turmoil besetting the real world, you\u2019d think there might be more important things to inflate into controversies than the pre-release kerfuffles that have plagued \u201cSnow White.\u201d As it turns out, this is one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature. And I say that as someone who mostly doesn\u2019t like them. Yes, I\u2019ve enjoyed a couple (\u201cCinderella,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King\u201d). At heart, though, I still don\u2019t truly get the idea of Disney strip-mining its animated IP \u2014 and doing so not because there\u2019s anything inherently appealing about turning painterly fairy-tale cartoons into stilted, less sublime real-life versions of themselves. What the remakes are selling is the theme-park novelty of the transformation: Look, here\u2019s what an animated classic looks like when it\u2019s retrofitted with sets and actors!\n\nAll that said, the chirpy, vivacious, just-romantic-enough-to-get-by \u201cSnow White\u201d proves to be an exception to the rule. Directed by Marc Webb (\u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man,\u201d \u201c500 Days of Summer\u201d), from a script by Erin Cressida Wilson (\u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d), the film is lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cDumbo\u201d or \u201cMulan.\u201d Rachel Zegler, as Snow White, has a pertly appealing glow, and Gal Gadot, as the Evil Queen, glares divinely in her darkly purplish cloaked finery (stained-glass crown, nails like daggers, matching black lips and eyes), like the world\u2019s most furious dominatrix. I wish Gadot\u2019s vocal performance were more operatic and less Mata Hari, but she still makes a stylishly intense villain.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBut let\u2019s talk about the controversies, which in a rare moment of ideological combustibility come from both sides of the cultural-politics spectrum. Is the casting of Rachel Zegler, an actor of Latin heritage, as Snow White, a character originally named for her complexion, some sort of problem? Just to pose that question is to float a thought at once racist and absurd. So \u2014 short answer \u2014 no. (In the new movie, our heroine is named for the snowstorm that took place the night she was born.)\n\nAnd what of the fact that Snow White, abandoned in the woods (where the Huntsman is too kindhearted to carry out the Evil Queen\u2019s order to murder her), comes upon a cottage where seven cute, quarrelsome 249-year-old short men with Amish beards live in bachelor squalor and become her protectors? The main objection to this has been raised by Peter Dinklage, the actor and proud spokesman for little people who has assailed the \u201cseven dwarfs\u201d concept as cringingly stereotypical and retrograde. I can sort of see what he means, though carried to its logical conclusion that POV would render \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d a crime against humanity. In the new \u201cSnow White,\u201d the word \u201cdwarf\u201d is never mentioned, and the CGI versions of the tale\u2019s little people honestly struck me as no more offensive (or reality-based) than hobbits.\n\nAh, but what of Zegler\u2019s dismissal of the 1937 \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\u201d which was Walt Disney\u2019s first animated feature \u2014 and, in my opinion, still the most poetic and ravishing of them all? Speaking to Variety, Zegler said that in the original film \u201cthere\u2019s a big focus on her love story with the guy who literally stalks her. Weird, weird.\u201d She made it sound like the new \u201cSnow White\u201d might toss away the romance right along with the gorgeous fairy-tale matte work. What is \u201cSnow White,\u201d after all, if not a love story?\n\nActually, the love story remains quite intact. The fabled prince is gone, replaced by a noble ruffian, Jonathan (Andrew Burnap), who Snow White first encounters when he\u2019s trying to steal potatoes out of the castle scullery. Their flirtation is very contempo Disney \u2014 it reminded me of the romance in \u201cFrozen,\u201d where love tussles with the lure of empowerment. I will say that it\u2019s telling that in a film that exuberantly revives most of the key songs from the original \u201cSnow White\u201d (\u201cHeigh-Ho,\u201d \u201cWhistle While You Work\u201d), the filmmakers have given the heave-ho to \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come.\u201d This makes literal sense, since the prince is no longer a character. But what a song to lose! There\u2019s a haunting magic to it, and that layer of magic isn\u2019t there in the new \u201cSnow White.\u201d\n\nYet our heroine\u2019s emotional journey remains vibrant, as does the story\u2019s enchantingly wide-eyed and sinister design: the Evil Queen\u2019s relationship with her Magic Mirror (the face of her malignant narcissism); and the way Snow White, after her mother, the Good Queen (Lorena Andrea), dies and her father, the Good King (Hadley Fraser), is sent away to war (he never returns), becomes a servant like Cinderella, only to learn who she is in the company of her seven jaunty woodland friends.\n\nWith catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces, these CGI gnomes bring the movie to life, whether it\u2019s the whimsically pedantic Doc (voiced by Jeremy Swift), the philosophical Grumpy (Martin Klebba), or the incongruously youthful, mute, and big-eared Dopey (Andrew Barth Feldman), who suggests Tom Holland starring in a biopic of Mad magazine\u2019s Alfred E. Newman. There\u2019s also a handful of new songs, by Pasek and Paul, that from the witty \u201cPrincess Problems\u201d to the generically enraptured \u201cWaiting on a Wish\u201d hover somewhere between fine and forgettable.\n\nGadot\u2019s Evil Queen doesn\u2019t just oppress Snow White. She\u2019s a fascist who brings a chill to the land, plundering its riches and trashing the humanity of the people. Does that make her the film\u2019s conscious metaphor for our current regime? You could say that we\u2019ve seen other fairy-tale rulers a lot like this one. Yet movies connect in mysterious ways. Who would have thought that a Disney live-action remake could seem this pointedly political? In the end, the most resonant romantic feeling \u201cSnow White\u201d leaves you with may be: Someday my chintz authoritarian will come tumbling down.",

Sadly, this is the case with the Mark Webb-directed and Erin Cressida Wilson-penned Disney\u2019s Snow White.\n\nSnow White was born in a carriage during a snowstorm, thus, her name Snow White. The King and Queen lead their country to prosperous times, and the King looks forward to eventually handing the kingdom to Snow White. Then the Queen dies. Eventually, the King remarries a beautiful woman with magical powers who is secretly evil and wants the kingdom\u2019s wealth to herself. After conspiring to have the King sent off to die in an \u201caccident,\u201d the now adult Snow White (Rachel Zegler) is left to observe the economic devastation of her kingdom.\n\nWhen the villagers are left to starve alone, Snow White shows compassion to her people, notably a thief named Jonathan (Andrew Byrnap). Her kindness makes her the fairest of them all. This news causes the Evil Queen (Gal Gadot) to plan Snow White\u2019s assassination, which leads her into the haunted forest and to the doorsteps of seven lonely and creepy dwarves. Can Snow White step up as the leader her father wanted her to be and defeat the Evil Queen through love, compassion, and empathy?\n\n\u201cCan Snow White step up as the leader her father wanted her to be and defeat the Evil Queen through love, compassion, and empathy?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m convinced that Disney\u2019s Snow White is an attempt to correct Walt Disney\u2019s 1937 version for modern audiences. First and foremost, this version has ample exposition, which Walt\u2019s version did not have. Everything about the kingdom and its lore needed explanation. A lot of this exposition is there to fill in supposed gaps in storytelling. Lots of exposition means lots of dialogue. Everyone has to tell their feelings or their plans. There were times when I said to myself, \u201cI got it. You don\u2019t need to say more.\u201d Don\u2019t get me started as the film tries to explain why Happy got the name Happy, Sleepy became Sleepy\u2026and so on. We didn\u2019t need this explanation\u2026even if it was for comedy\u2019s sake.\n\nI had the most hope for the songs written by composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who did incredible work with The Greatest Showman, La La Land, and Dear Evan Hansen. I love and adore all of those soundtracks. However, this is a mess. The music is excellent, but the lyrics are an issue. The opening number, \u201cGood Things Grow,\u201d is a song about prosperity and introduces us to the kingdom where good things grow. This is afar cry from the opening number of \u201cBelle\u201d in Beauty and the Beast, which sets the stage for who Belle is.\n\nI still don\u2019t understand Snow White\u2019s power ballad, \u201cWaiting on a Wish.\u201d It restates that she is trapped in the castle by the Queen and ultimately wants to be the daughter her father wants her to be. However, the lyrics and music are a far cry from \u201cLet It Go!\u201d The Queen\u2019s \u201cAll is Fair\u201d is essentially an \u201ceye for an eye\u201d song. \u201cPrincess Problems\u201d is the obligatory cute peasant versus princess song. The big love song, \u201cA Hand Meets a Hand,\u201d is a rushed attempt at becoming the next Disney classic. Here, you want to write a song that young lovers want sung at their weddings.",

            "content": "Honest Review \u2013 Disney\u2019s Snow White!\n\nLast night I saw an early screening of the new film, Disney\u2019s Snow White. Snow White has been surrounded by various controversies for a few different reasons, but I went in with an open mind. Snow White stars Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, as Snow White herself and the Evil Queen. I wasn\u2019t sure if Disney had stuck with the original story or if they changed it up, but now I know! I have thoughts on this new Snow White film, so I plan to tell you my honest opinion. Stop here if you don\u2019t want to read spoilers, there\u2019s no way to explain the movie without a more detailed explanation. Let\u2019s discuss!\n\nLike many of you, I have read and heard all of the controversy about Snow White. There was a lot, but I wanted to give it a fair shot. Within the first couple of minutes of the film, I quickly realized that this was not going to be like Walt\u2019s original version. Yes, that fast! We find out how Snow White got her name, and it had nothing to do with how the animated feature explained it. It\u2019s about a snow storm the night she was born. This was just the first of many changes throughout the movie.\n\nAs the story develops, more changes from the original are revealed. In this version of Snow White, Rachel Zegler plays a Princess who of course loses her parents, and is locked away by the Evil Queen, Gal Gadot. A thief from the outskirts of town, Jonathan, gets caught at the castle and Snow White sets him free. This character becomes her love interest rather than a prince, like its predecessor. The Evil Queen\u2019s magic mirror tells her that Snow White has become the fairest in the land, which doesn\u2019t sit well to say the least. She orders a huntsman to take her to the woods to and make sure she doesn\u2019t come back. He doesn\u2019t hurt her but rather lets her go. That\u2019s when she meets the dwarves with help from a group of adorable animals.\n\nAbout the dwarves\u2026 I was assuming I would not like them because of their CGI appearance rather than live action actors. They had such huge personalities, I enjoyed their scenes. Wait until you see what they did with Dopey, way off script! I don\u2019t want to give away all the ins and outs of the movie, no major details, so I\u2019ll proceed to summarize the rest.\n\nSnow White makes friends with the dwarves, ends up falling for Jonathan, the hag gives her a poison apple\u2026 mostly on par with the original. Jonathan kisses her to wake her up, the previews never told audiences that part. Snow White and her friends go back to the kingdom, she recruits the huntsmen to turn against the queen so she can take her rightful place as ruler. The Evil Queen dies but now how you think. The kingdom rejoices and it ends on a happy note. Here comes my honest opinions about this movie!\n\nAs an old school Disney fan, I originally didn\u2019t like the changes from the classic Snow White. I don\u2019t like change usually, so I wasn\u2019t surprised at my feelings. I guess the best way to think about this, is to NOT assume you\u2019re watching a retelling of the 1937 classic. Look at Snow White as a stand alone film. It\u2019s a familiar story but not the same as you remember. Speaking of stories, this film had parts that reminded me a little bit of a different one\u2026 Tangled. Jonathan is very much like Flynn Ryder, the criminal aspect and personality. Snow White, like Rapunzel, was basically held captive by an evil stepmother. Even the dancing in the kingdom seemed like a nod to Tangled. Just my opinion!\n\nYes, Jonathan does wake Snow White up from her death sleep, but in this story, she\u2019s the brave hero. In this version, Snow White isn\u2019t waiting for her prince to come, she met a man stealing potatoes from the castle. She ends up being the one who saves the day and restores happiness to her people. Again, not the Snow White from our childhood. It wasn\u2019t bad, just different. Rachel Zegler did a decent job as Snow White, her own version. There were glimpses of classic Disney here and there, endearing scenes like with those precious woodland creatures or dwarves. Gal Gadot, however, just didn\u2019t cut it as the Evil Queen. I tried to like her, I really did, but just couldn\u2019t. Pretty bad. Keep in mind these options have nothing to do with the actors personally, it\u2019s the characters. I left the theater with so many thoughts swirling around in my head, trying to take in what I just watched. Whew!\n\nAll in all, I thought Snow White was fine, just as a separate version from what Walt Disney originally released. Similar but different. I do love Tangled so there\u2019s that! The chatter outside the theater from others was that the movie was just ok. Not because of what people think of the actors themselves, it\u2019s the way the story was portrayed I believe. In the spirit of transparency, I can admit that I wasn\u2019t a Rachel Zegler fan (weird? weird) and never had seen a Gal Gadot movie. Afterwards, I thought Rachel\u2019s singing was beautiful, yet wished I still hadn\u2019t seen a Gal Gadot movie. The Evil Queen was the worst part, I was really rooting for a fun new villain too. If I was grading Snow White on a scale from one to ten, I\u2019d give it a 5.\n\nMy recommendation would be, if you\u2019re going to the theater to see Snow White, keep in mind that it\u2019s different. If you love the story of the original version, you MAY not care for this one. Maybe you\u2019d be better waiting for it to hit Disney+. I think if Disney did more press for the film and explained more of the story, perhaps people would be more interested in the movie. Unfortunately, comments from Rachel Zegler and others kind of made people get a preconceived notion and decided they weren\u2019t seeing the movie no matter what. It\u2019s not that bad, I was entertained. Is it outstanding? No, in my opinion, but you may disagree.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to share his thoughts about the massive stock market crash on Monday. The tumble saw the flagship S&P index lose $4 trillion from its February peak to end up lower since President Trump\u2019s election win. Naturally, Cramer was full of thoughts about the President and how he might help markets. He started by outlining that the narrative surrounding tariffs could hurt President Trump, despite the fact that the US might very well need tariffs to balance the scales of global trade in its favor.\n\nCramer started out by sharing:\n\n\u201cBut, look let\u2019s just, we gotta come back to the President. You can\u2019t really watch the stock market when he said that tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we have ever done as a country. I call everyone\u2019s attention to the Washington Post piece this morning. Which says the base doesn\u2019t like tariffs. They\u2019re giving it thirty to thirty five percent people of the base who like tariffs. They have not been explained well.\u201d\n\nIn fact, despite the fact that the narrative surrounding tariffs has generated concerns about a recession, Cramer believes that the President is actually being too soft.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m looking at this and I\u2019m saying, and you know I support these tariffs, I\u2019m much harder on tariffs than he is,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think he [Trump] is being soft on tariffs. Because these, our partners, so-called partners have been ripping us up for ages. He\u2019s right about that,\u201d Cramer added.\n\nHowever, while the President might be right about tariffs, Cramer disagrees with him on the messaging. He believes that Trump\u2019s \u201cgotta be a little more like TR [Theodore Roosevelt]. You gotta speak softly and carry a big stick.\u201d On the flip side, the President\u2019s approach, which according to Cramer resembles \u201cspeak loud with no stick\u201d is \u201cwhat the bullies do.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC TV host also criticized Canada\u2019s approach in taking on Trump when it came to tariffs. \u201c[Y]ou don\u2019t want to do that. Now I wouldn\u2019t have done what Canada did, which is you know, fight back. You have to do it like Scheinbaum. But I just think that we\u2019re courting with a manufactured recession,\u201d he outlined.\n\nCramer cited former US Presidents and their approach to tariffs in his comments. President Trump repeatedly stated that he was a fan of President William McKinley, who held office from 1897 to 1901. However, Cramer believes that Trump should also consider Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s approach:",

Aside from an occasional pause to thank the audience or share a short anecdote, that\u2019s what happened over the next hour and 20 or so minutes.\n\nIsbell dedicated nearly half of his set to new material from his excellent, just-released solo album, \u201cFoxes in the Snow.\u201d Recorded in five days without Isbell\u2019s formidable backing band, the 400 Unit, \u201cFoxes in the Snow,\u201d like the set at Disney Hall, features just Isbell\u2019s voice, guitar and songs.\n\n\u201cI wound up recording a record in New York, and I wanted to walk into a studio in the Village with a single guitar and a notebook and come out of there with an album, like people used to do in the \u201960s,\u201d he told NPR about the album.\n\nSinger-songwriter Jason Isbell delivered a powerful solo show, which included a number of new songs from \u201cFoxes in the Snow,\u201d at Walt Disney Concert Hall on March 14, 2025.

(Photo credit Farah Sosa / Courtesy of the LA Phil) Expand\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: That is more than enough. Isbell\u2019s guitar playing and voice were both in great form, and the songs, all 18 of them (including a cover of Bon Iver\u2019s \u201cBeth/Rest\u201d), sounded fantastic. Typically, a simple voice and guitar approach is described as \u201cspare\u201d or \u201cstripped-down,\u201d but Isbell creates a rich, melodic sound bursting with emotions despite the limited instrumentation.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re being this open and this vulnerable, there\u2019s something about doing it alone,\u201d Isbell said in a recent SPIN magazine interview about the album. \u201cEven though you know that the results are going to get broadcast to everybody, there\u2019s something about sitting with a guitar and singing a song that makes sense to me when it\u2019s this personal.\u201d\n\nIf there was an elephant in the room \u2013 if not the song \u201cElephant,\u201d as he didn\u2019t play that stone-cold classic off \u201cSoutheastern\u201d \u2013 it was the personal part: Isbell filed for divorce in 2023 from his wife and former bandmate Amanda Shires; some of the new material addresses the breakup (and, according to published reports, a new relationship with artist Anna Weyant who designed the new album cover).\n\nBeyond the music itself, Isbell seemed to address his recent history in an oblique way, if at all. While introducing \u201cDanko/Manuel,\u201d an early song from his time in the band Drive-By Truckers, Isbell explained that as a young songwriter of 22 or 23, he\u2019d felt he hadn\u2019t experienced enough on his own to write about.\n\n\u201cTurns out, that\u2019s not a problem now,\u201d he said with a slightly pained smile.\n\nThen it was back to the songs and his performance, because you didn\u2019t need to know anything about his personal life to understand he delivered a powerhouse set of beautiful, often devastating songs rich with indelible images and heartbreaking melodies.\n\nThe performance began with \u201cBury Me,\u201d which opens the new album with Isbell\u2019s soaring voice and stands among his strongest work, followed by \u201cMiddle of the Morning,\u201d off his 2023 album \u201cWeathervanes.\u201d\n\nNext came the melancholic \u201cOnly Children,\u201d a song from 2020\u2019s \u201cReunions\u201d and Isbell offered up a story about that one. A friend\u2019s child, said the singer, had mistaken the lyric, \u201cHydrocodone in your backpack,\u201d and thought Isbell was singing, \u201cHide a corn dog in your backpack.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you mishear a lyric, don\u2019t tell the person who wrote the song,\u201d said Isbell, who joked that nowadays he had to think very carefully about singing the correct words because of the child\u2019s snack-based narrative. \u201cIt makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nNext came \u201cGravelweed,\u201d one of the new album\u2019s most affecting songs, which includes the line, \u201cI\u2019m sorry the love songs all mean different things today,\u201d and the title song, \u201cFoxes in the Snow,\u201d another deeply personal sounding song on par with his best material.\n\nTwo songs about his home state, longtime favorite \u201cAlabama Pines\u201d and an affecting new song, \u201cCrimson and Clay,\u201d followed, The latter begins with what sound like pleasant childhood memories before landing on images of a noose and rebel flags.\n\n\u201cThis started out as a love song to my hometown,\u201d said Isbell, adding that good love songs also contain the truth.\n\nNext came \u201cTraveling Alone,\u201d which prompted a story about feeling that a section of the song had unintentionally \u201cripped off\u201d John Prine, so he confessed to his songwriting hero. He recalls Prine saying that he didn\u2019t think Isbell had stolen from him \u2013 on that song \u2013 with the unstated implication that perhaps the younger musician had on some other songs.\n\n\u201cI loved him so much,\u201d said Isbell, laughing.\n\nAfter the previously mentioned \u201cDanko / Manuel,\u201d Isbell did two more strong new pieces, \u201cGood While It Lasted\u201d and \u201cEileen,\u201d and then commented briefly that things were \u201ca little bit tough\u201d these days for many.\n\n\u201cI thought for a long time I knew this country better than I did,\u201d he said, going on to praise the people he met on tour and at his gigs.\n\nThen it was time for two songs off his 2017 album, \u201cThe Nashville Sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are my spooky monster songs,\u201d said Isbell, about \u201cChaos and Clothes\u201d and \u201cIf We Were Vampires.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not really about monsters; they\u2019re about some crazy [stuff.]\u201d\n\nIsbell finished the set with fan-favorites \u201cCast Iron Skillet\u201d and \u201cIf It Takes a Lifetime.\u201d He returned for an encore consisting of a new song, \u201cRide to Robert\u2019s,\u201d followed by the Bon Iver cover and ended with the searing breakup song, \u201cTrue Believer,\u201d that, while not a rousing singalong, deftly summed up the themes of the night.\n\nMaybe the strongest indicator of the quality of his new material and Isbell\u2019s gifts as a performer is that he didn\u2019t play some of his best-loved tunes and the night didn\u2019t suffer a bit for it (though it\u2019s doubtful anyone in the Walt Disney Concert Hall would have complained if he\u2019d played longer).\n\nInstead, Isbell just added more keepers to his setlist, and fans can now look forward to hearing how he plays them with a full band.\n\nBecause he says he will be back with his band. Isbell said he loved playing with his group and joked that he missed his friends \u201csilently judging\u201d him on stage.",

            "content": "When Rachel Zegler stepped onto the red carpet at the world premiere of Disney\u2019s \u201cSnow White\u201d on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood, the newest Disney princess was greeted by a smaller-than-usual assembly of photographers to capture her light pink ballgown and dazzling diamonds.\n\nZegler\u2019s co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the Evil Queen, soon followed, also smiling dutifully for the cameras assembled in the center of the tented venue outside the El Capitan Theatre that hosted the pre-party celebration ahead of the 3:30 p.m. screening.\n\nInstead of the usual lineup of dozens of red carpet reporters, the only interviewers they encountered were employed by Disney, like Jodi Benson, who voiced Ariel in the studio\u2019s 1989 animated classic \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d Such was the \u201cscaled-back\u201d premiere of \u201cSnow White,\u201d which hits theaters on March 21.\n\nCast members Martin Klebba, Jason Kravits, George Salazar, Andy Grotelueschen, Emilia Faucher, Lorena Andrea, Dujonna Gift, and Idris Kargbo, as well as director Marc Webb, screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson, producers Marc Platt and Jared LeBoff, songwriters Justin Paul and Benj Pasek, composer Jeff Morrow and cinematographer Mandy Walker also walked the red carpet.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nScheduled for the hour and a half before the show began, the pre-party celebration was tucked away behind the El Capitan Theatre. It featured plenty of sponsored activities to keep youngsters (including children from the San Fernando and Malibu chapters of the Boys & Girls Club) occupied while they waited \u2014 including a magic mirror nail polish installation from Essie, Joffrey\u2019s Coffee & Tea serving a \u201cJust One Bite\u201d brew and a MiracleGro booth where guests could make a flower bouquet to bring home after the film. Allegra was also part of the co-branded campaign with dwarves Sneezy and Sleepy prominently featured. Guests also sipped on apple-infused drinks \u2014 appletinis, sparkling cider and Shirley Temples, a nod to the fact that the legendary kid star presented Walt Disney with an honorary Oscar for the original \u201cSnow White\u201d in 1938.\n\nJodi Benson interviews Rachel Zegler on the red carpet. Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney\n\nThe premiere event continues Zegler and Gadot\u2019s promotional tour for the movie. On March 2, the pair took the stage at the Dolby Theatre (just across Hollywood Blvd.) to present during the Oscars. Then, Zegler jetted off to promote the film internationally with Webb and perform the new single \u201cWaiting on a Wish\u201d \u2014 traveling first to Tokyo where she was joined on stage by Sakura Kiryu, who provides the Japanese dubbing voice of Snow White, then to Spain, where she performed the track with the Alc\u00e1zar of Segovia Castle as a backdrop. (The medieval castle inspired the one that appears in the 1937 animated film.) Gadot made the press round in NYC, including appearances on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,\u201d \u201cLive With Kelly and Mark\u201d and \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nBut the promo run hasn\u2019t been without conflict. In fact, \u201cSnow White\u201d has been plagued by controversy since its early development, beginning with the casting of Zegler as the titular princess in 2021. For some die-hard devotees, the actress\u2019s Colombian heritage disqualified her from playing the fantasy princess, described as having hair as black as ebony and skin as white as snow.\n\nThe social media outrage only got louder as time went on. In the summer of 2022, Zegler told red carpet interviewers that her version of the iconic princess wouldn\u2019t spend her days pining over a man. She called aspects of the original story \u201cweird\u201d and said that the 1937 film\u2019s prince \u201cliterally stalks\u201d Snow White, prompting fans to deem her unworthy of playing Snow White due to her \u201cdisdain.\u201d\n\nZegler addressed the torrent of online hate in her October Variety cover story, arguing that she\u2019d meant to convey that, while Snow White wants romance, she has other goals, too. \u201cI would never want to box someone in and say, \u2018If you want love, then you can\u2019t work.\u2019 Or \u2018If you want to work, then you can\u2019t have a family.\u2019 It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s never been true. It can be very upsetting when things get taken out of context or jokes don\u2019t land,\u201d she said. \u201cThe love story is very integral. A lot of people wrote that we weren\u2019t doing [that storyline] anymore \u2014 we were always doing that; it just wasn\u2019t what we were talking about on that day.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d alum Peter Dinklage also spoke out about the movie\u2019s portrayal of little people, critiquing the animated \u201cSnow White\u201d for perpetuating negative stereotypes and expressing concerns about the live-action adaptation. Following those remarks, Disney stated that \u201cto avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community.\u201d\n\nScroll for an inside look at the premiere:\n\nMarc E.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 16 Stocks? In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago during his show on March 18, 2024.\n\nOn the most recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised his viewers against exiting the market entirely, despite the sharp sell-off. He also reminded viewers that, historically, the market has always found its bottom, and stocks can rebound over time. Cramer then addressed the idea of selling everything but he raised an important question saying:\n\n\u201cSure you can get out, but can you get back in? Selling everything right now feels great. We know that President Trump is now hanging with the bears\u2026 As he himself said you can\u2019t really watch the stock market, the stock market\u2019s the problems of the rich, and they don\u2019t matter as long as it, they can take a hit. And that\u2019s a zeitgeist from the Walmart White House where Trump\u2019s giving us everyday lower prices for stocks.\u201d\n\nCramer then pointed out the disparity between President Trump\u2019s approach and what long-term investors might believe is the right course of action. In the past, Cramer noted, figures like Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell were seen as stabilizers, or \u201cputs,\u201d that would help cushion the market\u2019s downward moves. However, no one seems to be talking about that kind of support lately. He added:\n\n\u201cPeople are capitulating because they want to get rid of the pain and they don\u2019t want to lose the game\u2026 See, there\u2019s just one problem. How do you get back in?\u201d\n\nCramer also highlighted a common pitfall: many investors get scared off during market downturns and fail to seize the opportunity to buy strong companies at lower prices. He pointed out that this fear leads people to miss out on significant future gains, leaving them on the sidelines while others take advantage of lower stock prices and reap substantial rewards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why you should be thinking of buying the great companies here, not selling them. To not get good merchandise as it starts being really cheap is a failure of imagination, to not have held them all the way could be a failure of recognition.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 16 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on March 18, 2024. We then calculated their performance from March 18th, 2024, market close to March 7th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.",

Meanwhile, the CAA Foundation has launched the SoCal Fire Fund to provided support to those impacted. The fund is administered by the Entertainment Industry Foundation.\n\n\u201cAs this tragedy continues to unfold, The Walt Disney Company is committed to supporting our community and our employees as we all work together to recover and rebuild from this unbelievable devastation,\u201d said CEO Bob Iger in a statement. \u201cWalt Disney came to Los Angeles with little more than his limitless imagination, and it was here that he chose to make his home, pursue his dreams, and create extraordinary storytelling that means so much to so many people around the world. We are proud to provide assistance to this resilient and vibrant community in this moment of need.\u201d\n\nMore from Variety\n\nIn the statement announcing the $15 million commitment, the Disney corporation also expressed gratitude to firefighters and first responders continuing to work amid the ongoing emergency, as well as the company\u2019s own local reporters at KABC for their coverage.\n\n\u201cWe will be supporting vital organizations offering essential services on the ground, including the American Red Cross, the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, among others,\u201d reads the Disney release. \u201cAdditionally, we\u2019ve been working around the clock to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, many of whom have been impacted by these fires, and we intend to provide further resources to our Employee Relief Fund to help those facing hardship as a result of this crisis.\u201d\n\nParamount announced its donation in an internal memo distributed to employees from co-CEOs George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins. The statement also shares resources for impacted employees and a matching donation link to the company\u2019s employee assistance fund.\n\n\u201cWe also want to recognize and thank our dedicated CBS News and Stations journalists and teams on-the-ground in Los Angeles, especially our local KCBS/KCAL newsroom and our CBS News LA bureau,\u201d the Paramount statement reads. \u201cMany of them and their families have been personally affected by the fires, and they continue to show up to keep their local communities informed.\u201d\n\nThe SoCal Fire Fund, launched by CAA, Community Organized Relief Effort and the Los Angeles Unified School District Education Foundation, has initial funding by CAA leadership and is seeking additional partners to provide equitable recovery.\n\n\u201cThe scope of loss for neighbors across Los Angeles is immense and calls for a robust, compassionate, and flexible response\u2014one that prioritizes their immediate and long-term recovery needs,\u201d said Natalie Tran, CAA Foundation executive director. \u201cWe are grateful for the expertise of our long-standing partners for coming together to provide this unique and holistic approach. We invite all individuals, networks, and companies to join us as we face this still-unfolding crisis.\u201d\n\nParamount and Disney\u2019s contributions to relief efforts are the latest in what is expected to be an ongoing series of donations from the entertainment industry to support those impacted by the fires. The EIF announced Wednesday morning that the nonprofit activated a program to funnel public donations to frontline workers and displaced families and pets. The EIF last administered a fund for the 2023 Maui fires alongside Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne Johnson. Earlier in the week, Apple CEO Tim Cook shared that the tech giant will be donating to support victims and recovery efforts.\n\nOn Thursday, Jamie Lee Curtis shared on social media that she and her family had pledged $1 million to establish a fund to help those affected by the ongoing wildfires.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in communication with Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass and Senator Schiff as to where those funds need to be directed for the most impact,\u201d she wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild announced on Jan. 11 that they are putting $1 million toward its SAG-AFTRA Foundation to help members affected by the fires.\n\n\u201cI want to thank and recognize our broadcast journalist members who are out every day amid flames, smoke and fiery embers battling to bring this important news to the world,\u201d said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher. \u201cThe destruction caused by these blazes, the loss of life and homes, has been gut-wrenching to experience, and of course our hearts go out to all affected. But we knew we could do more; we hope this pledge helps relieve suffering and assists those impacted in putting their lives back together after this calamity. I have personally been affected by the fires and I feel deeply for others who are experiencing this tragedy. These are particularly stressful times. Stress compromises the immune system so we must be mindful of taking measures to support our health.\u201d\n\nOver 20,000 acres have burned in Pacific Palisades and Malibu since a fire started Tuesday morning. East of L.A., the Eaton Fire has burned through more than 13,000 acres in Altadena. A third blaze, the Hurst Fire, has burned through more than 700 acres in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe wildfires have prompted the entertainment industry to cancel or reschedule various events in the Los Angeles area, including the red carpet premieres of \u201cUnstoppable,\u201d \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d \u201cBetter Man\u201d and \u201cWolf Man.\u201d The Critics Choice Awards, originally scheduled for Jan. 12, was postponed to Jan. 26, while the Oscar nominations announcement has been pushed back two days (to Jan. 19) to accommodate an extended voting window.

Julie Tremaine\n\nWalt Disney\u2019s famous Los Angeles mansion is back on the market for the first time in years, offering deep-pocketed Disneyland lovers a chance to rent one of the most magical homes anywhere in California \u2014 or the world, for that matter.\n\n\n\nDisney\u2019s home at 4053 Woking Way, just below Griffith Park\u2019s towering forest of secret cedar trees, was quietly re-listed for rent this week. The house spans more than 6,300 square feet and features four bedrooms and five bathrooms, as well as a pool, but that\u2019s not why potential renters should consider scooping up the place. Inside, the home is a period-specific remake (mostly) of Disney\u2019s original vision when he built the place in 1932 with wife Lillian. That includes tall, beamed ceilings above a brick fireplace, a hand-painted dining room ceiling (complete with chandelier) and a theater room rumored to still have Disney\u2019s original screen, though the kitchen and other areas have been given a modern touch.\n\nTogether with their two daughters Diane and Sharon, the Disneys stayed in and very much loved the home for 18 years before departing in 1950.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nBig-time Mickey Mouse fans will know this era well, as it spans some of Disney\u2019s most crucial work including \"Cinderella,\" \"Bambi\" and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" The backyard also has a still-intact storybook mini-cottage for the kids, done up in LA\u2019s fantastical fairytale architecture style, and LA real estate influencer Tyler Neale says there may even be a few \"hidden Mickeys\" around, including one in Walt\u2019s office.\n\nThe view from the front courtyard. Julie Tremaine\n\nOver the years, the home has been used for private events and occasional public tours. This is also not the first time Russian film director and Disney fan Timur Bekmambetov has put the house up for rent. The place was previously listed back in 2023, drawing a ton of media interest, but was ultimately taken down in the fall of that year. Now, as of March 12 (per Redfin), it\u2019s back.\n\nSo how much to rent the Disney dream house? A cool $40,000 per month. That\u2019s a steep price anywhere, but it\u2019s hard to imagine a more one-of-a-kind home in Los Angeles \u2014 unless, of course, one has the means to purchase John Lautner\u2019s infamous cantilevered space ship home, the Chemosphere.",

            "content": "According to research by Ampere Analysis, by 2029, the global video streaming market is expected to generate $190 billion annually from 2 billion paid subscriptions. While Subscription Video-on-Demand (SVOD) remains dominant, Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV (FAST) and hybrid models are gaining traction. Additionally, sports streaming and interactive content, such as gaming and live events, are set to drive greater engagement.\n\nSeveral key factors continue to drive the industry's expansion, including rising internet penetration, increasing demand for mobile entertainment and AI-powered recommendation algorithms that enhance content discovery. Additionally, the widespread adoption of connected devices \u2014 from smart TVs to gaming consoles \u2014has further broadened access to streaming services.\n\nStreaming content refers to audio or video that can be played online without requiring a full download, ensuring minimal delays and a seamless user experience. This innovation has revolutionized media access, allowing users to instantly watch content across multiple devices. The ability to watch content anytime, anywhere, with minimal ads, has been a major driving force behind streaming's popularity. Streaming platforms are heavily investing in original and exclusive content, intensifying the battle for subscriber retention in what has become known as the \"content wars.\"\n\nWith broadband technology improving, smartphones becoming ubiquitous and viewer habits evolving, streaming content has now emerged as the dominant form of media consumption, and companies like Alphabet Inc. , Netflix, Inc. , The Walt Disney Co. and Roku, Inc. are gaining traction.\n\nOver the past two decades, the entertainment industry has undergone a seismic shift, moving from traditional cable television to on-demand digital streaming services. While streaming services were introduced to a wide audience with experimental broadcasts in the 1990s, the industry gained significant traction with YouTube's launch in 2005 and Netflix's introduction of its video-on-demand service in 2007.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 13, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc.

Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Screens and discover your next big opportunity.\n\nNetflix, the pioneer of streaming services, launched its on-demand streaming business in 2007. Driven by its extensive content library and strengthened global presence, this company has transformed from a small DVD rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider.\n\nNetflix has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. The company's endeavor to offer content catering to various genres has been a key catalyst in driving user engagement. The growing involvement of well-known Hollywood stars makes its movies and shows more attractive. NFLX sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNetflix is benefiting from its growing subscriber base due to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels. Its focus on streaming regional content has been leading to international growth. Netflix is diversifying its content portfolio and working on projects across India, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the entire Middle East. The company has launched low-priced mobile plans in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Moreover, the upcoming low-priced ad tier is expected to drive growth in these price-sensitive regions.\n\nNetflix's priorities for 2025 focus on strengthening its core business by expanding its library of series and films, enhancing product experience and accelerating the growth of its ad-supported model. Additionally, the company aims to develop newer initiatives, including live programming and gaming, to further engage its audience.\n\nRoku is the leading TV streaming platform provider in the United States, Canada and Mexico based on hours streamed. It began as a streaming device company in 2008 but has since transformed into a comprehensive streaming platform.\n\nThe company is witnessing solid growth in streaming households, attributed to the sale of stand-alone streaming devices, partnerships with TV brand partners like TCL, JVC, Sharp and other leading TV-makers who license the Roku OS to manufacture and sell Roku TV models, and licensing of Roku OS to certain service operators.\n\nMoreover, Roku is benefiting from growth in advertising driven by monetized video ad impressions on the increasing popularity of The Roku Channel. Factors contributing to this growth include the continued growing interest in streaming by traditional TV advertisers and ongoing investment in the company's OneView ad platform and overall ad tech capabilities. ROKU carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nRoku connects content publishers to users at scale and provides a deep array of promotion tools to help drive engagement and reach. It is benefiting from the availability of third-party streaming channels and continued investments in The Roku Channel. Increased user engagement on The Roku Channel and the popularity of the Roku TV program are helping Roku's growth.\n\nAlphabet's YouTube is the world's largest video-sharing platform, owned by Google, which is a subsidiary of Alphabet. Its subscription-based YouTube TV, launched in 2017, has emerged as a key competitor in the cord-cutting space. YouTube's dual-revenue model \u2014 ads and premium subscriptions \u2014 makes it one of the most financially robust streaming platforms.\n\nThe company is increasingly investing in creator-driven content, short-form videos via YouTube Shorts and exclusive sports streaming. YouTube's dominance in user-generated content and AI-driven content discovery provides an unmatched competitive advantage. Additionally, the rise of influencer marketing and direct creator monetization through YouTube's Partner Program enhances its revenue diversification.\n\nAlphabet's strategy of continuing investments in AI capabilities is driving continued growth and watch time across YouTube's ad-supported and premium experiences. Viewers globally streamed more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs in 2024. Investments in podcasts are also driving creators' and viewers' engagement. In 2024, people watched more than 400 million hours of podcasts each month on living room devices alone. Shorts are also gaining traction. In 2024, the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing increased more than 30%.\n\nAs more consumers shift toward digital-first video consumption, YouTube's growth trajectory remains strong, positioning it as a leading player in the future of streaming. GOOGL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nDisney entered the streaming market in 2019 with the launch of Disney+, quickly gaining millions of subscribers. Its primary streaming service offerings, Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu, with Disney+ focusing on Disney-owned content, ESPN+ on sports, and Hulu offering a mix of original programming and library content, are expected to be major growth drivers in the long run. The streaming segment's performance reflects Disney's successful pivot from pure subscriber growth to profitability.\n\nDisney+ has emerged as a key growth driver for Disney, primarily driven by its solid content portfolio. The service offers a huge collection of movies and episodes of television shows from brands such as Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic and Disney+ originals.\n\nDisney has an impressive line-up of big-budget movies slated to be released over the next couple of years, a number of which will appear on Disney+ simultaneously with their theatrical releases. The rapidly growing subscriber base should strengthen Disney's position in the streaming space. DIS currently has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nDisney's strategic moves, including the addition of an ESPN tile on Disney+ and various platform enhancements, demonstrate its commitment to improving user experience and content accessibility amid intensifying competition. Its focus on sports streaming, particularly Live Sports, is expected to drive growth in the long haul.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

            "content": "I spend a lot of my year walking Disney World\u2019s theme parks and hotels, and I gotta admit, the way I\u2019ve been going about it is about to change DRASTICALLY!\n\nVisiting Disney World every day might seem like a dream, and most days, you\u2019d be very right to assume so. There\u2019s a lot that we get to see and do every day that most people only dream of getting the chance to do even once in their lifetime. However, since we visit so often we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the uglier side of Disney World. And the parks can get especially chaotic with construction.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been keeping up with the latest announcements Disney has released over the last year, you\u2019ll know there are TONS of changes on the horizon. Some we\u2019ve already seen evidence of in the parks, and others were still learning about as Disney teases more updates about its upcoming projects and lands.\n\nWhile growth is not necessarily a bad thing, the growing pains aren\u2019t always pretty. Most recently we saw this in EPCOT over a multi-year revamp of Future World which we now know today as World Celebration. Change takes time, patience, and lots of weird mapping of construction walls in the parks. So with all this talk of major change coming to Magic Kingdom soon, it\u2019s not hard to see why there\u2019s going to be areas of this park I avoid at all costs.\n\nWe\u2019ve already gotten a taste of what\u2019s to come in Frontierland with Disney World closing down the former Frontierland Shootin\u2019 Arcade and revamping its space into McKim\u2019s Mile House DVC Lounge. When construction on a small scale happens, it can be a nuisance, but not totally trip-ruining.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s planned for Frontierland and more specifically Tom Sawyer Island looks like it will need construction levels on a massive scale. Uprooting almost an entire land will be quite the undertaking construction-wise, and there\u2019s likely to be LOTS more construction walls surrounding most of the area for a lengthier amount of time.\n\nThis construction will usher in the closing of Tom Sawyer Island to transform it into Cars Land where we\u2019re expecting two new rides to fill the area. One of which we just learned will be modeled after an exploration trip Imagineers took in the dessert to mimic the movements and terrain they experienced off-roading in vehicles (of course with a Pixar touch of character)!\n\nThere\u2019s also the construction that\u2019s expected to be around for awhile at Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. We knew this construction and refurbishment was unavoidable but it\u2019s expected to be closed for quite some time (in the upwards of around a year).\n\nAdditionally, Magic Kingdom also has plans to build out a Villains Land within the park which may lie just beyond Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. So far, Disney has only teased some concept art of what they envision this new land to look like, but from what they\u2019ve shared, it\u2019s pretty ambitious!\n\nHere\u2019s where my concern lies. The way I visit Magic Kingdom once this bigger construction starts to take form, will only make me want to avoid this area and possibly Frontierland all together. Getting to the only few things that will still be left open on the back end of Frontierland could become more of a hassle than what it\u2019s worth. Aside from Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure ride, a few shops and Pecos Bill, and a stop to board the Walt Disney World railroad at the Frontierland train station, there won\u2019t be much to look at or venture out for. I could also see the potential to not want to disembark the railroad at the Frontierland train station since it can be boarded at several other points around the park.\n\nIn short, unless I\u2019m really searching for some unique merchandise or taking a plunge down the mountainside on Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure, I\u2019m not seeing much cause to make me want to visit an entire land inside Magic Kingdom for a while. Since this is a land that connects my usual walk around the park, I\u2019ll be more apt to be taking the shortcuts from Adventureland into Liberty Square than the (what was formerly the scenic route) through Frontierland along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re always talking about the latest news, changes, and more around Disney World! Stay tuned with us at AllEars so you don\u2019t miss a thing.\n\n\ufeff\n\nComments (2)",

            "content": "Disney is finally bringing its beloved Cars franchise to the Magic Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida. As part of a massive expansion to Frontierland, the company announced a Cars land with two new attractions on the former site of Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island. Disney recently released more details on its upcoming Cars expansion\u2014and it looks pretty promising.\n\nThe main attraction will be a high-speed, rally-style course meant to simulate \"racing over rocky terrain, ascending to mountain peaks, and dodging around geysers,\" the company says. The second, yet-to-be-announced attraction will be geared toward smaller children and families.\n\nPhoto by: Disney Photo by: Disney\n\n\"Our primary goal is creating an emotional experience for our guests,\" said Imagineer Michael Hundgen during a presentation at SXSW in Austin, Texas. \"For this Cars attraction, we need to invent a new type of ride vehicle. No one builds these in a factory because it has to do so much more than just carrying you from one place to another. We have to create a car that conveys a feeling when you ride in it.\"\n\nTo get a better idea of how everything will look and feel, Disney built a dedicated dirt track in Florida to simulate things like elevation changes, rocky bypasses, and high-speed off-roading. The company released a video showing Imagineers and executives traversing said course in Polaris RZRs.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, the final ride vehicles won\u2019t look like these run-of-the-mill off-roaders.\n\n\"We\u2019re using a customized production vehicle,\" Hundgen confirmed. \"It has sensors all over it, and we\u2019re taking it for test drives on our dirt track to gather data on how the vehicle responds to different terrain. This is where we turn that feeling we want into real-world engineering.\"\n\nPhoto by: Disney\n\nDisney and Pixar will create custom vehicles based on characters from the Cars franchise, including favorites like Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater. Plus, there will be a few other new characters we haven\u2019t seen yet, complete with rugged off-road elements, special names, and even racing numbers\u2014\"Just like a real race,\" Hunden says.\n\nDisney has already started construction of the new Cars attractions at its Magic Kingdom park, but the company says the new Cars land in Orlando likely won\u2019t be ready until 2028. But, it seems like it could be worth the wait.\n\n7 Disney\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up\n\nand For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use\n\nSource: Disney Parks Blog\n\nShare this Story Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFlipboard\n\nReddit\n\nWhatsApp\n\nE-Mail",

Roblox Corporation is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn). It bleeds into the real world in all sorts of ways, such as when the BBC used it last year to explain the UK's general election to children.\n\nNevertheless the platform remains dogged by accusations it doesn't do enough to protect young users in particular. The horrifying case of a paedophile who abducted a 15 year-old girl after meeting her on Roblox is one of many, with data reported by Bloomberg showing US police have arrested two dozen people since 2018 \"accused of abducting or abusing victims\" they'd met on Roblox.\n\nThen there are the accusations it exploits young users and has effectively built an empire on the back of child labour (which Roblox denies). Turkey has just straight-up banned Roblox for \"child exploitation.\"\n\n(Image credit: Roblox Corporation)\n\nFor its part Roblox always emphasises the number of people who have \"amazing experiences\" on the platform, and highlights the many tools and parental controls it offers.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" says Baszucki. \"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"\n\n(Image credit: Roblox Corporation)\n\nLast year the company did announce new rules for under-13s following a scathing child safety report, and has AI systems that monitor communications. \"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" says Baszucki.\n\nFor my part, I raise my kids on a diet of Nintendo, dad-authorised PC games, and Minecraft without the online features. I would say I'm fairly liberal generally about their exposure to various media but there are lines, and one of them for sure is Roblox. I don't want my kids on it.\n\nThings get slightly off-piste later in the interview, as Baszucki compares the experience of building Roblox to how Walt Disney must have felt when building Disney into what it is. \"[The job is] a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom.\"\n\nIf that isn't grandiose enough for you, Baszucki is asked to describe Roblox in three words and goes for four: \"The future of communication.\"",

            "content": "Almost from the beginning, Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cSnow White\u201d live-action remake became a political lightning rod.\n\nFirst, it was the racist backlash to the casting of actor Rachel Zegler, who is of Colombian descent on her mother\u2019s side, as the titular character who canonically had \u201cskin as white as snow.\u201d\n\nThen, die-hard fans got up in arms about Zegler\u2019s comments that the story would be updated for modern times, putting less emphasis on Snow White\u2019s dreams of Prince Charming. The royal love interest \u201cliterally stalks\u201d the princess in the original 1937 animated film, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong the way, the film has also battled questions about its depiction of little people and its leading actors\u2019 viewpoints on the Israel-Hamas war. Zegler has been an outspoken advocate for Palestinians, while Gal Gadot, who plays the evil queen, has voiced support for Israel, where she was born and served the mandatory two years in the Israeli army.\n\nAll of these issues are colliding ahead of the film\u2019s theatrical opening next week, a high-stakes debut for Burbank-based Disney. The movie, which reportedly cost $250 million to make before marketing expenses, is the latest in the company\u2019s mostly successful strategy of rebooting animated classics.\n\nIn the Disney vault, \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\u201d Walt Disney\u2019s first full-length animated feature film, is considered among the fairest of them all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now it becomes the latest Disney redo to go through the culture war buzzsaw. Previously, actor Halle Bailey, who is Black and starred in the 2023 \u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d remake, faced racist backlash after being cast as Ariel, who was white in the 1989 animated film.\n\nThe company has frequently been a tinderbox: for diverse casting in its \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise and for its opposition to anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in Florida, which led to a prolonged battle with Gov. Ron DeSantis. Disney has also been on the receiving end of intense conservative criticism over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\n\u201cDisney is now the most storied brand in America; if you are that, you have a target on your forehead,\u201d said Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University\u2019s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. \u201cThis is not the little animation outfit Walt Disney created. When you\u2019re a mega-corporation ... every single issue you deal with is part of a globally interlinked, horribly complex map that you can\u2019t avoid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney will host a Hollywood premiere this weekend for the film at its El Capitan Theatre, though there will be no press line to interview actors along the red carpet. (Journalists will, however, be in attendance at the premiere.)\n\nDisney did not make executives available to comment.\n\nHow this myriad of issues will influence the box office performance of \u201cSnow White\u201d is an open question, analysts and industry experts said. If the movie is good enough, it could cut through the cultural noise. Critics\u2019 reviews have not been published yet.\n\n\u201cDo they actually have a terrific movie?\u201d Galloway said. \u201cIf they do, it will obliterate all the other concerns. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019ll feed the narrative.\u201d\n\nLive-action remakes of Disney\u2019s animated films have become a cornerstone of the studio\u2019s film strategy.\n\n\u201cSnow White\u201d is currently tracking for a $50-million opening weekend at the box office in the U.S. and Canada, according to people who have reviewed pre-release audience surveys.\n\nThat figure is below average compared with Disney\u2019s past live-action remakes, according to analysts. But that may be due to the older nature of the film\u2019s intellectual property, rather than the current controversies, said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at movie ticket seller Fandango and founder of tracking site Box Office Theory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany previous live-action remakes, such as 2019\u2019s \u201cLion King\u201d (which had a $191.8-million domestic opening), 2017\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d ($174.8 million), 2023\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d ($95.6 million) and 2019\u2019s \u201cAladdin\u201d ($91.5 million) were based on animated films released in the late 1980s and early \u201990s \u2014 part of the so-called Disney Renaissance period. Those efforts appealed to the nostalgia of millennials and Gen X moviegoers, many of whom now have children of their own, Robbins said.\n\nAnother success \u2014 2010\u2019s \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d which brought in $116 million in its opening weekend \u2014 had the benefit of being one of Disney\u2019s early live-action remakes.\n\nDespite Snow White\u2019s presence at Disney theme parks, the character and her story may be less recognizable to a younger audience, Robbins said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably going to play into the generational appeal that is usually a factor for other remakes on the Disney side,\u201d he said. Though, \u201cthere\u2019s no question that some of the other narratives that have developed around \u2018Snow White\u2019 over the last year or so aren\u2019t helping matters.\u201d\n\nBut even a poorer performance from \u201cSnow White\u201d won\u2019t halt Disney\u2019s live-action plans. The company is preparing to release a live-action version of \u201cLilo and Stitch\u201d in May, and has also announced a remake of the 2016 animated film \u201cMoana.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnow White\u201d has little competition right now in the family film market: Warner Bros. Pictures will release \u201cMinecraft,\u201d based on the gaming franchise, in April. Other options for children earlier this year included Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cDog Man\u201d and StudioCanal\u2019s \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d which was distributed by Sony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is something to be said that family movies have been holding up the box office recently in the last few months,\u201d Robbins said.",

The recent partnership with Bath & Body Works to launch the Disney Princess Fragrance Collection may have offered some market intrigue, but it was overshadowed by ongoing discussions involving Disney's indirect stake through Tata Play in the merger talks with Bharti Airtel. Meanwhile, investor sentiments might have been swayed by As You Sow's proposal for Disney to disclose risks associated with high-carbon investments. While the market overall experienced a 3.7% drop, leading tech stocks saw a rebound following an encouraging Consumer Price Index report. Despite broader economic trends such as potential tariff impacts and recession concerns, Disney's stock experienced a steeper weekly decline, possibly reflecting investors' cautious stance amidst these surrounding events.\n\nNYSE:DIS Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nThe past five years have seen Walt Disney's total shareholder return grow by 5.97%. This performance stands against various industry dynamics and market conditions. The company's participation in mergers and acquisitions played a significant role, notably its involvement in the merger between Tata Play and Bharti Airtel, reshaping its strategic investments in the Indian market. Furthermore, ongoing earnings growth, with profits soaring by 19.2% annually, bolstered its financial foundation despite challenging market conditions.\n\nThe introduction of share buybacks totaling US$3.80 billion underlines Disney's commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Concurrently, substantial executive changes, such as new leadership appointments, aimed to strengthen its operational capabilities. Despite a strong yearly profit growth that surpassed industry peers, Disney's 1-year return trailed behind both the US market and the broader entertainment industry. A dividend increase in December 2024, moving from US$0.75 to US$1.00 per share, also underscores the company's efforts to provide consistent returns to its investors.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The sequel, which was co-directed by Jason Hand and David Derrick Jr., is debuting on Disney+ this week after earning more than $1 billion at the global box office. Miller didn\u2019t initially plan on being part of that journey, at least not with cinemas as the first port of call. She was initially hired as a consulting writer when \u201cMoana 2\u201d was still conceived as a multi-episode streaming series instead of an 100-minute feature film. The success of the first film among Disney+ subscribers made the company rethink its plans for the franchise, resulting in a last-minute scramble to retrofit the story.\n\n\u201cThere was quite a lot of streamlining that needed to happen,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWe needed to right-size the story. In the series, we spent quite a lot of time with the crew of her ship. But Moana\u2019s name is in the title, so the film had to reflect that. We made sure the film used the crew members to show her becoming a better leader.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMiller, who is Samoan, felt an intense connection to the heroine of \u201cMoana,\u201d the strong-willed daughter of a Polynesian chief, when she saw the 2016 original film.\n\n\u201cI wept,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI had never walked into a Regal Cinema and heard the voices of my people before. And to have one of them be a Disney princess changes everything. It says, \u2018It\u2019s OK to be Polynesian and be strong and adventurous and funny.\u2019 You see yourself reflected on screen and that\u2019s powerful.\u201d\n\nMiller grew up in Long Beach, Calif., but Hollywood felt impossibly far away. She applied to film schools, but didn\u2019t get into one of the better known programs. Instead, she attended the University of Hawaii, where the entertainment industry unexpectedly arrived on her front door. She was able to get an internship on the set of \u201cLost,\u201d the mind-bending ABC thriller series that was shooting in the state.\n\n\u201cThere were all these other Pacific Islanders working around me,\u201d she remembers. \u201cAnd it gave me an appreciation for all the different skills you need to tell a story and what a crew does to pull it off. Being on a set like that was an incredible crash course.\u201d\n\nShe would go on to work on the Netflix shows \u201cNarcos\u201d and \u201cThai Cave Rescue\u201d before getting the call from Disney to explore the world of Motunui. Now that she\u2019s made it in the entertainment business, Miller is trying to build a ladder for other underrepresented talent to join her there. She\u2019s co-founded an organization called Pasifika Entertainment Advancement Komiti (PEAK), which offers networking and professional development assistance to members of the community.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to see ourselves on the images on screen, we need to have a role in telling these stories,\u201d Miller says. \u201cAnd storytelling is a big part of our community, so I want to protect that and to keep exploring what it means to be a Pacific Islander.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also not done with charting the course for the plucky adventurer at the heart of the \u201cMoana\u201d franchise. Miller has teamed up with Jared Bush to write the screenplay for the live-action version of \u201cMoana.\u201d Thomas Kail, one of the creative forces behind \u201cHamilton,\u201d directs with Dwayne Johnson portraying Maui, the mythological character he voiced in the animated films. Newcomer Catherine Laga\u02bbaia will play Moana. \u201cShe\u2019s incredible,\u201d Miller raves. \u201cShe had no problem going head-to-head with Dwayne. She wasn\u2019t intimidated at all.\u201d\n\nMiller says the live-action movie will honor the legacy of the animated original, but she thinks that seeing actors brave the elements will make the new version even more impactful.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a 16-year-old girl who is on the open water embarking on a dangerous journey,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThe visceral nature of that really comes through with live action. It gives the movie a real human vulnerability that will make it feel fresh.\u201d",

He preceded Mickey Mouse, whom Universal replaced Oswald with in 1928.\n\nWhen Disney CEO Bob Iger came on board, he wanted to restore Oswald back to the brand. Disney acquired the Oswald trademark from NBCUniversal in 2006, and it became public domain in 2023.\n\nFavreau directed 2016\u2019s THE JUNGLE BOOK, which won a Movieguide\u00ae Teddy Bear Award\u00ae and was voted one of the Best Movies for Families. Favreau also created, wrote and executive produced THE MANDALORIAN. He executive produced THE BOOK OF BOBA FETT, AHSOKA and STAR WARS: SKELETON CREW. He\u2019s also directing and producing THE MANDALORIAN AND GROGU, a feature film set to come out May of next year.\n\nRELATED: MUFASA: THE LION KING SCORES ANOTHER WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE MILESTONE\n\nA 1927 Film Daily advertisement gives an idea of what Oswald\u2019s personality is like: \u201cI\u2019m krazier than a krazy kat, dippier than a dippy dog, laden with LUCK, gold, gelt, simoleons, for the guy who grabs me now for I\u2019M THE CARTOON SENSATION OF THE YEAR!\u201d the rabbit boasts.\n\nIn 2013, Oswald appeared in the short GET A HORSE! He also cameoed in another short in 2023, ONCE UPON A STUDIO. And as part of Disney\u2019s 100th anniversary celebration, the character got his own short in 2022, called OSWALD THE LUCKY RABBIT, per Animation Magazine. He also appears in MICKEY MOUSE and THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MICKEY MOUSE series and a handful of Disney video games.\n\n\u201cOn the eve of Disney\u2019s 100th anniversary, it was such a joy to create the first new Oswald short from our studio since 1928,\u201d said Emmy-winning producer Dorothy McKim in 2022. \u201cOur hand-drawn animation team \u2013 including our hand-drawn legends Mark Henn, Randy Haycock and Eric Goldberg, as well our wonderful team of 2D apprentices, had a ball animating in the style of Oswald\u2019s era.\u201d\n\n\u201cOswald is such a plucky scamp. We wanted to bring Oswald back, and in the short, he literally returns to his original home, the movie screen,\u201d added POCAHONTAS animator Eric Goldberg. \u201cWe wanted to have Oswald do all of the \u2018squash-and-stretch,\u2019 \u2018rubber hose\u2019-animation style, celebrating that first generation of Walt Disney\u2019s artists.\u201d\n\nIn the new show, though, it won\u2019t all be the classic \u201csquash-and-stretch\u201d style, as it\u2019s expected to have a live-action/animation mix.\n\nREAD NEXT: THE MANDALORIAN & GROGU MOVIE ADDS TWO NEW CAST MEMBERS\n\nWatch HIS GIRL FRIDAY \u2192",

            "content": "On the heels of the successful launch of a new daily sports show, SC+, exclusively on Disney+, we spoke with hosts Gary Striewski and Randy Scott about all the hype, their day jobs and making a daily show that resonates with every kind of sports fan. \u201cIt\u2019s fast, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s everything you love about SportsCenter \u2014 but built for streaming,\u201d Scott said.\n\nSC+ just launched exclusively on Disney+ last week. How\u2019s it going?\n\nSCOTT: We love it! The energy on the set is incredible and the feedback we\u2019re hearing from fans has been great. It\u2019s still early days but we\u2019re having fun with it.\n\nThe show is the latest extension of the iconic, multiplatform SportsCenter brand that\u2019s been on ESPN since the network launched in 1979. How is this a natural evolution of the brand and why Disney+?\n\nSTRIEWSKI: For over 40 years, SportsCenter has been the go-to destination for sports fans, delivering highlights, analysis, and breaking news across multiple platforms. We wanted to take that brand halo and create a daily touchpoint for sports on Disney+. Who doesn\u2019t want their daily sports news in a fast-paced, streamlined format that they can watch wherever and whenever they want?\n\n9 a.m. ET live? Absolutely.\n\n11:45 a.m. during someone\u2019s lunch break? No problem. (But don\u2019t tell the bosses.)\n\n7:26 p.m. before calling it a night? For sure.\n\nYou both already anchor the 7 a.m. ET SportsCenter on ESPN. In what ways is SC+ tailored for a streaming audience?\n\nSCOTT: We constantly hear from fans how much they love the \u201cTop 10\u201d on SportsCenter, so SC+ is built around the most buzzworthy and engaging sports moments right from the start. Unlike our traditional SportsCenter show, SC+ is built for the casual sports fan and everything in between \u2014 the show is more direct, dynamic, and digestible.\n\nThe show streams live 7 days a week on Disney+ and ranges from 15 to 30 minutes. It\u2019s important to us that fans get everything they need quickly, while still having the ability to watch on demand when it works for them.\n\nBut\u2026 if you like interruptions, this is not the show for you \u2014 because there aren\u2019t any. It\u2019s the opposite of a close game with two minutes left in the fourth quarter and both teams holding all their timeouts. The time flies on this show. If it were any more condensed, it would come in a can labeled \u201cmilk.\u201d Yet, at the same time, it\u2019s as thorough and comprehensive as only SportsCenter can be.\n\nHow does SC+ appeal to both diehard and casual sports fans?\n\nSTRIEWSKI: The beauty of SC+ is that it\u2019s built for every type of sports fan.\n\nFor diehards, it delivers must-see highlights, key plays, and breaking news in a fast, dynamic way \u2014 everything they need in just 30 minutes or less. For casual fans, it\u2019s an easy, daily way to stay informed \u2014 whether they watch live, catch up on demand, or just tune in for the biggest moments.\n\nAnd while the format is designed for a streaming audience, what hasn\u2019t changed is what makes SportsCenter special. There still isn\u2019t another show \u2014 not named SportsCenter \u2014 that curates the most important highlights and stories from across sports and delivers them in a perfectly digestible package the way ESPN does. That\u2019s what SC+ also does, just in a new way.\n\nAt the end of the day, we get the privilege of telling fans what\u2019s important in sports each day \u2014 and no one does that better.\n\nWhy is Disney+ the perfect platform for SC+?\n\nSCOTT: Not only is Disney+ one of the largest streaming platforms in the world, with a massive built-in audience, but those subscribers are already watching and engaging with ESPN content in the app so we knew there was an appetite for it. It also aligns with the way younger audiences consume content \u2014 on demand, quick-hit, and highly engaging.",

However, the red carpet will not include the dozens of media outlets usually invited by Disney to interview the cast and creatives at its premieres.\n\nInstead, coverage will be limited to photographers and a house crew.\n\nThe studio did not comment for this story, but the scaled back plans come amid controversies surrounding the Marc Webb-directed film, which hits theaters March 21.\n\nSome toxic Disney fans questioned Snow White being played by Zegler when her casting was announced because she is a Latina actor. The \u201cWest Side Story\u201d star also faced backlash when she called the 1937 original \u201cdated\u201d because the prince \u201cliterally stalks Snow White.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn an interview with Variety at D23 two years ago, Zegler said, \u201cShe\u2019s not going to be saved by the prince. She\u2019s not going to be dreaming about true love. She\u2019s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be.\u201d\n\nPeter Dinklage spoke out about the movie\u2019s portrayal of little people for perpetuating negative stereotypes. \u201cLiterally no offense to anything, but I was sort of taken aback,\u201d he said on the \u201cWTF With Mark Maron\u201d podcast in January 2024. \u201cThey were very proud to cast a Latino actress as Snow White, but you\u2019re still telling the story of \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u2019 Take a step back and look at what you\u2019re doing there.\u201d\n\nShortly following Dinklage\u2019s remarks, Disney said in a statement to \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d \u201cTo avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community.\u201d\n\nZegler reasons that the backlash to the film is due to the \u201cpassion\u201d for the original film. \u201cI interpret people\u2019s sentiments towards this film as passion,\u201d she said in an interview in the March issue of Vogue Mexico. \u201cWhat an honor to be a part of something that people feel so passionately about. We\u2019re not always going to agree with everyone who surrounds us and all we can do is our best.\u201d (Quotes were independently translated from Spanish to English by Variety).\n\nWorld politics have also come into play. Zegler has promoted \u201cfree Palestine\u201d on social media. At the same time, Gadot, who is Israeli, has become an outspoken supporter of Israel on social media as well as in a passionate speech she delivered on March 4 when she was honored at the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s annual summit in New York City. \u201cNever did I imagine that on the streets of the United States, and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating, justifying and cheering on a massacre of Jews,\u201d she said, in part.\n\nGadot has stayed away from politics in the past, but has said she felt she needed to speak up after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.\n\nIn February, several dozen pro-Palestine protesters gathered outside the Hollywood premiere of \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d and called for a boycott of the film over its inclusion of the Israeli superhero Ruth Bat-Seraph, aka Sabra, played by Israeli actress Shira Haas.\n\nMAGA supporters also blasted Zegler for her reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s reelection when she posted on Instagram, in part, \u201cMay Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace.\u201d She apologized for her remarks two days later.\n\nRachel Zegler, Gal Gadot at the 97th Oscars at the Dolby Theatre on March 2, 2025 in Hollywood.

As part of a massive expansion to Frontierland, the company announced a Cars land with two new attractions on the former site of Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island. Disney recently released more details on its upcoming Cars expansion\u2014and it looks pretty promising.\n\nThe main attraction will be a high-speed, rally-style course meant to simulate \"racing over rocky terrain, ascending to mountain peaks, and dodging around geysers,\" the company says. The second, yet-to-be-announced attraction will be geared toward smaller children and families.\n\nPhoto by: Disney Photo by: Disney\n\n\"Our primary goal is creating an emotional experience for our guests,\" said Imagineer Michael Hundgen during a presentation at SXSW in Austin, Texas. \"For this Cars attraction, we need to invent a new type of ride vehicle. No one builds these in a factory because it has to do so much more than just carrying you from one place to another. We have to create a car that conveys a feeling when you ride in it.\"\n\nTo get a better idea of how everything will look and feel, Disney built a dedicated dirt track in Florida to simulate things like elevation changes, rocky bypasses, and high-speed off-roading. The company released a video showing Imagineers and executives traversing said course in Polaris RZRs.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, the final ride vehicles won\u2019t look like these run-of-the-mill off-roaders.\n\n\"We\u2019re using a customized production vehicle,\" Hundgen confirmed. \"It has sensors all over it, and we\u2019re taking it for test drives on our dirt track to gather data on how the vehicle responds to different terrain. This is where we turn that feeling we want into real-world engineering.\"\n\nPhoto by: Disney\n\nDisney and Pixar will create custom vehicles based on characters from the Cars franchise, including favorites like Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater. Plus, there will be a few other new characters we haven\u2019t seen yet, complete with rugged off-road elements, special names, and even racing numbers\u2014\"Just like a real race,\" Hunden says.\n\nDisney has already started construction of the new Cars attractions at its Magic Kingdom park, but the company says the new Cars land in Orlando likely won\u2019t be ready until 2028.

            "content": "When Disney has a new live-action adaptation on the way, it\u2019s usually accompanied by a live performance in front of a Disney castle, with the newest live-action princess singing their respective iconic song for an audience of fans. It\u2019s what was gorgeously done for The Little Mermaid\u2018s Halle Bailey, but as the release date for Snow White gets closer, it would appear at least stateside that star Rachel Zegler is not getting the same treatment. It\u2019s the latest in a long line of changes Disney has made with its approach to Snow White.\n\nZegler, who is playing the first fairytale heroine who helped build the company\u2014and who was plucked into the limelight by Steven Spielberg for West Side Story, with a voice that was meant for a Disney Princess\u2014will apparently not be getting her big Hollywood premiere, either. A report from Variety revealed that after the film\u2019s Japan stop, which was filled with magical performances by the actress and her dub counterparts, the Hollywood premiere will lock out journalists and will be more of a scaled-down event.\n\n\u201cThe afternoon festivities will include a pre-party and screening at the El Capitan Theatre with titular star Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, who plays the Evil Queen, expected to attend. However, the red carpet will not include the dozens of media outlets usually invited by Disney to interview the cast and creatives at its premieres,\u201d the trade reported. \u201cInstead, coverage will be limited to photographers and a house crew.\u201d\n\nThe theme of people rising to stand up for each another appears to be a main plot point in the Snow White adaptation, which also brings in another concern about the film. Could Disney possibly be hiding to play it safe amid the current political climate in the U.S., with conservatives easily alarmed by anything perceived to be too \u201cwoke\u201d? Is standing up against tyranny through kindness for one another, no matter our backgrounds, too \u201cnegative\u201d to publicly endorse?\n\nIt\u2019s beginning to feel like just another thing Disney has rolled back on to capitulate to conservatives, not unlike Pixar\u2019s Win or Lose trans storyline erasure. We\u2019ve seen Disney carefully allow Zegler to participate in pre-planned interviews where she\u2019s described those Snow White fans\u2014the ones who reacted in very clearly racist and bigoted ways to some of her early, PR-approved talking points about the new film differing from the original\u2019s outdated story. She continued to face ire after sharing her valid reaction to Trump\u2019s election, something that she later apologized for. The scaled-back premiere feels like way for Disney to avoid even more public scrutiny, especially considering the political controversy surrounding the stars of the film, including Gadot\u2019s support for Israel and Zegler\u2019s support for Palestine.\n\nPolitics aside, Snow White hasn\u2019t been without other controversies, including both backlash to the film\u2019s approach to the seven dwarfs and Zegler\u2019s own casting. The change to have CG dwarfs over human actors was due in part to Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage advocating for Disney to step away from stereotypical depictions on a podcast with Marc Maron back in 2022. He praised Disney for casting a Latina as Snow White but added, \u201cYou\u2019re progressive in one way and you\u2019re still making that f***ing backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together, what the f*** are you doing, man?\u201d\n\nAnd the hair, well let\u2019s just say if a woman was directing the film, that hair would not look like Lord Farquaad\u2019s\u2014but since it does, the internet has gleefully ganged up on Zegler over it. Again, if the movie is bad that\u2019s not the lead\u2019s fault; she has no creative say, but it\u2019s she who\u2019s been subject to that backlash, itself carrying a racial undertone from conservative critics.\n\nThis is the same Disney that stays radio silent whenever one of their major franchise players of color speaks out\u2014like John Boyega, who took a stand after years of facing racism online for being Black leading man in Star Wars. I guess we\u2019re adding Rachel Zegler to the list alongside Boyega and his fellow Star Wars veterans Kelly Marie Tran, Moses Ingram, Ahmed Best, and Amandla Stenberg.\n\nAnd yet Zegler, who\u2019s had to shake off the hate from \u201cpassionate fans\u201d, as she described them to Vogue, is being treated as a prop during a PR campaign where her voice should be celebrated for all the brown girls looking up to her. Girls who should most definitely not have those around them pushing to separate their families and villainizing marginalized identities labeled as just \u201cpassionate.\u201d\n\nThe fault doesn\u2019t just lie with Disney silence. Even culturally inspired films like Mufasa, which was a box office success, get heat from the same homogenous critical gazes on both sides of the spectrum, including those that the film might not have been made for. So instead of allowing a \u201cmid\u201d film shaped by intrusive studio-exec hands to take up space to build on by allowing more diverse voices to make and critique their art, it\u2019s simply pushed out of the zeitgeist. And Snow White feels like that, more pomp and circumstance internationally to bank on the Snow White IP in other markets that simply wouldn\u2019t necessarily care to reject a movie based on the actors\u2019 politics or race.\n\nHowever the film performs even with Disney\u2019s seeming hesitance to show it off remains to be seen\u2014its prior live-action remakes, for better or worse, have often weathered critical tepidness to achieve box office success. But just as it was with the reaction to Halle Bailey\u2019s Little Mermaid, to the audience in America who Zegler\u2019s time in the Disney spotlight matters, this apprehension on Disney\u2019s part feels like a letdown. Speaking as a Latina writer with a daughter, it\u2019s a shame that our closest representation on screen doesn\u2019t appear to be having the moment she deserves. Where\u2019s her Disney Parks counterpart? The movie is just days away and there\u2019s hardly any merchandise. Wicked\u2018s merch game started months before the release\u2014and that film, starring a Black Elphaba, was a massive hit. It\u2019s so wild that for a Latina Snow White, we\u2019re all of a sudden expected to accept this subdued of an effort.\n\nMeanwhile, the Latino audience makes up a powerful wing of the broader moviegoer market, according to a recent UCLA Hollywood Diversity report\u2014 \u201cAmong young female moviegoers, women of color, particularly Latinas, are key to driving ticket sales\u201d\u2014but it seems Disney is all too eager to ignore them. And yet, if Snow White doesn\u2019t match Disney\u2019s financial expectations, it\u2019ll be those audiences, or talent like Zegler, who are blamed rather than the studio that\u2019s been seemingly setting it up for failure. Is Disney too scared to stand on its choices once an anti-DEI leader gets in office? The decline in diversity on film, or rather not standing by casting and creative choices, speaks to taking a step forward but two steps back\u2014clearly a feature, not a bug, at Disney.",

            "content": "As Walt Disney once predicted, Disneyland will \"never be completed.\" It will continue growing \"as long as there is imagination left in the world.\" Disney's original theme park in Anaheim, California, is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year, and there's a lot of new rides, experiences and shows on the horizon -- both at Disneyland and at its 53-year-old counterpart in Florida, Walt Disney World.\n\nFrom new rides and new lands to huge park expansions, here's everything new coming to Disney Parks and the Disney Cruise Line in 2025 and beyond.\n\nDisneyland's 70th anniversary\n\nConcept art of how Sleeping Beauty Castle will look at Disneyland during the 70th celebration. Artist Concept/Disneyland Resort\n\nKicking off in mid-May is Disneyland's 70th birthday celebration. The original Disney park opened on July 17, 1955, but the birthday celebration begins two months early, on May 16, and continues for more than a year, running through summer 2026.\n\n\"Celebrate happy\" is the theme, and new events will include a Mickey and Friends cavalcade (including Duffy and ShellieMay); a projection show at It's a Small World called \"Tapestry of Happiness\" (as well as Miguel and Dante being added to the ride!) and a projection show at Carthay Circle; new outfits for Mickey and friends; and the World of Color Happiness show. The new World of Color show will be hosted by Joy from Inside Out, with the other Emotions manifesting movie moments from Pixar and Disney films including The Incredibles, Turning Red, A Goofy Movie, Encanto and Tangled.\n\nThe esplanade between Disneyland and California Adventure will be getting a 50-foot sculpture of Sleeping Beauty Castle, with more decorations sprinkled throughout Downtown Disney and Main Street USA, as well as inside Disney's hotels. There will even be 70th anniversary decor included in the Toy Story Midway Mania ride.\n\nConcept art of the 70th anniversary decor in Toy Story Midway Mania. Artist Concept/Disneyland Resort\n\nThe Paint the Night parade, Pixar Pals parade and Wondrous Journeys fireworks show will also be returning for the celebration.\n\nOn the official anniversary day of July 17, Disneyland will debut a new verse for It's A Small World, as well as a three-minute film called The Last Verse in the Main Street Cinema. The movie celebrates the Sherman Brothers, who wrote the music for the ride. There will also be a new gallery exhibition in the Opera House on Main Street USA, featuring never-before-seen images, art and artifacts from the development, opening and evolution of Disneyland. These include the original rocking chair, lamp and table from Walt Disney's private apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street; Walt's 1955 Emmy award; and his Presidential Medal of Freedom from 1964. There will be a second exhibit on the history of animatronics.\n\nThe first ever audio-animatronic figure of Walt Disney himself, as part of the Walt Disney: A Magical Life show inside the Main Street Opera House, will also debut on July 17.\n\nHow much are Disneyland tickets for the 70th celebration?\n\nAnother big drawcard for the 70th anniversary celebrations: ticket pricing.\n\nIf you're visiting Disneyland between May 16 and Aug. 14, 2025, you can buy tickets that are part of the Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer. These will cost $360 for a three-day, one-park-per-day ticket, or $400 for a four-day, one-park-per-day ticket.\n\nAvengers Campus is getting two more rides\n\nThe Avengers Infinity Defense ride Disney\n\nDisney's California Adventure, already home to the Spider-Man Web Slingers and Guardians of the Galaxy attractions in the Avengers Campus area of the park, will be getting two more Marvel attractions.\n\nDuring SXSW over the weekend, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, Imagineering chief creative officer Bruce Vaughn and Iron Man himself, Robert Downey Jr., revealed more details about these two new rides. Avengers Infinity Defense will see you assemble alongside the Avengers battling King Thanos, featuring appearances by Black Panther, Ant-Man and Hulk. Stark Flight Lab, the second ride, will see you help test Tony Stark's latest tech.\n\n\"In Stark Flight Lab, guests will sit in 'gyro-kinetic pods' and roll along a track before stopping in front of a giant robot arm,\" Disney explains on its Parks Blog. \"This robot arm will hoist you into the air where you'll make several high-speed maneuvers inspired by Iron Man and some other Avengers.\"\n\nConstruction begins this year on the Avengers Campus additions.\n\nA first look at the Pixar Cars rally race\n\nThe new Cars rally race ride. Disney\n\nThe Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island at Disney World's Magic Kingdom are being repurposed to add an area themed around Pixar's Cars movies. This expansion of Frontierland, which currently encompasses Tiana's Bayou Adventure and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, will get a Route 66 companion.\n\n\"To make way for this completely new frontier, the Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island will be transformed into vast and rugged terrains for a rally race with some of the world's most iconic racers,\" Disney said in a blog post last year.\n\nSXSW this past weekend also saw Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter and Imagineer Michel Hundgen talk about the new ride vehicle being invested for the Cars ride. You can watch a TikTok video of Disney Imagineers testing out off-road vehicles in the desert in Arizona in an effort to create what the ride will feel like.\n\n\"These are all things Lightning McQueen and Mater haven't experienced before, like racing over rocky terrain, ascending to mountain peaks, and dodging around geysers \u2014 how do you take these real-world elements and put a Cars spin on it?\" Disney Parks says in a blog post. Docter added that each rally car will have its own personality, name and racing number.\n\nDisney last year said there will be a second Cars-themed attraction, too. Cars Land, which was added to Disney's California Adventure back in 2012, remains popular in the west, so it was only a matter of time before it was added to the east. Work is set to begin this year, though there's no closing date yet for Tom Sawyer Island or the Liberty Square Riverboat.\n\nMonsters Inc. land and ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios\n\nDisney's first suspended roller coaster will take you on a ride through the Monsters Inc. factory. Disney/Pixar\n\nAnother new addition coming to Disney World at its Hollywood Studios theme park is a Monsters Inc.-themed area, to replace the current Muppets area (with the Muppets to replace Aerosmith theming in the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster).\n\nRevealed by the voice of Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), the land will let you stroll through Monstropolis from the Pixar movies and shorts. A new ride will also take you through the Monsters Inc. laugh factory aboard one of the doors to the human world \u2014 aka a suspended roller coaster.\n\n\"The first time I saw Monsters, Inc., all I wanted to do was ride on one of those doors like Mike and Sulley,\" D'Amaro said at D23 in August. \"You'll go into the factory and experience the first suspended coaster ever in a Disney park. Remember in the movie how those claws grab the doors and hoist them up into the air to take them away? We're doing that, too. And you're going along for the ride.\"\n\nDocter and Hundgen were also on-hand to talk about the new Monsters Inc. ride during SXSW, which \"will feature the first-ever suspended coaster at a Disney Park, and the first-ever vertical lift.\" The loading area will see you board the ride vehicle and then \"hoisted into the air.\" Here's the TikTok showing the design concept for the Monsters Inc. ride.\n\nYour last day to enjoy MuppetVision 3D is June 7. It'll close permanently on June 8. Work on the Monsters Inc. land will then begin later in 2025. There's no closing date yet for the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster.\n\nCalifornia Adventure is getting a Coco attraction\n\nConcept art for the new Coco ride. Disney/Pixar\n\nDisney's California Adventure is also getting more Pixar rides.\n\nA Coco attraction will be built in a yet-to-be-announced area of the park, but it sounds like it'll be a dark ride like Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, populated by Audio-Animatronics.\n\n\"The attraction will be filled with the characters \u2014 and music! \u2014 you know and love from the beloved movie, as you join Miguel on a trip to the land of the dead,\" Disney says.\n\nWork begins on the Coco ride in 2026, so its launch is still a while away.\n\nBluey says hello at Disneyland and Disney World\n\nMeet and greets with Bluey and her family will be coming to Disneyland and Disney World, as well as to Disney cruises, starting at an unspecified time in 2025. Disney announced this news after revealing that a Bluey movie will be hitting screens in 2027.\n\n\"Bluey has become a household name for families around the world, and we are thrilled to bring her story to life in new ways,\" said Disney Experiences Chair Josh D'Amaro. \"We can't wait to watch our youngest guests and their families make memories with Bluey in our parks and on our cruises.\"\n\nThe hugely popular Australian TV series about a family of dogs is a worldwide hit, with Disney to release the movie in two years' time. (In the meantime, you can watch Bluey episodes and minisodes on Disney Plus.)\n\nAn Avatar area is coming to Disneyland\n\nAn aerial shot of the Avatar-themed area coming to Disneyland Resort. Disney\n\nThe world of Pandora is expanding from Disney World's Animal Kingdom in Orlando to California Adventure in Anaheim. The area in California will take its design inspiration from the second Avatar film, The Way of Water, as well as the upcoming Avatar sequels.\n\nIt'll likely be part of the enormous Disneyland expansion coming to the theme parks that will push the boundaries past Downtown Disney and into the nearby parking lots. While Disney was short on details and dates, the Avatar experience will be \"dynamic, intense and emotional,\" with a dark boat ride much like Pirates of the Caribbean \"taking guests all the way to the wide-open seas of Pandora.\"\n\nDisney World's Magic Kingdom Villains Land\n\nDisney World's Magic Kingdom is getting a Villains Land. Disney\n\nVillains Land, which will celebrate all the classic baddies from Disney films, is coming to the Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, and it will be \"dark and thorny,\" according to the Horizons Disney Experiences Showcase (part of Disney's D23 expo in August) and info that Disney has released since.\n\nVillains Land was first teased during D23 2022. It'll be positioned on the other side of Big Thunder Mountain \u2014 aka, the top left edge of the current Magic Kingdom map \u2014 and will stretch around to where the Haunted Mansion is.\n\nTwo major attractions will be built in Villains Land, as well as dining and shopping \"on an incredibly twisted grand scale.\" The land is already being constructed, but no word yet on when it'll open.\n\nA chilling trailer for the chaotic land on Instagram hints at elements in the land representing Maleficent, Dr. Facilier, Ursula, Gaston, Yzma, Queen of Hearts, Hades, the Evil Queen, Lady Tremaine, Captain Hook, Jafar, Kaa, Madam Mim, Cruella, Scar, King Magnifico and Mother Gothel.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this: Disney Parks Announcements at D23 03:24\n\nTropical Americas land at Animal Kingdom\n\nDisney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World is replacing its DinoLand USA area with Tropical Americas. Though this had been previously announced, Disney confirmed a few more details in August: Pueblo Esperanza will feel like you're walking through a real village and will have a huge quick-service dining location, a fountain and a carousel.\n\nTropical Americas will also have a new Indiana Jones ride through a Maya temple and an Encanto-themed attraction where you'll explore Antonio's rainforest room inside the Casita.\n\nConstruction began in fall 2024, but DinoLand USA is closing down in stages. The Dinosaur ride (which will become the Indiana Jones ride) remains open, but TriceraTop Spin and the midway area closed down on Jan. 13.\n\nTropical Americas is planned to open in 2027.\n\nThe Tropical Americas area will replace DinoLand USA and feature an Encanto ride, an Indiana Jones ride and a carousel. Disney\n\nFour more ships for Disney Cruise Line\n\nIn addition to the Disney Wish, which launched in July 2022, the Disney Treasure, which set sail in December 2024, and the Disney Destiny, which is set to embark later this year, Disney is adding four more cruise ships to its ocean vacation lineup.\n\nThe ship names and destinations have yet to be revealed, but the ships will be setting sail between 2027 and 2031.\n\nDisney World and Disneyland: what else is coming?\n\nMando and Grogu are joining in the Millennium Falcon fun.

Valued at a market cap of $203.9 billion as of March 4, 2025, the company also offers popular direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Disney+ and Hulu in addition to its extensive theme parks and resort experiences worldwide.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) exceeded expectations in its fiscal Q1 2025 earnings report on February 5, posting earnings per share of $1.76, compared to analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.43. Revenue also came in higher than anticipated at $24.69 billion, surpassing the forecasted $24.55 billion. A key highlight was the entertainment streaming segment, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, achieving its second consecutive profitable quarter. The segment generated $293 million in operating income on $6.07 billion in revenue, marking a 9% year-over-year increase.

The young actresses, who portray \u201cBillie\u201d and \u201cWinter\u201d in the Disney series Wizards Beyond Waverly Place, met with the school\u2019s 4th and 5th-grade girls as part of the Little Cinderella Reporters initiative from the Saving Our Daughters organization.\n\nSaving Our Daughters (SOD) is a non-profit organization that works to eliminate social barriers by utilizing celebrity mentors that educate multicultural girls beyond the classroom setting and breaking down social constructs around bullying, mental health and low self-esteem.\n\nDressed in their reporter shirts, the Little Cinderella Reporters took turns using their signature microphones to interview the actresses. Questions ranged from the challenges of being an actress to the thrill of working alongside fellow cast members on Wizards Beyond Waverly Place. The young reporters asked, \u201cWhat is the hardest part about being an actress?\u201d \u201cIs it difficult sometimes to remember your lines?\u201d and \u201cDo you both get nervous when you act?\u201d Brown and Cora answered each question with warmth and honesty, providing the students with insight into their experiences in the entertainment industry.\n\nLittle Cinderella Reporters. Photo by Ashley Erikson.\n\nFollowing the Q&A, the girls snapped photos with the actresses, cementing an unforgettable moment to wrap up the last event of the school year. Past celebrity guests at Walt Disney Elementary have included Tiffany Boone (Mufasa), Marissa Bode (Wicked), Kensington Talman (Inside Out 2), Callah Lane (Wonka), and Mykal-Michelle Harris (Raven\u2019s Home). The visit by Brown and Cora added another inspiring chapter to the school\u2019s tradition of empowering young girls through storytelling and representation.\n\nWith the energy and enthusiasm of Brown and Cora lighting up the room, the young girls of Walt Disney Elementary left the event inspired and empowered, dreaming of their own futures\u2014whether on screen or beyond. The Little Cinderella Reporters initiative continues to spark conversations, build confidence, and connect students with role models who prove that dreams can, indeed, come true.",

It's essentially a canonization in the annals of film history that provides insight into the cultural sphere at the time. But while tastes have certainly changed since the ceremony's inaugural banquet in 1929, most award recipients have received the same golden statue that just about everyone is familiar with.\n\nThe Oscar, weighing 8 \u00bd pounds and standing 13 \u00bd inches tall, has largely stuck to the design of a sword-wielding knight. According to The Academy, the gold-plated bronze bastion of cinematic excellence settles atop a reel of film, with each spoke representing the institution's five original branches. Its form is the result of MGM art director Cedric Gibbons and LA sculptor George Stanley. The award's simplicity is only matched by its iconographic symbol and there doesn't seem to be any reason to change it.\n\nFor over a century, an Oscar has been the benchmark for industry success \u2014 even if it doesn't always lead to more opportunities. Plenty have won their own Knight of the Hollywood Guard, with some winning one multiple times. But no one has matched the record currently held in place by Walt Disney.\n\nHaving been nominated 59 times, Disney ultimately took home 26 statues, with most of them being for his animated shorts. 22 of those Oscars came from wins in competitive categories, while four of them were honorary accolades. Among those is one of the most interesting variations on the traditional gold statue that the Academy has ever conceived.",

Competing against approximately 80 teams from across the U.S., Morgan\u2019s M.O.D. Squad emerged victorious, showcasing their creativity, innovation, and design excellence on a national stage.\n\nThe M.O.D. Squad consisted of four outstanding students:\n\nGeoffrey Moore (B.S. Interior Design, Fall 2024 graduate)\n\nRicard Charles (M.Arch, Spring 2024 graduate)\n\nJesscarly Ramos (B.S. Architecture and Environmental Design, Fall 2024 graduate)\n\nCatherine Scharbach (B.S. Interior Design, graduating Spring 2025)\n\nMike Pucher\n\nGuided by Assistant Professor Howard Mack, who is himself a former 2007 Disney Imagineering competition finalist, the team competed this past fall while most of the members were still enrolled as students. Their achievement reflects Morgan\u2019s commitment to academic excellence and highlights the University\u2019s growing presence in architecture, environmental design, and innovation.\n\nMorgan State University had an impressive showing in this year\u2019s Disney competition. Three teams from Morgan successfully advanced through the early rounds, becoming Quarterfinalists and Semifinalists, with two teams reaching the Top 10 finalists. Ultimately, the M.O.D. Squad claimed the top prize in this celebrated competition.\n\nAs finalists, the team earned an all-expenses-paid trip to Disney\u2019s headquarters in California, where they presented their project to Disney Imagineering executives\u2014the innovative minds behind Disney\u2019s theme parks, resorts, cruise ships, and entertainment venues worldwide.\n\nThe Challenge: Reinventing Urban Transportation with a Disney Twist\n\nThe competition tasked students with reimagining transportation in a major city, incorporating Disney\u2019s signature storytelling, creativity, and immersive guest experiences while ensuring the system was accessible, energy-efficient, and engaging. Artificial intelligence was not allowed, challenging students to develop solutions rooted in design ingenuity and human-centered innovation.\n\nProjects were judged on design mastery, guest experience, cultural awareness, uniqueness, and business impact, as well as the team\u2019s ability to tell a compelling, immersive story\u2014a hallmark of Walt Disney Imagineering.\n\nThe first-place winning M.O.D. Squad\u2019s Oasis Rail project earned them an award and a $1,000 grant for their university. The students were also presented with exclusive job and internship opportunities with Walt Disney Imagineering.\n\nFor nearly thirty years, the Imaginations Competition has been a launching pad for aspiring designers, engineers, and storytellers. Many past winners went on to intern with or work for Walt Disney Imagineering, helping to design and build the Disney experiences that captivate audiences worldwide.\n\nMorgan State University\u2019s continued success in high-profile national competitions, like the Walt Disney Imagineering Imaginations Design Competition, reaffirms its commitment to excellence in architecture, design, and STEM education. By providing students with hands-on learning experiences, industry partnerships, and faculty mentorship, Morgan is cultivating the next generation of innovators who will shape the future of design, urban planning, and immersive storytelling.\n\nCongratulations to the M.O.D.

            "content": "The one constant at Walt Disney World is change. Walt Disney promised that Disneyland would \u201calways be in a state of becoming\u201d and that sentiment has remained true, not simply for Disneyland but for all Disney Parks. (It also holds true for all the theme parks around the world.) There is always going to be something new in the parks, and frequently adding something shiny and new can only happen if they tear down something old.\n\nIn general, most parkgoers do not like to lose classic attractions, but between the two extremes of keeping everything the same, and replacing it with something new, I have always been on the side of championing the new. Losing old favorites is always sad, but it was a price I have been willing to pay to get the newest piece of creative theme park design.\n\nHowever, I have recently begun to have a significant change of heart on this particular topic. Hear me out.\n\n(Image credit: White Lake Productions)\n\nTheme Parks Are Not Museums, But Maybe Some Parts Should Act Like Them\n\nThe statement \u201ctheme parks are not museums\u201d is an oft-repeated one. It\u2019s a sentiment that in a lot of ways I would agree with. Museums are about looking at the past, and while nostalgia is absolutely a major element of Disney Parks, so is looking toward the future.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine a Disney Park in a stagnant state and never changing. The idea that you could visit Magic Kingdom decades apart and have an identical experience is about the most boring thing in the world to me. There\u2019s always something new at Disney World whenever I visit and that\u2019s part of what makes every trip feel new and fun.\n\nThen I had the chance to speak with Joshua Bailey, director of the new documentary film Stolen Kingdom. While the majority of the new film deals with the urban exploring of defunct Disney World attractions and the black market for stolen goods, all of that is, at least to some degree, related to the feeling that classic Disney World attractions should be preserved. As the movie journalist Seth Kubersky says in the doc:\n\nIf you say a theme park is not a museum, you\u2019re also implying that themed attractions are not art.\n\nWhile I have always viewed themed entertainment as an art form, one that has some absolutely incredible artists, and incredible inventors involved in it, this line really did make me take a look at things in a slightly different way. Removing a themed attraction isn\u2019t simply the removal of an experience that a guest can no longer have, it\u2019s also the removal of a creative work put together by an entire team of artists and inventors.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAs somebody who doesn't mind that the Star Wars Special Edition exists, but doesn't like that the original version of the Star Wars trilogy has been basically erased from existence, I would be a hypocrite if I didn't feel the same way about themed entertainment. Which brings me to what's realistic to expect.\n\n(Image credit: Wakt Disney World/Abigail Nilsson)\n\nDisney World Only Expanding Isn't Realistic\n\nThemed attractions are art. That shouldn\u2019t even be a topic of debate, but even if we are all on the same page about this, the preservation of that art is a complicated issue. How does one determine which attractions are worthy of preservation and which are not? If all attractions are worth preserving over the long haul, then how do you possibly grow?\n\nWalt Disney World certainly has the gift of size and as such there is a lot of empty space that can conceivably be used to build new attractions. Magic Kingdom will be doing exactly that with the forthcoming Villains Land. Even Disneyland is planning a massive expansion even though it doesn't have nearly the space. However, the idea that all of the existing parks can be left alone and that everything new can just be added as expansion doesn\u2019t work for me, either.\n\nDisney World is twice the size of the island of Manhatten but making Magic Kingdom the size of Queens, while perhaps technically possible, isn\u2019t realistic. For there to be new stuff there must also be the end of at least some of the old stuff, and that\u2019s where the decisions get difficult.\n\n(Image credit: Disney Experiences)\n\nA Balance Between Preservation And Invention At Disney World Will Always Be Difficult\n\nIn some cases, preservation is a bit easier. Upon announcing the closing of Muppet*Vision 3D at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios, Disney World said it was working on a way to preserve the attraction in some way.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear right now what that means. On a simple level, it could mean releasing the film on Disney+ or even on Blu-ray so people can still watch it. At a more extreme level, it could even mean potentially reopening the attraction in a new location down the road. In the case of an attraction that is primarily a film, preservation is significantly easier.\n\nHowever, when we\u2019re talking about the removal of the Rivers of America from Frontierland, preservation becomes essentially impossible. I\u2019ve already written about I\u2019m actually excited for what is to come in Fontierland, as radical reinvention isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Here, though, Disney World isn't simply replacing attractions, it's fundamentally altering the structure of the park and that has implications both good and bad.\n\nIt\u2019s all but certainly too late for the Rivers of America. If there was ever a chance of it surviving, that likely ended as soon as the transformation was officially announced. I still hope the new Frontierland will be something special. I still believe it can be. But we will lose something with the transformation that we\u2019ll never get back, and that is sad.\n\n(Image credit: Disney Experiences)\n\nI Still Don\u2019t Think Theme Parks Should Be Entirely Static\n\nWhile I\u2019m starting to change my tune on closing old attractions, that doesn\u2019t mean I have an entirely different perspective. I still want the new attractions; I still think that the new attractions are necessary; I also believe that will sometimes require the closing of older attractions.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the solution is. I don\u2019t know how to find the balance but I do think there needs to be a balance. Closing old attractions isn\u2019t always the wrong choice, but replacing them with new ones isn\u2019t always the right choice either.\n\nThere's a word, anemoia, which means \"nostalgia for a time that you never experienced.\" It's a word I discovered specifically because I have always felt nostalgia for eras of Disney parks I never visited. While many Disneyland World and Disneyland attractions from opening day are still there, so many more are gone. I'll never get to ride them, but I will always wish I could have.\n\nLosing theme park attractions is a loss of art that can never be recreated. It's a loss of an experience that will never be had again or may never be had at all. At the end of the day, I want Disney Parks to keep moving forward, but I'll also never forget again what they're moving away from.",

The Walt Disney Company\u2019s 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is set to take place on March 20th, 2025 and we\u2019re expecting some major updates from the company.\n\nSix potential announcements stand out, and we think there\u2019s a decent chance we may hear something on these fronts.\n\nSubscription Perks and Changes Coming to Disney+\n\nDisney+ underwent some massive changes last year with crackdowns on password sharing as well as price increases. Could more changes be coming up?\n\nDisney+ also offers perks for its subscribers, like ticket discounts and other benefits. Disney+ is usually a major topic at events like these, so it\u2019s possible that future updates will be announced.\n\nDisney Parks Expansion Updates\n\nWe spend every day at theme parks, so it\u2019s only natural that we want to hear more about the Disney Parks expansion projects!\n\nIn the U.S., Magic Kingdom is getting a Villains Land and Cars expansion, Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios is getting a Monsters, Inc. Land, Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom is getting a Tropical Americas Land, and the Disneyland Resort is getting a massive expansion with new lands, hotels, shopping, dining, and more.\n\nExpansion talk has been quiet since the D23 expo, so we\u2019re hoping to hear some more updates during the meeting.\n\nStatus of the Disney Cruise Line Fleet Expansion\n\nLast August at D23 2024: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event, Disney announced that the Disney Cruise Line would be adding four new ships to its fleet, bringing it to a total of 13 ships by 2031.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to learn more about the future of the Disney Cruise Line!\n\nBox Office Report\n\nDisney had a great year at the movies in 2024, with massive successes from films like Inside Out 2, Moana 2, & Deadpool and Wolverine.\n\n2024 was considered a nice bounce-back year for Disney at the box office and we\u2019re curious to see what the 2025 projections look like. Marvel has some big hitters coming out this year as does Pixar so it\u2019ll be interesting to see what the movie outlook is heading into the summer blockbuster season.\n\nDisney Parks Profit/Loss Trends\n\nThis one is almost certainly a given, but we should get a good look at the Disney Parks\u2019 profit trends during the meeting.\n\nGiving an in-depth look at each Disney park worldwide, we should be able to see how each is doing financially and the kinds of trends they\u2019re showing.\n\nPost-pandemic, these measurements have become indicative of overall theme park trends and how the public have responded to theme parks in this new era.\n\nThe Status of Disney\u2019s Sports Entertainment Investments\n\nWhile Disney manages the very successful ESPN brand, it is also expanding its footing in the sports world.\n\nWhile Disney has ESPN, ESPN+, and sports on Disney+, it was supposed venture out with the new Venu streaming service.\n\nThe service would\u2019ve combined coverage from Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros., but was ultimately canceled earlier this year. We\u2019re wondering if we\u2019ll get any update as to what\u2019s next for Disney and sports.\n\nOf course, these announcement expectations are all speculative, but you can catch the actual announcements LIVE via the Virtual Shareholder Meeting on Thursday, March 20th, 2025 at 10 AM PT. You can find the link HERE.\n\nFor coverage of the meeting and of all things Disney, stay tuned right here at AllEars!\n\nJoin the AllEars.net Newsletter to stay on top of ALL the breaking Disney News!

            "content": "For more than a century, The Walt Disney Company has been looking to the future by mixing its artistry with its innovative technology. Working seamlessly across the company, Disney has crafted a world of its own \u2014 one in which new advances in technology are bringing the stories that unfold on-screen, and the stories guests experience in-person, closer than ever before.\n\nOn Saturday, Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D\u2019Amaro and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman explored Disney\u2019s unique power to connect creativity with innovative experiences at the company\u2019s featured session at the South by Southwest\u00ae (SXSW\u00ae) conference in Austin, Texas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly developing new tools that allow us to tell our stories in even more compelling ways. It\u2019s a seamless blend of art and science we take directly from our founder, Walt Disney. He was our original visionary and innovator,\u201d D\u2019Amaro said to kick off the company\u2019s session, The Future of World-Building at Disney, on Saturday.\n\nIn front of a packed crowd, Bergman echoed D\u2019Amaro\u2019s sentiments by noting that at Disney it all starts \u201cwith great storytelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe work with the best storytellers to dream up new worlds full of heart, fun, and imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cWe truly have something for everyone, with so many ways to experience it. This helps us have strong connections with our audience, which is so unique to Disney.\u201d\n\nHere is a look inside the company\u2019s featured session at SXSW \u2014 including some of the exciting announcements that Disney revealed on Saturday.\n\nThe Art of Collaboration\n\nD\u2019Amaro and Bergman began the session on Saturday by focusing on Disneyland, which is celebrating its 70th anniversary in July.\n\n\u201cDisneyland is an incredibly special place. It\u2019s our original park. It\u2019s the only one Walt physically walked through during his life,\u201d D\u2019Amaro said. \u201cWhen he began working on this new venture in the early \u201950s, there really wasn\u2019t anything quite like it at that point. So, to turn this dream into reality, he went to the people he trusted most. He went to his storytellers.\u201d\n\nBergman explained that Walt reassigned a small group of animators from the movie studio to design this new experience to bring these stories to life.\n\n\u201cEventually, he coined a new term for these creative geniuses \u2013 he called them \u2018Imagineers,\u2019\u201d D\u2019Amaro said.\n\nBergman added that \u201cthe key to all of this is the partnership we have between our two teams. And we start that collaboration very early on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite parts of my job is joining Josh and his team early in those concept meetings, where we get to see our stories and characters take on a whole new life,\u201d Bergman continued.\n\nBecause at Disney, according to D\u2019Amaro, stories don\u2019t \u201cend when the credits roll on a film, or when you walk out the front of one of our parks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey keep growing and they keep evolving,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd one of the best examples of this type of world-building is taking place in a galaxy far, far away\u2026\n\nA Galaxy of Innovative Storytelling\n\nThe next part of the World-Building session focused on the iconic Star Wars brand. D\u2019Amaro and Bergman brought out Imagineers Leslie Evans and Asa Kalama, as well as The Mandalorian and Grogu director and Disney Legend Jon Favreau. Not to mention, a flock of BDX droids.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working in robotics at Imagineering since the very beginning. Walt really saw this technology as a cool way to bring characters to life,\u201d Kalama said. \u201cThink tiki birds, Abraham Lincoln, it\u2019s a small world, but obviously today the technology has really come incredibly far.\u201d\n\nHowever, unlike the animatronics of the past, the BDX droids can learn and teach each other. This process, called reinforcement learning, is an entirely new way to program animatronic characters, according to Evans.\n\nShe explained that the BDX droids walk freely around and explore environments, interacting with guests and each other. To achieve this, Imagineers built digital avatars of the droids and set them loose in a virtual environment \u2014 thousands at a time.\n\n\u201cThey learn, they experiment, they teach each other, and they figure out how to navigate different types of terrain,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re training in simulation, we\u2019re not just teaching them to balance, we\u2019re teaching them how to learn to walk as characters and imitate those core animations that really give them their personality.\u201d\n\nAs for Favreau, he revealed that the BDX droids \u2014 which first appeared at Disneyland \u2014 will be making their on-screen debut in next year\u2019s The Mandalorian and Grogu \u2014 another showcase of the seamless connection between Disney\u2019s studios and its experiences.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. The droids will be visiting Walt Disney World, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris later this year.\n\nAnd Kalama explained that the popular Star Wars attraction Millennium Falcon: Smuggler\u2019s Run at Disneyland and Walt Disney World will be getting an update which takes guests into the world of The Mandalorian for Memorial Day weekend 2026 \u2014 the very same weekend The Mandalorian and Grogu movie debuts in theaters.\n\n\u201cThis really all goes back to what Alan and Josh were just talking about \u2014 the incredible collaboration between our teams. I mean, opening an attraction and such a big movie like this on the same day, it really wouldn\u2019t be possible without the relationships we have inside Disney,\u201d Kalama said.\n\nThe Specificity of Pixar and Disney Imagineering\n\nStar Wars isn\u2019t the only Disney brand that benefits from the collaboration between Studios and Experiences. Pixar, the beloved and award-winning animation studio, has seen its footprint grow at Disney parks and resorts over decades.\n\n\u201cWe at Pixar have been working with Imagineering for a long time creating these incredible experiences, all over the world,\u201d Pete Docter, Pixar\u2019s Chief Creative Officer, said on stage. \u201cWe\u2019re such fans of the Disney parks, we even use them as a sort of test for ourselves. When we\u2019re coming up with the sets and environments, we ask ourselves, \u2018Is this somewhere I\u2019d want to go if they built it at Disneyland?\u2019\u201d\n\nDocter continued by saying that in the end, the filmmakers at Pixar and the Imagineers rely on a fundamental principle in everything they do: specificity.\n\n\u201cGetting to know all the little details and getting those right, that\u2019s how we build authenticity into our worlds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has to feel real because that\u2019s what allows you to believe in the story.\u201d\n\nImagineer Michael Hundgen joined Docter on stage to talk about two new Pixar projects in the works for Walt Disney World, starting with an amazing new attraction that takes guests on a rip-roaring ride through the door vault in the company\u2019s first land inspired by Monsters, Inc.\n\n\u201cWe have never done anything like this before,\u201d Hundgen said of the new attraction. \u201cIt\u2019s Disney\u2019s first suspended coaster, it\u2019s our first vertical lift. We\u2019re designing this experience to be as memorable and as fun as the film itself.\u201d\n\nThe other innovative Pixar attraction coming to Disney World is an off-road rally race inspired by Cars.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re designing our attractions, our primary goal is to create an emotional experience for our guests, just like the filmmakers do on the screen. For this Cars attraction, we need to invent a new type of ride vehicle to create that feeling,\u201d Hundgen said.\n\nHe continued by saying that Imagineers took a trip out to the Arizona desert and rented some off-road vehicles to ride along different trails. This helped them bring authenticity to the story. The Imagineers took everything they learned during their trip to build a custom dirt track with geometry similar to what they liked on the trails.\n\nThen, once the data was collected, it was time to start working on the attraction vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe workload on our ride vehicles far exceeds a normal car,\u201d Hundgen said. \u201cThey run 12 hours a day, 7 days a week for decades. If your car does 13,000 miles a year, ours go up to 65,000 miles every year, depending on the attraction. And on top of that, we\u2019re running it on this really tough terrain.\u201d\n\nDocter concluded the Pixar section of the session by returning to the theme of specificity.\n\n\u201cLike I said at the beginning \u2014 specificity is key. You can see here the level of detail the Imagineers are going for. Now imagine that applying to everything, every part of the attraction,\u201d Docter said. \u201cThat\u2019s the standard [Imagineers] set, and we\u2019re proud to work alongside Imagineering these many years to really try to bring our movies out there into authentic Pixar experiences.\u201d\n\nThe Fantastic World-Building of Marvel\n\nNext up was Marvel, Disney\u2019s blockbuster Super Hero brand, and what would a conversation about innovation and Marvel be without\u2026 Iron Man?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m digging this wild blend of art, science, and culture that SXSW has become,\u201d Disney Legend Robert Downey Jr., Tony Stark himself, said surprising those in attendance on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s the place to be!\u201d\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t alone. Kevin Feige, Producer and President of Marvel Studios, and Bruce Vaughn, the President and Chief Creative Officer for Walt Disney Imagineering, also joined Downey Jr. on stage.\n\n\u201cJust like my colleagues at the other studios, I\u2019m a giant, giant Disney parks fan,\u201d Feige said. \u201cI\u2019m always drawn to the places that showcase Walt\u2019s vision for the future \u2014 particularly Tomorrowland and EPCOT. They share a mid-century, retro-futuristic design language that I love\u2026 In fact, it\u2019s served as an inspiration for our new film coming out this summer, The Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d\n\nVaughn shared that guests will be able to see the entire Fantastic Four at Disneyland this summer. Disney Imagineering is creating a real-life Herbie robot from the film, too.\n\n\u201cThis is what is so great about our teams collaborating the way they do \u2014 we\u2019re always coming up with crazy ideas that we know our guests will love,\u201d Vaughn added.\n\nHe noted that Disney recently broke ground on a massive expansion for Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure \u2014 doubling the size of the land with two incredible new attractions.\n\nThe first: Avengers Infinity Defense, which will have guests assemble the Avengers to battle King Thanos across multiple worlds. That includes fighting alongside Black Panther, Ant-Man, and the Hulk, among other heroes.\n\n\u201cI think it is by far the largest collection of heroes we\u2019ve ever put into an attraction,\u201d Feige said.\n\nThe other attraction is Stark Flight Lab, which hits close to home for Downey Jr.\n\n\u201cTony opened my eyes wider to the power technology has to impact the world for good, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll carry with me the rest of my days,\u201d Downey Jr. said.\n\nVaughn added that Downey Jr. will be reprising his role in the attraction, which takes you inside Tony\u2019s workshop filled with cutting-edge tech. That includes a massive robot arm that reaches down, grabs a guest\u2019s pod, and lifts them off the track, where they will make several high-speed maneuvers inspired by Iron Man and some other Avengers. After your flight, the arm sets you back on the track and you zip away again.\n\nVaughn continued by telling the audience that Downey Jr. was invited to Imagineering to see what Disney is working on as well as help them get the details right.\n\n\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know was how stealth and exclusive Walt Disney Imagineering headquarters was,\u201d Downey Jr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Area 51 of Fun.\u201d\n\nDowney Jr. added that even after Disney finishes Stark Flight Lab, he\u2019d like to stick around.\n\n\u201cI want to stay involved for the long haul. I want to be part of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, this isn\u2019t a one-time deal, and I say this with all the humility I can muster, you need more\u2026 me.\u201d\n\nA request that D\u2019Amaro and Bergman were more than happy to make happen.\n\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to ask us twice,\u201d Bergman said returning to the stage with D\u2019Amaro.\n\n\u201cAnytime you want to want to come over to Imagineering, you are welcome,\u201d D\u2019Amaro added. \u201cTony Stark lives on forever with us.\u201d\n\nDowney Jr. then quipped, \u201cso that\u2019s a verbal confirmation. It\u2019s binding. I thank you for stating it with 2,000 witnesses.\u201d",

            "content": "As Walt Disney once predicted, Disneyland will \"never be completed.\" It will continue growing \"as long as there is imagination left in the world.\" Disney's original theme park in Anaheim, California, is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year, and there's a lot of new rides, experiences and shows on the horizon -- both at Disneyland and at its 53-year-old counterpart in Florida, Walt Disney World.\n\nFrom new rides and new lands to huge park expansions, here's everything new coming to Disney Parks and the Disney Cruise Line in 2025 and beyond.\n\nDisneyland's 70th anniversary\n\nConcept art of how Sleeping Beauty Castle will look at Disneyland during the 70th celebration. Artist Concept/Disneyland Resort\n\nKicking off in mid-May is Disneyland's 70th birthday celebration. The original Disney park opened on July 17, 1955, but the birthday celebration begins two months early, on May 16, and continues for more than a year, running through summer 2026.\n\n\"Celebrate happy\" is the theme, and new events will include a Mickey and Friends cavalcade (including Duffy and ShellieMay); a projection show at It's a Small World called \"Tapestry of Happiness\" (as well as Miguel and Dante being added to the ride!) and a projection show at Carthay Circle; new outfits for Mickey and friends; and the World of Color Happiness show. The new World of Color show will be hosted by Joy from Inside Out, with the other Emotions manifesting movie moments from Pixar and Disney films including The Incredibles, Turning Red, A Goofy Movie, Encanto and Tangled.\n\nThe esplanade between Disneyland and California Adventure will be getting a 50-foot sculpture of Sleeping Beauty Castle, with more decorations sprinkled throughout Downtown Disney and Main Street USA, as well as inside Disney's hotels. There will even be 70th anniversary decor included in the Toy Story Midway Mania ride.\n\nConcept art of the 70th anniversary decor in Toy Story Midway Mania. Artist Concept/Disneyland Resort\n\nThe Paint the Night parade, Pixar Pals parade and Wondrous Journeys fireworks show will also be returning for the celebration.\n\nOn the official anniversary day of July 17, Disneyland will debut a new verse for It's A Small World, as well as a three-minute film called The Last Verse in the Main Street Cinema. The movie celebrates the Sherman Brothers, who wrote the music for the ride. There will also be a new gallery exhibition in the Opera House on Main Street USA, featuring never-before-seen images, art and artifacts from the development, opening and evolution of Disneyland. These include the original rocking chair, lamp and table from Walt Disney's private apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street; Walt's 1955 Emmy award; and his Presidential Medal of Freedom from 1964. There will be a second exhibit on the history of animatronics.\n\nThe first ever audio-animatronic figure of Walt Disney himself, as part of the Walt Disney: A Magical Life show inside the Main Street Opera House, will also debut on July 17.\n\nHow much are Disneyland tickets for the 70th celebration?\n\nAnother big drawcard for the 70th anniversary celebrations: ticket pricing.\n\nIf you're visiting Disneyland between May 16 and Aug. 14, 2025, you can buy tickets that are part of the Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer. These will cost $360 for a three-day, one-park-per-day ticket, or $400 for a four-day, one-park-per-day ticket.\n\nAvengers Campus is getting two more rides\n\nThe Avengers Infinity Defense ride Disney\n\nDisney's California Adventure, already home to the Spider-Man Web Slingers and Guardians of the Galaxy attractions in the Avengers Campus area of the park, will be getting two more Marvel attractions.\n\nDuring SXSW over the weekend, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, Imagineering chief creative officer Bruce Vaughn and Iron Man himself, Robert Downey Jr., revealed more details about these two new rides. Avengers Infinity Defense will see you assemble alongside the Avengers battling King Thanos, featuring appearances by Black Panther, Ant-Man and Hulk. Stark Flight Lab, the second ride, will see you help test Tony Stark's latest tech.\n\n\"In Stark Flight Lab, guests will sit in 'gyro-kinetic pods' and roll along a track before stopping in front of a giant robot arm,\" Disney explains on its Parks Blog. \"This robot arm will hoist you into the air where you'll make several high-speed maneuvers inspired by Iron Man and some other Avengers.\"\n\nConstruction begins this year on the Avengers Campus additions.\n\nA first look at the Pixar Cars rally race\n\nThe new Cars rally race ride. Disney\n\nThe Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island at Disney World's Magic Kingdom are being repurposed to add an area themed around Pixar's Cars movies. This expansion of Frontierland, which currently encompasses Tiana's Bayou Adventure and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, will get a Route 66 companion.\n\n\"To make way for this completely new frontier, the Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island will be transformed into vast and rugged terrains for a rally race with some of the world's most iconic racers,\" Disney said in a blog post last year.\n\nSXSW this past weekend also saw Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter and Imagineer Michel Hundgen talk about the new ride vehicle being invested for the Cars ride. You can watch a TikTok video of Disney Imagineers testing out off-road vehicles in the desert in Arizona in an effort to create what the ride will feel like.\n\n\"These are all things Lightning McQueen and Mater haven't experienced before, like racing over rocky terrain, ascending to mountain peaks, and dodging around geysers \u2014 how do you take these real-world elements and put a Cars spin on it?\" Disney Parks says in a blog post. Docter added that each rally car will have its own personality, name and racing number.\n\nDisney last year said there will be a second Cars-themed attraction, too. Cars Land, which was added to Disney's California Adventure back in 2012, remains popular in the west, so it was only a matter of time before it was added to the east. Work is set to begin this year, though there's no closing date yet for Tom Sawyer Island or the Liberty Square Riverboat.\n\nMonsters Inc. land and ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios\n\nDisney's first suspended roller coaster will take you on a ride through the Monsters Inc. factory. Disney/Pixar\n\nAnother new addition coming to Disney World at its Hollywood Studios theme park is a Monsters Inc.-themed area, to replace the current Muppets area (with the Muppets to replace Aerosmith theming in the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster).\n\nRevealed by the voice of Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), the land will let you stroll through Monstropolis from the Pixar movies and shorts. A new ride will also take you through the Monsters Inc. laugh factory aboard one of the doors to the human world \u2014 aka a suspended roller coaster.\n\n\"The first time I saw Monsters, Inc., all I wanted to do was ride on one of those doors like Mike and Sulley,\" D'Amaro said at D23 in August. \"You'll go into the factory and experience the first suspended coaster ever in a Disney park. Remember in the movie how those claws grab the doors and hoist them up into the air to take them away? We're doing that, too. And you're going along for the ride.\"\n\nDocter and Hundgen were also on-hand to talk about the new Monsters Inc. ride during SXSW, which \"will feature the first-ever suspended coaster at a Disney Park, and the first-ever vertical lift.\" The loading area will see you board the ride vehicle and then \"hoisted into the air.\" Here's the TikTok showing the design concept for the Monsters Inc. ride.\n\nYour last day to enjoy MuppetVision 3D is June 7. It'll close permanently on June 8. Work on the Monsters Inc. land will then begin later in 2025. There's no closing date yet for the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster.\n\nCalifornia Adventure is getting a Coco attraction\n\nConcept art for the new Coco ride. Disney/Pixar\n\nDisney's California Adventure is also getting more Pixar rides.\n\nA Coco attraction will be built in a yet-to-be-announced area of the park, but it sounds like it'll be a dark ride like Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, populated by Audio-Animatronics.\n\n\"The attraction will be filled with the characters \u2014 and music! \u2014 you know and love from the beloved movie, as you join Miguel on a trip to the land of the dead,\" Disney says.\n\nWork begins on the Coco ride in 2026, so its launch is still a while away.\n\nBluey says hello at Disneyland and Disney World\n\nMeet and greets with Bluey and her family will be coming to Disneyland and Disney World, as well as to Disney cruises, starting at an unspecified time in 2025. Disney announced this news after revealing that a Bluey movie will be hitting screens in 2027.\n\n\"Bluey has become a household name for families around the world, and we are thrilled to bring her story to life in new ways,\" said Disney Experiences Chair Josh D'Amaro. \"We can't wait to watch our youngest guests and their families make memories with Bluey in our parks and on our cruises.\"\n\nThe hugely popular Australian TV series about a family of dogs is a worldwide hit, with Disney to release the movie in two years' time. (In the meantime, you can watch Bluey episodes and minisodes on Disney Plus.)\n\nAn Avatar area is coming to Disneyland\n\nAn aerial shot of the Avatar-themed area coming to Disneyland Resort. Disney\n\nThe world of Pandora is expanding from Disney World's Animal Kingdom in Orlando to California Adventure in Anaheim. The area in California will take its design inspiration from the second Avatar film, The Way of Water, as well as the upcoming Avatar sequels.\n\nIt'll likely be part of the enormous Disneyland expansion coming to the theme parks that will push the boundaries past Downtown Disney and into the nearby parking lots. While Disney was short on details and dates, the Avatar experience will be \"dynamic, intense and emotional,\" with a dark boat ride much like Pirates of the Caribbean \"taking guests all the way to the wide-open seas of Pandora.\"\n\nDisney World's Magic Kingdom Villains Land\n\nDisney World's Magic Kingdom is getting a Villains Land. Disney\n\nVillains Land, which will celebrate all the classic baddies from Disney films, is coming to the Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, and it will be \"dark and thorny,\" according to the Horizons Disney Experiences Showcase (part of Disney's D23 expo in August) and info that Disney has released since.\n\nVillains Land was first teased during D23 2022. It'll be positioned on the other side of Big Thunder Mountain \u2014 aka, the top left edge of the current Magic Kingdom map \u2014 and will stretch around to where the Haunted Mansion is.\n\nTwo major attractions will be built in Villains Land, as well as dining and shopping \"on an incredibly twisted grand scale.\" The land is already being constructed, but no word yet on when it'll open.\n\nA chilling trailer for the chaotic land on Instagram hints at elements in the land representing Maleficent, Dr. Facilier, Ursula, Gaston, Yzma, Queen of Hearts, Hades, the Evil Queen, Lady Tremaine, Captain Hook, Jafar, Kaa, Madam Mim, Cruella, Scar, King Magnifico and Mother Gothel.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this: Disney Parks Announcements at D23 03:24\n\nTropical Americas land at Animal Kingdom\n\nDisney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World is replacing its DinoLand USA area with Tropical Americas. Though this had been previously announced, Disney confirmed a few more details in August: Pueblo Esperanza will feel like you're walking through a real village and will have a huge quick-service dining location, a fountain and a carousel.\n\nTropical Americas will also have a new Indiana Jones ride through a Maya temple and an Encanto-themed attraction where you'll explore Antonio's rainforest room inside the Casita.\n\nConstruction began in fall 2024, but DinoLand USA is closing down in stages. The Dinosaur ride (which will become the Indiana Jones ride) remains open, but TriceraTop Spin and the midway area closed down on Jan. 13.\n\nTropical Americas is planned to open in 2027.\n\nThe Tropical Americas area will replace DinoLand USA and feature an Encanto ride, an Indiana Jones ride and a carousel. Disney\n\nFour more ships for Disney Cruise Line\n\nIn addition to the Disney Wish, which launched in July 2022, the Disney Treasure, which set sail in December 2024, and the Disney Destiny, which is set to embark later this year, Disney is adding four more cruise ships to its ocean vacation lineup.\n\nThe ship names and destinations have yet to be revealed, but the ships will be setting sail between 2027 and 2031.\n\nDisney World and Disneyland: what else is coming?\n\nMando and Grogu are joining in the Millennium Falcon fun. Disney\n\nHere's what else is new and coming to the theme parks:",

            "content": "For the uninitiated, let's clear something up: prior to the release of the 1937 animated film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" Walt Disney was a more frequent director of the short animated pieces released by his fledgling studio. A large chunk of those shorts were grouped as Silly Symphonies, meant to imply that the shorts would be musically driven while telling a brief story. And as was the case with many of the feature films released by Disney in their earliest days, many of the Silly Symphonies were inspired by or directly adapting fairy tales.\n\nIt's easy to envision some of the examples among the features, from \"Snow White\" to \"Cinderella\" to \"Sleeping Beauty,\" but the same was true for the Silly Symphonies, such as \"The Golden Touch.\" If the name doesn't say it clearly enough, this 1935 short was inspired by the tale of King Midas, the man with the golden touch. As in the old-fashioned story, this time around, Midas realizes that when he has the power to turn anything into gold, it means that he can't do much in the way of taking care of himself, instead forgoing his powers by giving away everything he owns to the clever elf (named Goldie, naturally) so he no longer has the golden touch.\n\nNow, they sometimes say that each of us can be our own worst critic, so you may assume that Disney being so against \"The Golden Child\" after it was made and released in 1935 is just a situation where an artist is too hard on himself. The good news is that you can see for yourself on Disney+ what the end result was; although the streaming service has arguably not done nearly enough in including as many older pieces of animation as possible for animation fans and amateur historians alike, \"The Golden Touch\" is one of the few you can stream right now. That's the good news. The bad news is that ... Disney may have been right about its poor quality.",

            "content": "Films work best when they derive from the depths of the director's imagination. Films have the unique power of visually transporting audiences to other worlds. I view animation to be film in its purest form. There is no other visual medium that is as limitless as animation. An animator is not bound to the restraints of the real world, and creativity can be set free.\n\nAnimation is true \u201cmovie magic,\u201d and no company is more representative of this than the Walt Disney Company. Walt Disney famously pioneered the industry by making the first animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in 1937. This artistic marvel changed the film industry forever. Disney has since built a brand on selling magical, animated stories with deep, emotional cores.\n\nTalking lions may entertain you as a child, but the humanity and emotion within these lions keep you coming back. Disney truly did understand the power of animation.\n\nThe key word is \u201cdid,\u201d as those days are behind us.\n\nWith the emergence of \u201clive-action remakes,\u201d Disney has begun to sell brands over stories, valuing marketing more than artistic vision and animation.\n\nWith the fascination of remakes, we have lost our way artistically and started our descent into the depths of the cultural abyss surrounded by a self-referential generation who lacks their own unique identity.\n\nI\u2019m sure many of you have seen one of Disney\u2019s remakes\u2014it\u2019s a business of theirs that has grown over the years. This year, we have three new Disney remakes releasing: \u201cLilo and Stitch,\u201d \u201cMoana,\u201d and \u201cSnow White.\u201d\n\nI find the \u201cSnow White\u201d release to be the most interesting of the three, especially when juxtaposed with its release in 1937\u2014a film that was considered a gamble by most at the time. Walt Disney originally made the film with the artistic vision that it was revolutionary for animation. It was this idea of innovation that led audiences to adore this film and is a pivotal part of its success.\n\nThe re-release is not revolutionary in the slightest, and it\u2019s quite the contrary. A formulaic copy of the original, selling itself to you based on you adoring the original. The saddest part of this is that it works. It has proven to be a very beneficial business model, and removing the creative process from your production does wonders for your budget.\n\nTo see this decline in creativity has been unfortunate, to say the least. An art form built on imagination and innovation, destroyed in the name of corporate greed. The greatest example of this is Disney\u2019s live-action, \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lion King\u201d is one of Disney\u2019s most beloved stories and has remained a cultural phenomenon since its release in 1994. It was only right to release a remake in 2019. Just saying that I find the depiction of this remake as a \u201clive-action\u201d is comical. This entire movie is still animated, only it\u2019s in a less fun and interesting way. This movie makes zero sense to me. Getting rid of the drawn animation for a hyper-realistic style that removes expression and humanity from its animal characters was interesting.\n\nThe sets are less engaging, the musical scenes lack the excitement of the original, and simply put, it is not better than the 1994 version. Disney understands this and has no intent of making it better than the original. They saw the movie as a money-making machine, not needing the artistic vision of the original, and they were correct.\n\nFrom a monetary perspective, this was a hit and remains one of Disney\u2019s highest-grossing movies of all time. I remember hearing of this movie's success and feeling just as hopeless as Simba felt leaving Pride Rock. Mufasa was just thrown off the cliff by Scar (spoiler, sorry), but this time, it was Disney throwing its artists to the wildebeests.\n\nThis all falls into a larger relationship between my generation and pop culture: nothing is ours. Most of the art Gen-Z consumes is derived from previous generations. Films, shoes, and even the Grimace craze are all redistributions from previous artistic visions. There is a lack of artistic innovation, and in its place, nostalgia has taken over. Nostalgia is great and all, but we cannot consume it as art. If we are to do this, where will our nostalgia come from? I want to have the same relationship with art that my parents have with the art made in their childhoods in the 1980s.\n\nAt the moment, this seems like a daunting task. I cannot show my kid's remakes and have that positive relationship with art as my parents did before me. For this to be accomplished, we need to have a more mindful consumption of media. This is even more important in the age of AI; art is a humanistic process, and the exploitation of technology is shameful and unethical. We cannot remain complacent during the dilution of the artistic process. An artistic revolution similar to the one started by Disney in 1937 starts with us.\n\nI understand I have been somewhat negative throughout this piece, and I wanted to end on a positive note. Things are looking down for art, but there is still hope. While corporations remain complacent during the unraveling of creativity, we can be a part of the change in media consumption.\n\nThere is a spark of creativity in all of us, and I encourage all of you to ignite that. While technology has taken a toll on creativity, it can also be helpful in the distribution of your creativity. The only way to inspire future artists is to create engaging art for them. This process is very circular, and it requires our engagement.\n\nI brought up the point earlier that in culture, nothing belongs to my generation. Go out there and change that, use social media as a tool to create what you want. Let your creativity run free on these apps, and who knows, maybe your spark could light the fire for the next artistic revolution.\n\nMyles Goodreau is a writer for The Setonian\u2019s Opinion section.

On Saturday, Downey Jr. surprised a crowd of nearly 2,000 in Austin, Texas to preview a pair of upcoming Marvel-themed rides coming to Avengers Campus in Disneyland. And yes, he will be reprising his role as Tony Stark.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 17 years of being associated with an iconic superhero, but it is the message he represents that I am grateful for,\u201d Downey Jr. told the crowd. \u201cTony opened my eyes wider to the power technology has to impact the world for good, and that is something I will carry with me for the rest of my days.\u201d\n\nRobert Downey Jr. appears at the Disney panel at #SXSW to talk about what Tony Stark means to him pic.twitter.com/w0GTgurDXQ \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) March 8, 2025\n\nDowney Jr. was the surprise guest at the Disney panel at SXSW Saturday, fronted by Disney Experiences chairman Josh D\u2019Amaro and Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman. The pair of execs were joined in cameo appearances by a veritable who\u2019s who of Disney A-listers, including Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige, Pixar\u2019s Pete Docter, The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau and Disney Imagineering chief Bruce Vaughn.\n\nThe purpose? To demonstrate Disney\u2019s prowess at taking characters from the screen and bringing them to life at the company\u2019s theme parks and experiences around the world.\n\n\u201cFor us, it all starts with great storytelling, and that\u2019s beginning, the middle and the end for us with each of our brands,\u201d says Bergman in a joint interview alongside D\u2019Amaro with The Hollywood Reporter, conducted ahead of the panel. \u201cAnd we\u2019re fortunate because obviously we have Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Lucasfilm and Avatar. So we\u2019re also able to, with great stories, build great worlds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis goes back to Walt when he envisioned what this company ultimately was going to be,\u201d says D\u2019Amaro. \u201cHe had storytelling and content in the middle and all of these businesses surrounding it, such that we could stay with the consumer, wherever they were, literally in the world.\u201d\n\nBergman and D\u2019Amaro each play a pivotal role on Disney\u2019s IP flywheel. The Disney film studios, which Bergman oversees, develop the characters and franchises and build the worlds. D\u2019Amaro\u2019s team, which includes Disney Imagineering, turns those characters and worlds into real tangible experiences building the emotional connection to Disney that helps define the company.\n\nAt the SXSW panel, the creatives (along with a few BDX droids, the Mandalorian and Grogu from Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge) joined the chairmen on stage to explain how they work to take the characters they create for the screen and develop them for Disney\u2019s experiences, be it a theme park land or attraction or a cruise ship spinoff.\n\n\u201cOur filmmakers like Kevin Feige or Pete Docter, they\u2019re huge, huge parks fans as well,\u201d Bergman says. \u201cSo as they are developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe and what it has in it, or our animated titles, whether it be Pixar or Disney, Frozen and Zootopia: As they\u2019re envisioning their films, they get the story, and then they\u2019re able to expand the world. It\u2019s a great extension of what we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore even a movie is hatched, sometimes we\u2019re having discussions about, can you imagine what this could be? And of course, then the rest of the team is going to take the lead on that,\u201d D\u2019Amaro adds. \u201cFrom a parks and experiences standpoint, Alan and his team invite us in very early in the process, sometimes before there\u2019s even a script. So the Imagineers will be talking to a Pete, talking to a Kevin on imagining what these spaces might look like in physical form and now in the future in digital form as well [in Disney\u2019s upcoming Epic Games world in development].\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why when you walk into a Cars land, or you walk into Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge, or a Guardians of the Galaxy, you feel the same thing that you feel when you\u2019re in the theater watching that movie for the first time,\u201d D\u2019Amaro continues.\n\nAnd they used the SXSW stage to unveil a number of announcements coming to Disney\u2019s parks.\n\nFirst up was a look a look at new Star Wars entries, with Mandalorian filmmaker Jon Favreau joining Disney imagineers in introducing Austin to the BDX droids and an animatronic droidsmith that will be seen walking around the Disney parks. And Disney will bring a brand new mission to Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run that is inspired by Favreau\u2019s upcoming Star Wars feature, The Mandalorian & Grogu, a ride which will debut the same weekend as the film over Memorial Day weekend 2026.\n\n\u201cAs much as I like going in to the park where I feel like a kid, I love seeing backstage. You realize that there is a lot of technology, but at its heart are these people who are passionate about storytelling,\u201d said Faverau, who shouted out the SXSW film festival where his feature Chef premiered in 2014 before leaving the stage.\n\nAfter Star Wars, Disney took the Austin audience to the world of Pixar, with chief creative officer Pete Docter saying that the Disney parks are frequently in the thoughts of its animators. Said Docter, \u201cWe ask ourselves: \u2018Is this somewhere I want to go if they build it at Disneyland?\u2019\u201d Doctor\u2019s movie Monsters Inc. is the inspiration for a new rollercoaster modeled on the film\u2019s \u201cdoor vault\u201d sequence where characters cling to suspended closet doors. It will be Disney\u2019s first suspended roller coaster, with the preview earning \u201cooh\u201ds and \u201caah\u201ds from the audience. Additionally, a new ride inspired by Cars at Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom will be a recreation of an off-road rally race filled with new \u201crace car personalities\u201d created by Pixar.\n\n\u201cThe Cars franchise is so, so powerful, clearly evergreen, something that we\u2019ve had a lot of success with in Disney California Adventure,\u201d D\u2019Amaro says. \u201cSo we see a great opportunity at Walt Disney World building another Cars themed area. And while technology may not be in the forefront of the consumer\u2019s mind, the technology that we will use to translate what Pete and the team have created to an off-road rally race is going to be phenomenal in terms of the how the car moves, how it reacts to the terrain, how it makes you feel you are out in in the wilderness, really experiencing what the cars would experience.\u201d\n\nClosing out the presentation was Marvel head Kevin Feige who brought out the surprise guest, Robert Downey Jr., who elicited the biggest audience reaction of the panel.\n\nDisney is doubling the size of the Avengers campus at the Disneyland Anaheim park. The new ride Stark Flight Lab will take guests inside Tony Stark\u2019s technology workshop, where they will sit inside a \u201cgyrokinetic pod\u201d rolling along a track and be picked up by lines of robotic articulating arms.\n\nDowney, who has been working directly with Disney imagineers on the new attraction, said: \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know was how stealth and exclusive Walt Disney Imagineering HQ was. You want to talk about a closed set? It\u2019s the Area 51 of fun!\u201d\n\nThey also announced that the Fantastic Four characters will appear at Tomorrowland.\n\nPerhaps no franchise defines Disney\u2019s approach better than Pirates of the Caribbean, which traces its origins to Disneyland and Walt Disney himself, before becoming a film franchise that led to new elements being added to the original rides, namely Johnny Depp\u2019s Jack Sparrow. The Disney flywheel in full effect.\n\n\u201c[Pirates is] a parks IP that goes over into the studios, and these guys make incredible content from that, and that cycle has repeated itself as well,\u201d D\u2019Amaro says.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest rides that you have at any of the parks is in Shanghai, that Pirates ride,\u201d Bergman continued, recalling how he took Pirates of the Caribbean producer Jerry Bruckheimer to preview it early on in development. \u201cWe were actually at [Imagineering] sitting in one of these little rolling chairs, looking at cardboard, no joke, really early on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you were like, \u2018I hope you guys can pull this off,\u201d D\u2019Amaro replied.\n\n\u201cIt blew away our expectations, it\u2019s so amazing,\u201d Bergman said. \u201cLook, we\u2019re going to be making another Pirates movie. So it\u2019s just great. It really is great.\u201d",

New food, expansions, shows, and more have been and will continue to grace \u201cThe Most Magical Place on Earth.\u201d Orlando trips also get a little more complicated now that Universal is making some serious strides with its new Epic Universe theme park. With that in mind, certain non-spoken rules for Disney World are going to look very different \u2014 not only this year, but in the years to follow.\n\nNext time you visit Disney World, you might want find yourself abiding by these five \u201cnew\u201d rules.\n\nSpend Less Time at Disney World and More Time at Epic Universe\n\nEpic Universe is the shiny new toy, so we can\u2019t blame anyone who wants to prioritize a visit during their next Orlando trip.\n\nDisney World vacations are a serious time and monetary commitment, and planning a long trip that gives ample time to visit both Disney World and Universal isn\u2019t always doable.\n\nTherefore, in 2025, you\u2019d be totally forgiven for neglecting Disney World (which has a ton of projects in progress that won\u2019t open this year) in favor of Universal and Epic Universe, which fully intends to flex its muscles this year. We can also totally see why people are cutting their trips to Disney World short so they can experience Epic Universe (especially since 1 day tickets aren\u2019t available). Plus, what\u2019s cooler than experiencing a brand-new theme park in its first year?!\n\nStay On-Property\n\nWe always share why we think staying on property is a good idea for Disney World. But we don\u2019t shy away from sharing that staying off property has its perks too. But the perks of staying on property have just increased now that Disney is offering free water park access on your check-in day.\n\nThe perk is new to the Disney World Resort and was introduced just this year.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Typhoon Lagoon and/or Blizzard Beach, or have ever wanted to visit the Disney World water parks, this is a great way to do that without incurring any extra cost. So staying on property will really be more worthwhile if you are planning to go to the water parks during your trip.\n\nPrioritize Attractions About to Leave Disney World\n\nWe previously mentioned that Disney World is undergoing a serious makeover. Unfortunately, that includes getting rid of some fan-favorite attractions.\n\nDINOSAUR in Animal Kingdom will remain open throughout 2025. Soon, it will close to make way for the Tropical Americas Land and a brand-new Indiana Jones ride.\n\nRock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster in Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios is also losing its Aerosmith theme as it gives way to a Muppets retheme. The closure date for Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster has yet to be announced.\n\nMuppets Courtyard in Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios is also going to be closing for good to make way for the new Monsters, Inc. Land. The closure will happen in parts. The last day you\u2019ll be able to dine at Mama Melrose\u2019s will be on May 10th. Muppet*Vision 3D and PizzeRizzo will close on June 7th. On June 8th, the Muppets Courtyard will be completely walled off and closed.\n\nOver at Magic Kingdom, Rivers of America, Liberty Square Riverboat, and Tom Sawyer Island are all closing at some point when the park begins to build its new Cars expansion in Frontierland. Hopefully, we will have more details on those closures and their timelines soon.\n\nWe\u2019ll let you know those dates as soon as they\u2019re announced.\n\nDon\u2019t Pull Stunts for Social Media Clout\n\nTikTok is back after a VERY brief hiatus, and so is the social media craze. There\u2019s not much to say on this except that showing respect should always take priority over gaining social media clout.\n\nDon\u2019t treat character interactions as a social media stunt. For starters, you\u2019re taking up everyone\u2019s time when you do this. Then, there are stunts that can be disrespectful and degrading. Seriously, showing respect should ALWAYS be a Disney rule.\n\nShow Patience When Waiting to Ride Cosmic Rewind\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at EPCOT recently switched from virtual queue to standby, so you should prepare for some pretty long waits.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll never ever be able to predict how long a wait will be before your trip, but you should prepare to wait over an hour-plus.\n\nWhen in doubt, you can always pay for Lightning Lane Single Pass to skip the standby line!\n\nThese are just a few new \u201crules\u201d or situations you may find yourself in this year.

            "content": "During sailings aboard Disney Cruise Line\u2019s new ship, the Disney Treasure, guests are invited to dive deep into an extraordinary journey in Disney The Tale of Moana, a Broadway-style show inspired by Walt Disney Animation Studios\u2019 2016 feature film Moana.\n\n\u201cAudiences are primed to come in and have a good experience,\u201d the show\u2019s director, Connor Gallagher, said. \u201cThey\u2019re not rushing in from traffic or coming here after a bad day at work. They\u2019re coming in to have a theatrical experience and see characters they love come to life. They\u2019re coming from a place of love \u2014 and that creates such a nice energy.\u201d\n\nAs the show begins, the Walt Disney Theatre transforms from the fictional island of Motunui into the open ocean as Moana embarks on an epic voyage to save her people. Disney The Tale of Moana features vibrant dancing, choreographed by Gallagher and Peter Rockford Espiritu; songs in a mix of languages, including Tuvaluan, Tokelauan, and Samoan; and the first live staging of \u201cWarrior Face,\u201d inspired by traditional Haka. Adding to the spectacle is larger-than-life puppetry, including Te K\u0101 \u2014 the largest puppet that Disney Cruise Line has ever created. In the grand finale, the massive lava monster towers over the audience before Moana helps her transform into the benevolent mother island, Te Fiti.\n\n\u201cAs the first-ever stage production of Moana, this production means a lot to all of us,\u201d said Kaena Kekoa, who plays Moana. \u201cAfter several years of rehearsals, it\u2019s nice to finally be able to share this with people and for them to receive it.\u201d\n\nSetting the Stage\n\nAccording to Gallagher, the show was in development for four years before it opened.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I love most about working with everyone in Disney Live Entertainment is that they really support the collaborative process,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cI invited all of the designers in as early as possible so that I wasn\u2019t ordering up ideas and effects too late in the process. We collaborated throughout, and we asked each other, \u2018What if we tried this?'\u201d\n\nAs the Disney Treasure was being constructed, the creative team behind Disney The Tale of Moana worked together to creatively adapt the story of Moana for Disney Cruise Line guests to enjoy at sea.\n\n\u201cIn those initial workshops, we tried to make the show work without all the bells and whistles,\u201d Gallagher recalled. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of technology in the show that you see in the Walt Disney Theatre, like puppetry and video, but when we first did the show, it was like children\u2019s theater with foam core and popsicle sticks. We found the emotional core of the story and the main elements, and then everyone started to layer on top of that. It gave us the ability to zoom out and look at how the story was landing, to see how we wanted to make it more impactful and epic. We wanted it to be a spectacle without losing the heart and the emotion. It required a lot of conversation, a lot of trial and error, and a lot of time.\u201d\n\nRound of Applause\n\nWhile the Walt Disney Theatre is also home to the enchanting musical Beauty and the Beast (inspired by the 2017 live-action film) and the original stage spectacular Disney Seas the Adventure, Disney The Tale of Moana holds a special place in the cast and crew\u2019s hearts.\n\n\u201cThis kind of show requires a lifestyle shift. A lot of people are rooted in their lives on land \u2014 but this show is different,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cA lot of our actors came from the very first workshop in 2020, which is rare. That speaks to how much this story means to them, so it\u2019s extra meaningful for me to be a part of something that people hold so dearly.\u201d\n\nKekoa added, \u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind of emotions \u2014 but the biggest one is pride. I\u2019m so proud to see our show being so well received. Everybody loves Moana, and everybody can relate to her. We are all Moana. It\u2019s a lot of responsibility for everyone, but we\u2019re so proud.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Disney Cruise Line or to book a vacation, guests can visit disneycruise.com, call Disney Cruise Line at 888-325-2500, or contact their travel agent.",

Now, production workers at Walt Disney Animation Studios have ratified the first union contract EVER, according to Variety.\n\nThis historic agreement was reached after production workers overwhelmingly voted to unionize in February 2023. The ruling declares that full-time production coordinators, production supervisors, and production managers are eligible to unionize with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839.\n\nThe new contract gives production workers protections that include both pension and health benefits, as well as wage increases. These wage increases include a 24% increase for production managers, a 29% increase for production supervisors, and a 35% increase for production coordinators (who are generally the lowest-paid workers in production).\n\nProduction supervisor Nicholas Ellingsworth said, \u201cIn Hollywood, we love an underdog story. Our ratification was just that \u2014 the underrepresented and underpaid coming together and demanding better pay and equity with our artistic counterparts. In the end, we were heard and seen, and we have a pathway to further improving the conditions in which production management works.\u201d\n\nDreamWorks Animation\u2019s production workers are also now working towards their first union contract.\n\nCheck back with AllEars again soon for more.\n\n\ufeff\n\nJoin the AllEars.net Newsletter to stay on top of ALL the breaking Disney News!

The five-time Emmy-nominated writer/producer of The Mandalorian and 2016\u2019s live-action The Jungle Book remake is bringing a new vision of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit to screens, according to Deadline.\n\nFirst introduced in the short Trolley Troubles (1927), Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, and starred in 27 Walt Disney Studio cartoons before being snapped up by Universal Pictures. By hopping away from the studio, Oswald left an opening for a different shorts-sporting rodent to take the Disney spotlight and change animation history: Mickey Mouse.\n\nWhen an Oswald-themed video game was pitched in 2003, then-President of Disney Bob Iger became determined to bring the bunny back into the studio\u2019s stable of characters, and The Walt Disney Co. acquired the trademark from NBCUnivesal in 2006. The character made his big return in the 2010 video game Epic Mickey, and has since appeared in theme parks, comics, follow-up games and merch.\n\nOswald returned to animation after an 85-year absence in the Oscar-nominated 2013 short Get a Horse!, making a brief cameo in the throwback toon. He also makes a quick appearance in the 2023 hybrid short Once Upon a Studio. He finally starred in own modern short in 2022, which was directed by celebrated Disney veteran Eric Goldberg and released to YouTube as part of the ramp-up to Disney\u2019s 100th Anniversary celebrations.\n\nFavreau is currently directing and producing The Mandalorian and Grogu for Lucasfilm, due to launch on Disney+ in 2026.\n\n[Source: Deadline]",

            "content": "There\u2019s nothing in the world quite like a Disney World vacation. As a professional theme park writer, I know the resort well, and I\u2019ll be the first to tell you it can be a truly magical experience. Having said that, it\u2019s also a very expensive experience, and with each passing year, it seems to only get more complex. Now, one mom who recently went on a Disney World vacation is going viral for voicing her feelings, and even those who love the parks are forced to agree.\n\nA TikTok is blowing up after a mother of two posted that she doesn\u2019t expect that her family\u2019s recent trip to Walt Disney World will be repeated anytime soon. The reasons include, unsurprisingly, the cost, but more specifically that she doesn\u2019t feel her family got their money\u2019s worth considering all the cash and time that was spent to make the trip happen. Check it out:\n\nThe woman says she \u201cfelt stressed\u201d during her trip, and at the end of the day, that\u2019s the last thing you want to feel on a vacation anywhere, never mind at a theme park resort like Disney World. Things should be relaxing, but when trying to navigate return times for rides, food reservations, and everything else, it\u2019s not a shock that things got overwhelming.\n\nShe\u2019s certainly not the first to complain about Disney World being expensive or the process of planning being frustrating and time-consuming. However, what\u2019s most interesting about the absolute flood of comments that have been posted to the video is that a lot of people who are self-professed Disney World fans, who understand the systems more than most, are fully on board with the problems. Comments include\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a pass holder and go every week you\u2019re 100% right the whole thing is ridiculous now -svanah2j\n\nDisney adult/DVC member here \u2014 you are not wrong. People have different tolerances for some of your complaints, but overall it is over priced, overcrowded and over complicated compared to 10 years ago -JStever711\n\nAfter our recent Disney Cruise, my husband termed a new phrase for when you get nickeled and dimed after already paying a premium. You\u2019re getting \u201cMickey Moused\u201d -Cherithalt\n\nTotally agree. I\u2019m old enough that I remember the days when you just went and enjoyed. There was no pre-planning or reservations for food. So much better. -Whiterabbitstories\n\nThere are certainly those comments that are critical that she \"doesn't understand\" or blaming her for doing something wrong, but even accepting that as true, it's sort of the point. One should not need an advanced degree or special knowledge in order to visit Walt Disney World and have a good time. The fun should be easy, or it's not fun.\n\nI recently went on a true vacation with my own family to Disneyland, which, to be fair, is not nearly as complex an endeavor as Walt Disney World. Still, as somebody who knows how it all works, I very much threw money at the problem to try and have the most fun possible. But then, I\u2019m somebody very well-versed in how it all works. For a first-timer, it can absolutely be too much.\n\nAt the end of the day, it sounds like the kids had fun, which is the real goal. Still, Disney parks are for everybody, not just kids, and it would be nice if the adults didn't have to work so hard.",

            "content": "Forum Forums\n\nPosted:\n\nDisney is setting the stage for theme park announcements and updates this weekend as Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D'Amaro and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman take the spotlight at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas.\n\n\n\nThe annual festival, known for showcasing the latest in film, music, and interactive media, will feature Disney's presentation, \"The Future of World-Building at Disney,\" on Saturday, March 8, at 12:30 p.m. ET. The session promises insights into the future of storytelling at Disney Parks and beyond, focusing on the intersection of imagination and innovation. Disney is encouraging fans to follow along for live updates and announcements from the event.\n\n\n\nAhead of tomorrow's panel, D\u2019Amaro and Bergman talk about what brings Disney to SXSW, how the interplay between innovation and storytelling comes together.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is not thought of as a technology company. So, why is it holding a presentation that focuses on innovation at SXSW?\n\nD\u2019Amaro: Innovation is one of the core principles of our company \u2014 and has been for more than 100 years. We use \u2014 and invent \u2014 new technology to tell our stories in exciting, compelling ways. From robotics to ride vehicles to how we render the media in our attractions and so much more, technology is integrated into everything we do. So, of course, it makes sense for us to tell that story at SXSW, to demonstrate how we use technology to give our guests experiences they never dreamed possible.\n\nWe live in a world right now where even some of the best storytelling can be forgotten. However, Disney stories are generational. How does the interaction between the studios and the parks make the company\u2019s stories everlasting?\n\nBergman: Everything we do starts with great storytelling, and we\u2019re fortunate to have the very best storytellers at Disney no matter where you look within the company. A big reason our storytelling can withstand the test of time is the ability for people to experience our stories in so many ways \u2014 from our movies and TV shows to our parks, cruise ships, and consumer products. Those experiences are meaningful and can be shared and passed down across generations.\n\nAt the heart of it all is the creative collaboration that\u2019s built into how we operate. The first Imagineers were actually drawn from Walt\u2019s filmmaking team, and they developed many attractions based on films like Snow White, Peter Pan, and Dumbo that are still beloved today.\n\nHow is the interplay between on-screen storytelling and experiential storytelling something that only Disney can do?\n\nD\u2019Amaro: One of our company\u2019s core strengths is the incredible collection of storytellers we have under one roof. They all work together to make imagined worlds feel real. Those stories take many forms \u2014 from movies and TV to parks, cruise ships and consumer products \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes Disney so special. Our storytellers collaborate across disciplines to bring our characters to life in new ways. Because a Disney story doesn\u2019t end when the credits roll or when you walk out the park\u2019s front gate \u2014 they keep growing and evolving.\n\nWhat is the most important aspect of the connection between artistry and technology?\n\nBergman: Since Disney was founded, it\u2019s been driven by bringing art and technology together. That\u2019s put us at the forefront of many advancements, from Walt\u2019s early shorts and the first animated feature, Snow White, to the many innovations in production technology and animatronics from our teams across the company including ILM, Pixar, and Imagineering.\n\n\n\nWe view technology as an essential tool that makes us better storytellers and helps us create more immersive and compelling entertainment experiences. It\u2019s especially helpful to have artists who understand technology and vice versa, and we\u2019re lucky to have incredibly talented people like that who can also collaborate really well together.\n\nHow does Disney Experiences fuel innovative storytelling at the Studios?\n\nD\u2019Amaro: Storytellers across our company are constantly spurring one another on to do great work. We\u2019ve seen classic park attractions inspire major motion pictures \u2014 Pirates of the Caribbean, The Haunted Mansion and the Jungle Cruise, just to name a few. And it goes deeper than that. Because Imagineers work so closely with our studios, our filmmakers are often excited to explore how their worlds might translate into immersive experiences for our guests.\n\nHow does storytelling at the Studios fuel innovations at Disney Experiences?\n\nBergman: They go hand in hand, and you see that every time you step into one of the parks. The influence of the films has been there since the beginning and has grown as the company has grown. Our studio\u2019s creative teams build incredible worlds, and Disney Experiences takes those worlds and brings them to life, allowing guests to become part of the adventure. And in some cases, like with Pirates of the Caribbean, it can even go the other way. Not to mention that many of the creative leaders and storytellers at the Studio are huge Disney Parks fans themselves. So the teams draw inspiration from one another and we ensure that we maintain close connections throughout the storytelling process and in how we bring those stories to life in the parks and elsewhere.\n\nYou can watch the event livestream below, and stay tuned for more as Disney shares what's next.",

            "content": "Writer\u2019s Note, News & Views\n\nI had a couple of unique Disney experiences this week.\n\nBy way of background for those that do not know, I have been a Disney Vacation Club member since 2000 (yes, I hit the 25 year mark in February), and I moved from Chicago to a house closer to Magic Kingdom (but not on Disney property) than any of my DVC \u201chome\u201d resorts back in 2014. I have attended the DVC annual meetings for many of the years since I moved to the neighborhood which, in addition to the legal formalities of the scripted business meeting, provided an opportunity to hear from DVC leadership, mingle with them while enjoying the post-meeting cookies and characters events.\n\nThanks to the 2024 changes in Florida law requiring condo associations to have quarterly board meetings, each of the Florida condo associations that operate Disney Vacation Club properties separately held their meetings earlier this week at the conference center at Disney\u2019s BoardWalk Resort. Only members on the property deed (the legal instrument that makes you a DVC Member) are allowed to RSVP and attend these quarterly meetings. My schedule did not allow me to attend the individual meetings in December 2024, but I did attend the DVC Member gathering that replaced the old combined Annual Meeting and gathering.\n\nThe DVC quarterly meetings happened to also fall on the first day of EPCOT International Flower & Garden Festival, so I decided to not only RSVP to attend the meetings for the properties where I own points (Beach Club, BoardWalk, and Old Key West), but to make a reservation to visit EPCOT (since Passholders still need reservations on most days to get in to the park before 2 p.m.). I parked at EPCOT and took the 25 minute stroll from my parking space way out in Rocket (that\u2019s toward the northeast part of the parking lot) through the park gates, World Celebration (including CommuniCore Hall), the western walkway to World Showcase past Imagination pavilion, Canada pavilion, and the United Kingdom, and then out the International Gateway (in the southeast corner of the park), and over to Disney\u2019s BoardWalk Resort\u2019s conference center. So far, none of that was a unique Disney experience for me.\n\nI checked in for the meetings: Beach Club (noon), BoardWalk (1:15 p.m.), and Old Key West (5 p.m.). I do not recall ever being in meetings or an event in BoardWalk conference center, so this was somewhat of a unique experience for me already, but the more unique part was that I was the only DVC Member that showed up to the meeting room for the Beach Club meeting.\n\nThanks to prior DVC meetings and some of the media events I have been invited to over the years, I have had other opportunities to talk to DVC leadership. At the Beach Club meeting, I had the opportunity to meet (and/or reintroduce myself to) several board members and other DVC cast, and the meeting was addressed, in essence, personally to me. The business of the meeting was just as routine as I expected and not particularly newsworthy: the main update item about Beach Club that you may already know about is the ongoing extensive refurbishment of Stormalong Bay, the feature pool at Disney\u2019s Yacht and Beach Club Resort.\n\nThe BoardWalk meeting started with me being the only DVC Member in the room, and, in addition to meeting the Resort\u2019s General Manager and more DVC cast, the board addressed its remarks personally to me. Again, the business details were routine: the lobby refurbishment is complete, the room refurbishments are complete and, like the newer DVC resorts, in many places in the guest rooms, carpeting has been replaced with flooring (which I view as a positive in that it keeps the rooms looking less worn).\n\nDuring the BoardWalk Q&A, I asked about and the board confirmed the news that JellyRolls is closing its BoardWalk venue in April, and the board is searching for new tenants to occupy both that space and the Big River restaurant space. The Board provided no timeline and confirmed that the lack of lessees for these venues does not impact member dues. Before the Q&A ended, another couple who were also DVC members joined the meeting and asked whether DVC had any plans to expand parking at BoardWalk. The board said it had no plans to expand the parking lot at BoardWalk and the BoardWalk General Manager said that they have stepped up efforts to make sure that the resort has parking available for all guests with room reservations and dining reservations by issuing and monitoring the use of placards. (As I noted above, I parked at EPCOT for these meetings, and, of course, the resort does not want guests going to EPCOT or Hollywood Studios but not staying at BoardWalk to park there.)\n\nThe time between the BoardWalk and Old Key West meetings was not convenient enough to both get back to the Flower & Garden Festival and then the meeting, so I decided not to stick around (and cancelled my check in).\n\nI will say to those of our readers that are DVC Members who want to ask questions to the DVC leaders, these meetings seem like a great place to do that. DVC leadership are, of course, bound by a whole lot of legal restrictions that relate to the timeshare industry, and that limits their ability to address questions about future plans for DVC and such, but, even at the past Annual Meetings, the DVC leadership has always been rather solicitous of serious guest questions relating to the operation of the resorts and the guest experience. When the next quarter\u2019s meeting dates are set, I will check my calendar and whether I have questions (or you have provided me with questions) that I should bring to DVC leadership.",

Now he is combining the two with a new series in development at Disney+, Deadline has learned.\n\nThe animation/live action hybrid is about Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a saucy, self-absorbed bunny. Favreau is writing and producing the project from Walt Disney Studios.\n\nOswald the Lucky Rabbit is very important to the Walt Disney Co. The cartoon, which bears close resemblance to Mickey Mouse, has a fractured history with the company and played a pivotal role in the creation of Disney\u2019s most famous animated character. Oswald was created in 1927 by Walt Disney and featured in 27 animated shorts. But after Universal took control of the character in 1928, Disney created a new character as a replacement: Mickey Mouse.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nBringing Oswald home had been a priority for Disney CEO Bob Iger, and The Walt Disney Co. acquired the trademark in 2006. The character entered the public domain in 2023.\n\nFavreau created, wrote and executive produced The Mandalorian, which aired on Disney+ from 2019-2023. He also has executive produces Disney+ spinoffs The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka and Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. Additionally, Favreau directs and produces the upcoming feature offshoot, Lucasfilm\u2019s The Mandalorian and Grogu, set for release in May 2026.",

Competing against approximately 80 teams from across the U.S., Morgan\u2019s M.O.D. Squad emerged victorious, showcasing their creativity, innovation, and design excellence on a national stage.\n\nThe M.O.D. Squad consisted of four outstanding students:\n\nGeoffrey Moore (B.S. Interior Design, Fall 2024 graduate)\n\n(B.S. Interior Design, Fall 2024 graduate) Ricard Charles (M.Arch, Spring 2024 graduate)\n\n(M.Arch, Spring 2024 graduate) Jesscarly Ramos (B.S. Architecture and Environmental Design, Fall 2024 graduate)\n\n(B.S. Architecture and Environmental Design, Fall 2024 graduate) Catherine Scharbach (B.S. Interior Design, graduating Spring 2025)\n\nGuided by Assistant Professor Howard Mack, who is himself a former 2007 Disney Imagineering competition finalist, the team competed this past fall while most of the members were still enrolled as students. Their achievement reflects Morgan\u2019s commitment to academic excellence and highlights the University\u2019s growing presence in architecture, environmental design, and innovation.\n\nMorgan State University had an impressive showing in this year\u2019s Disney competition. Three teams from Morgan successfully advanced through the early rounds, becoming Quarterfinalists and Semifinalists, with two teams reaching the Top 10 finalists. Ultimately, the M.O.D. Squad claimed the top prize in this celebrated competition.\n\nAs finalists, the team earned an all-expenses-paid trip to Disney\u2019s headquarters in California, where they presented their project to Disney Imagineering executives\u2014the innovative minds behind Disney\u2019s theme parks, resorts, cruise ships, and entertainment venues worldwide.\n\nThe Challenge: Reinventing Urban Transportation with a Disney Twist\n\nThe competition tasked students with reimagining transportation in a major city, incorporating Disney\u2019s signature storytelling, creativity, and immersive guest experiences while ensuring the system was accessible, energy-efficient, and engaging. Artificial intelligence was not allowed, challenging students to develop solutions rooted in design ingenuity and human-centered innovation.\n\nProjects were judged on design mastery, guest experience, cultural awareness, uniqueness, and business impact, as well as the team\u2019s ability to tell a compelling, immersive story\u2014a hallmark of Walt Disney Imagineering.\n\nThe first-place winning M.O.D. Squad\u2019s Oasis Rail project earned them an award and a $1,000 grant for their university. The students were also presented with exclusive job and internship opportunities with Walt Disney Imagineering.\n\nFor nearly thirty years, the Imaginations Competition has been a launching pad for aspiring designers, engineers, and storytellers. Many past winners went on to intern with or work for Walt Disney Imagineering, helping to design and build the Disney experiences that captivate audiences worldwide.\n\nMorgan State University\u2019s continued success in high-profile national competitions, like the Walt Disney Imagineering Imaginations Design Competition, reaffirms its commitment to excellence in architecture, design, and STEM education. By providing students with hands-on learning experiences, industry partnerships, and faculty mentorship, Morgan is cultivating the next generation of innovators who will shape the future of design, urban planning, and immersive storytelling.\n\nCongratulations to the M.O.D. Squad for their outstanding achievement\u2014demonstrating that Morgan Bears don\u2019t just dream big; they design the future!\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Learn more about Morgan\u2019s School of Architecture and Planning: https://www.morgan.edu/sap\n\n*All Photos Courtesy of \u00a9Disney and Photographer Mike Pucher",

            "content": "Disney theme parks have set the standard worldwide for amusement park creativity and quality. Another way Disney sets the standard? Its pricing. Disney tickets are not cheap.\n\nNowadays, a single day ticket to Disneyland or Walt Disney World tops well over a hundred dollars per person. That\u2019s without any fancy add-ons like Park Hopper or Disney Genie+.\n\nAlthough you likely won\u2019t find free Disney tickets (unless you're super lucky), you can do better than simply buying tickets off the official Disney website. Take a look at some of the best ways to buy Disney tickets:\n\n1. Use discounted ticket sites\n\nThere's no shortage of discounted Disney ticket websites willing to sell you tickets. Just make sure you shop with one that's reputable. Here are a couple that NerdWallet recommends:\n\nBuy discount Disney tickets through AAA\n\nAAA, the famous association that offers benefits on everything from hotel stays to restaurants, also sells discounted Disney tickets to members in certain locations.\n\nAAA membership isn\u2019t free, but it can be worth signing up for AAA for the other AAA discounts. Discounts vary by region, so confirm your region does in fact offer discount Disney tickets before signing up.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Active-duty service members and eligible veterans qualify for special rates on Disney tickets that can shave hundreds of dollars off the regular purchase price.\n\nBuy discount Disney tickets through Undercover Tourist\n\nUndercover Tourist is another popular, reputable website offering a cheaper way to buy Disney tickets.\n\nSometimes its discounts can be even more than those AAA offerings. And the real benefit? They\u2019re available to everyone without a membership.\n\nUndercover Tourist also offers deals that cover other theme parks, including Universal Studios discount tickets.\n\n2. Take advantage of Disney's limited-time ticket deals\n\nIf you can be flexible with the day you go to Disney, you can save big. Disney tickets always follow a dynamic pricing model, where tickets on more in-demand days are more expensive than those in the off-season. Generally speaking, you'll pay far more to go to Disneyland on Christmas Day than a random Tuesday in early December.\n\nAnd what's more, Disney sometimes runs its own ticket promotions \u2014 which almost always occur during off-season or shoulder season. Here are the best Disney ticket deals that come straight from Disney:\n\nDisneyland ticket deals\n\nIf you're going to Disneyland with kids...\n\nDisneyland Resort in California is running a limited-time offer for kids. For visits between Jan. 7 and March 20, 2025, kids between ages 3 through 9 can nab one-day, one-park tickets for as low as $50 per child.\n\nIf you're going to Disneyland for multiple days this summer...\n\nIn honor of Disneyland's 70th anniversary, Disney is offering a 3-day, 1-park per day ticket for $120 per day or a 4-day, 1-park per day ticket for $100 per day, valid for visits May 16 through August 14, 2025. You can add Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi Pass for an additional fee. These discounted anniversary tickets go on sale March 11.\n\nIf you're a Southern California resident...\n\nIf you live near Disneyland, you might also qualify to buy discounted theme park tickets for visits before the busy summer season starts again. Right now, Disneyland is offering three-day tickets for customers with eligible Southern California zip codes:\n\nThree-day, one-park-per-day ticket for $199 ($66/day).\n\nThree-day Park Hopper ticket for $289 ($96/day).\n\nThree-day, one-park-per-day ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass for $295 ($98/day).\n\nThree-day, Park Hopper ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass $385 ($128/day).\n\nThat's not bad considering a one-day, one-park Disneyland ticket costs as much as $206 for certain high-demand days. These special tickets for Southern California residents are valid for visits Jan. 1, 2025, through May 15, 2025. The three-day ticket can be used on consecutive days or spread out on separate dates.\n\nIf you'll visit multiple times per year...\n\nConsider purchasing an annual pass (called a Magic Key). These annual passes start at $599, and can be cheaper than buying Park Hopper theme park admission on multiple days throughout the year. It also offers discounts on select parking, dining and merchandise. Be sure to check the blackout dates before you buy. Disneyland Magic Keys go on sale Jan. 22.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Pay with points\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to use points when purchasing your tickets, you\u2019re in a bit of a bind. Currently there is no, say, AmEx discount for Disney tickets. It\u2019s still possible to use your reward points to buy tickets, though it\u2019s not necessarily a great value.\n\nWebsites such as Undercover Tourist allow you to pay with PayPal at checkout. Many card issuers, including Citi, American Express and Chase, have partnered with PayPal in order to redeem your points. The value you\u2019ll receive isn\u2019t great; AmEx points used this way are worth 0.7 cent each, while Chase points can be redeemed at a rate of 0.8 cent per point. Meanwhile, those who hold the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card will receive a value of 1 cent per point.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nIf you hold a credit card with a purchase erasing feature, you can also redeem points for statement credits at a rate of 1 cent each. These include the Bank of America\u00ae Premium Rewards\u00ae credit card, among others.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to purchase theme park tickets with points\n\n4. Buy a vacation package\n\nThis next option won\u2019t have you using points, but it can still save money. Vacation packages bundle options such as theme park tickets, hotels, car rentals and airfare, typically for less than buying a la carte.\n\nCostco Travel requires a membership card (which is its own annual fee), but it offers some of the best Disney vacation packages.\n\nFor example, we found one five-day vacation at a Hilton, including five-day park hopper tickets, for $2,008.56.\n\nWe priced out the cost to book that exact same hotel and tickets separately. It came out to $2,811.53 \u2014 and that didn't include the parking.\n\nIn this case, you\u2019d save more than $800 by bundling your hotel and tickets together into a vacation package. Hilton Honors Disney ticket packages are also available, as are many different retailers offering vacation packages.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Save money on your vacation by using points to book your hotel.\n\nMany vacation packages also code as travel on your card. Maximize points earning by paying with a credit card that earns additional bonus points on travel.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to go to Disney World for cheap\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Use the United MileagePlus X app\n\nThe United MileagePlus X app awards you bonus miles for purchases with hundreds of different retailers, including Disney.\n\nDisney gift cards available through the app will reward you with 3 United miles per dollar spent. You can buy in increments up to $500 and then immediately use those gift cards to buy tickets on the Disney website. Even better, you\u2019ll still earn reward points on the credit card you use to pay, which means you\u2019ll be double-dipping on your earnings.\n\nSure, this isn't a discount upfront, but it makes for an easy way to earn United miles, and potentially rack up additional miles (particular if you spend on a United credit card).\n\nAnd of course, you don't have to limit yourself to just buying Disney tickets. You can also use this trick to buy Disney gift cards that will cover food, souvenirs and other expenses on property.\n\nJust understand that gift cards cannot be exchanged back for cash, so only purchase enough gift cards for what you'll actually spend. And keep in mind that certain retailers on Disney property might not accept Disney gift cards (e.g. third-party retailers on site, or certain vendors that operate in unconventional locations such as balloon vendors).\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to find cheap flights to Disney World\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Buy Target gift cards\n\nHere's a similar trick to the United trick above: use the Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card to buy Disney gift cards. You can buy Disney gift cards at Target using your Target RedCard to get 5% off the purchase price. Yep, the card offers 5% off most Target purchases both in-store and online, and that extends to Disney gift cards.\n\nThis strategy effectively reduces the cost of your Disney tickets (and again, anything else you buy at Disney using those gift cards, like food or souvenirs) by 5%.\n\n7. Get free water park tickets when you book select Walt Disney World hotels\n\nWe said that free Disney tickets were near-impossible to come by, but here's one exception: you can get free Walt Disney World water park tickets (with limitations, of course). Here's the scoop:\n\nGuests who book a qualifying stay at a Disney Resorts Collection hotel for stays with a check-in date anytime in 2025 receive complimentary tickets to either of the two Disney water parks\u2014Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon.\n\nSince Disney water park tickets cost about $80 per person, families or groups who would have purchased water park admission anyway might find this an incredible deal, particularly if they can book at one of the cheapest eligible Disney World hotels.\n\nJust note that this benefit only works on your check-in day, so don't anticipate spending time in the traditional theme parks on that day. Additionally, check-in to your hotel early to maximize the deal's value.\n\n8. Leverage demographics and affiliations\n\nDisney often offers special offers for locals, as well as for people with affiliations such as U.S. military personnel.\n\nFor example, Disney is offering a discount on its 2025 Disney Military Salute Tickets, which are available to active or retired members of the U.S. Military and their spouses, and can be used by themselves, family members and friends.\n\nDisney considers eligible service members as those in the the National Guard, Reservists, the US Coast Guard, the US Space Force, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service (PHS), and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nTricks for finding cheap Disney tickets\n\nThere\u2019s no bones about it: Disney tickets can be expensive. You could consider some cheaper Disney alternatives, but there are also plenty of ways to save on the cost of your vacation.\n\nYou might also consider an annual pass, (which Disneyland refers to as a Magic Key and which Walt Disney World simply refers to as an annual pass), if you visit often.",

Their marriage was, at best, \u201ccomplex,\u201d marked by affairs, an age gap, diminishment, and the death of a child. Alma was a composer in her own right whose career took a back seat at Gustav\u2019s request. At a particularly rocky moment in their relationship, Gustav finally encouraged her to publish Five Songs that are brought to life here by mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke. Next Dudamel leads Mahler\u2019s Fifth Symphony, which progresses from mourning to triumph, inspired in no small part by Gustav meeting and becoming enchanted by Alma. Within the grand gesture is the Adagietto that was intended as a love letter.\n\nConcerts in the Thursday 2 subscription series are generously supported by The Otis Booth Foundation.\n\nThe Mahler Grooves Festival is generously supported by the Frank Gehry Fund for Creativity.\n\nPrograms, artists, dates, prices, and availability subject to change.

We first had to figure out the emotional beats, so we thought about the important lessons the film teaches us about generational healing. Music is a strong part of that. We also wanted to center it around our traditional celebration of Dia de los Muertos. There was a careful planning for what we wanted the experience for the week to be, and we had to decide what would be for night one and what would be for night two.\u201d\n\nFor the second dinner, Miguel reunites with his great-great-grandparents, Hector and Mam\u00e1 Imelda, and transports them to the town square in Santa Cecilia with the help of his magic guitar to celebrate Dia de los Muertos \u2014 the Day of the Dead. Diners are invited to join them as they honor all celebrations, from guests\u2019 birthdays to anniversaries and more.\n\nThe whole family is invited to assemble at Worlds of Marvel, an innovative restaurant that features Super Heroes in a larger-than-life showcase of groundbreaking quantum technology and world-class cuisine.

Heihei Caf\u00e9, inspired by Disney Animation\u2019s Moana, serves coffee, tea, and specialty beverages, as well as themed snacks.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against other top stocks to watch from Jim Cramer\u2019s latest portfolio.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC said that pain is \u201cinevitable\u201d in the stock market as investors go through the volatility infused by the latest tariffs announced by the US government against China, Canada and Mexico. However, Cramer said investors should get used to this volatility and be ready for different situations.\n\n\u201cCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in the last of his myriad interviews of the day that maybe the Canadian and Mexican tariffs could be partially rolled back, perhaps as soon as tomorrow. Yes, it is all that capricious, and you better get used to it if you\u2019re going to own stocks,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Cramer has been talking about recently. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nJim Cramer Is Recommending Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock - Here\u2019s Why\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber Of Hedge Fund Investors: 108\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC recommended investors to buy The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) on the back of strong travel and leisure demand.\n\n\u201cYou need someplace to go, don\u2019t you? I keep hounding you to buy Disney stock because it\u2019s doing so well, yet all people seem to care about is some weak link in the cable business, which I think is going to pick up sooner or later. Anyway, theme parks\u2014yes, they are expensive, but that doesn\u2019t seem to stop people from going.\u201d\n\nDisney reported decent quarterly results last month. Its Direct-to-Consumer streaming segment achieved profitability for the first time in 3Q24 and continued raking in profits in the latest quarter. Disney expects operating income growth of 6-8% for the Experiences segment in FY25.\n\nOverall, DIS ranks 3rd on our list of top stocks to watch from Jim Cramer\u2019s latest portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Disney\u2019s production of Cinderella celebrated its 75th anniversary on Feb. 15, 2025. This timeless film by the Walt Disney Company premiered in Boston and has become a signature aspect in the development of Disney, even 75 years later.\n\nWalt Disney brought many stories of western European folklore to life, such as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Disney decided to bring one specific version of the Cinderella story to life, written by the French author Charles Perrault in 1697, because that version introduced key elements such as the pumpkin-turned-coach, the glass slippers, and the fairy godmother.\n\nThe story of Cinderella follows a girl who is abused by her stepmother and stepsisters. One evening, when her family attends a royal ball, a magical fairy godmother appears and grants Cinderella\u2019s wish to attend the ball, providing her servants, a coach and perfectly fitted glass slippers, with the help of household items and animals turned into beautiful luxuries.\n\nShe encounters Prince Charming, and the two fall in love, but Cinderella has to leave abruptly as her fairy godmother\u2019s gift only lasts until midnight, and the clock is swiftly approaching that time. In her hurry to leave, one of her shoes slips off her foot, leaving the prince with only her shoe as a key to find her.\n\nThe prince then seeks to find this girl. He asked every girl in the area and has them try on the glass slipper. At last, he finds Cinderella in her house, without the glitz and glamour and he reconnects with his true love. Cinderella and Prince Charming live happily ever after, away from her abusive stepfamily.\n\nThis timeless tale saved the Walt Disney Company. The studio was about to reach bankruptcy, and was $4 million in debt due to expenses for Bambi (1942), Pinocchio (1940) and Fantasia (1940). These films were all \u201ccostly flops\u201d as World War II interfered with international audiences\u2019 abilities to watch these American-based productions.\n\nWithout adjusting for inflation, the film has earned over twenty-eight times the amount of Disney\u2019s initial $4 million debt. This not only saved Disney, but allowed them to create their own distribution company \u201cCinderella,\u201d which financed several animated and live-action films alongside the construction of the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, CA.\n\nCinderella\u2019s castle is now a key feature of Walt Disney World in Orlando FL. The castle, which completed construction in 1971, has become the signature introductory imagery for all Walt Disney picture films, home video releases, TV productions, and music group productions, effective 1985.\n\nThis classic landmark was designed to look like the palace from the original movie, alongside additional modern amenities. These include elevators, a VIP hotel suite, the restaurant Cinderella\u2019s Royal Table and the Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boutique.\n\nThe soundtrack was a trailblazer for its time for using double-tracked vocals, as heard on songs such as \u201cSing, Sweet Nightingale.\u201d On top of this, the movie received two academy awards nominations for Best Sound and Best Original Score along with another nomination for Best Original Song with \u201cBibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.\u201d While \u201cBibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\u201d was the only song to be nominated from the Cinderella soundtrack, many of these songs are widely popular, including \u201cA Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes.\u201d\n\nThis Cinderella production was rereleased in theaters six separate times after its initial release, in 1957, 1965, 1973, 1981, 1987 and 2013. Disney has also released two direct-to-video sequels, \u201cCinderella II: Dreams Come True\u201d and \u201cCinderella III: A Twist in Time.\u201d\n\nCinderella\u2019s success in 1950 revitalized Disney, allowing for future growth and preventing financial collapse. Even 75 years later, \u201cCinderella\u201d continues to dazzle audiences with its memorable music, captivating story and everlasting cultural impact, rendering it a timeless classic that remains a fundamental principle of Disney\u2019s legacy.\n\nHelen Burke can be reached at [email protected] or followed on Instagram @helenburke06.",

It produces and distributes content through well-known brands such as Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, National Geographic, and ESPN.\n\nCompanies valued at $200 billion or more are generally considered \u201cmega-cap\u201d stocks, and Walt Disney Solutions fits this criterion perfectly. The company also operates popular direct-to-consumer streaming services, including Disney+ and Hulu, alongside its extensive theme parks and resort experiences worldwide.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nHowever, the entertainment company has fallen 7.7% from its 52-week high of $123.74 , recorded in March last year. Walt Disney shares have declined nearly 2% over the past three months, outperforming the broader Nasdaq Composite's ( $NASX ) 3.7% dip during the same period.\n\nIn the long term, DIS stock has gained 2.5% on a YTD basis, outpacing NASX's 2.9% decrease over the same period. However, Walt Disney has risen nearly 2% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind NASX's 15.2% gain.\n\nYet, DIS has been trading above its 50-day moving average since mid-September last year despite recent fluctuations.\n\nDisney reported fiscal Q1 2025 results on Feb. 5 that beat expectations, with adjusted EPS of $1.76 and revenue of $24.7 billion. The Direct-to-Consumer segment turned profitable for the first time, with Hulu adding 1.6 million subscribers and ESPN\u2019s advertising revenue boosting sports segment operating income to $247 million. Operating income grew 31% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, driven by streaming profitability and a rebound in content licensing, which surged from a loss to $312 million due to successful film releases.\n\nHowever, the stock fell 2.4% on that day due to a 700,000 drop in Disney+ subscribers to 124.6 million and a flat theme park operating income at $3.1 billion, impacted by $120 million in hurricane-related losses. Investors also remained cautious about ongoing challenges in the traditional TV business.\n\nIn contrast, rival Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ) has outperformed Walt Disney. Netflix shares have climbed 59.9% over the past 52 weeks and an 11.1% YTD rise.\n\nDespite DIS' underperformance over the past year, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. Among the 30 analysts covering the stock, there is a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and it is currently trading below the mean price target of $128.92 .\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

These are expansive, quintessentially queer pieces, in which every moment is full of choice. Their profound and personal sounds demand that performers become unabashedly themselves, merging and getting lost in the notes and rhythms, finding themselves again and again, and emerging whole and newly committed to self.

He won these awards, respectively, for \"Water Birds,\" \"The Living Desert,\" \"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Bloom,\" and \"Bear Country.\"\n\nThat year, the film phenom was nominated for six awards for six different films.\n\nBaker's \"Anora\" was nominated for six awards: best picture, best original screenplay, best director, best editing, best actress (Mikey Madison) and best supporting actor (Yura Borisov).\n\nBaker edits, directs and writes most of his films and has also served as producer and cinematographer for some. Wearing all of these hats paid off and led him to make history at the Oscars.\n\nThe film \u2014 which is about a young sex worker from New York who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, before his parents find out and put her Cinderella story in jeopardy \u2014 took home five out of the six awards it was nominated for. The only one not nabbed was best supporting actor, which went to Kieran Culkin for \"A Real Pain.\"\n\nAs the writer, editor and director of \"Anora,\" Baker himself won four Oscars for the film, setting a record for most Oscars won by one person for a single film. Mikey Madison took home the fifth with her best actress win.\n\nIn his remarks on stage after winning the Oscar for best editing, Baker said only three individuals are allowed in the editing room with him.\n\n\"Those three people are Samantha Quan, my wife and producer, Alex Coco, my incredible fellow producer, and my dog, Bunson, he gave me some pretty good notes,\" Baker joked.\n\nThis is the first year Baker himself has been nominated by the Academy. In 2018, Willem Defoe, who starred in Baker's \"The Florida Project,\" earned a best supporting actor nomination.\n\nBaker, whose wife, Samathan Quan, co-produced \"Anora,\" revealed to NPR that he had a $6 million budget for the independent film, distributed by Neon. The film only took 40 days to film, with 10 days of shooting going to one infamous scene inside a mansion in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, according to director of photography Drew Daniels.\n\nThe film went on to gross more than $40 million worldwide and also won the Palme d'Or \u2014 the highest award for directors of feature films \u2014 at the Cannes Film Festival, plus two BAFTAs and a Critics Choice Award.\n\nDuring his acceptance speech for best director, Baker encouraged audiences to go back to movie theaters to see films, saying \"the theater-going experience is under threat.\"\n\n\"Watching a film in a theater with an audience is an experience. We can laugh together, cry together. And in a time in which our world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever: It's a communal experience you simply don't get at home,\" he said.\n\nDuring his acceptance speech for best original screenplay, he thanked the sex worker community, as the main character in \"Anora\" works in a strip club and is hired as an escort. \"They have shared their stories. They have shared life experiences with me over the years. My deepest respect. Thank you. I share this with you,\" he said.",

            "content": "Walt Disney Animation Studios has officially pulled the plug on its Tiana princess series as it abandons making original longform content for streaming, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed there will be some layoffs in its Vancouver studio as a result of this shift in business strategy. In addition to the Tiana series, the studio is also scrapping an unannounced feature-length project that was set to go straight to Disney+.\n\nTiana was first announced in December 2020, and was envisioned as a musical featuring Anika Noni Rose reprising her role as Tiana from the 2009 film The Princess and the Frog, the film centering on Disney\u2019s first Black princess.\n\nSources close to the streaming series say that despite best efforts, including several changes to the creative team, Tiana ultimately could not get to where it needed to be given production costs.\n\nStill, The Princess and the Frog remains a key property for the company, as Tiana is one of Disney\u2019s canon princesses. Last year, the Splash Mountain attraction was revamped at both of Disney\u2019s U.S. parks and transformed into Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure.\n\nThe animation studio is said to developing a separate shortform special inspired by The Princess and the Frog, which is currently in early development. Though details of the project remain under wraps, it\u2019s expected to feature all-new storytelling based on the 2009 film with Joyce Sherri attached as director and writer, and Steve Anderson also directing.\n\nThe decision to shelve Tiana and the unannounced Disney+ movie follows last year\u2019s news that Pixar would no longer prioritize developing longform episodic content after the release of Dream Productions and Win or Lose on Disney+.\n\nDuring the pandemic, some Disney execs \u2014 including then-CEO Bob Chapek \u2014 pressed its various film silos to make original content for Disney+ in order to grow subscribers.\n\nWalt Disney Animation\u2019s Moana 2 was originally conceived as an animated series before being reimagined as a theatrical release. The decision that paid off in spades and led to a $1 billion-plus run at the global box office. It debuts March 12 on Disney+, where it\u2019s also expected to generate huge numbers (the first Moana, released in 2016, became a cult classic with kids and was the most watched streaming movie in 2024, according to Nielsen). That, alongside with the $1.7 billion earned by Pixar\u2019s Inside Out 2 \u2014 the biggest movie of 2024 \u2014 proved that theatrical is its animation\u2019s greatest strength.\n\nInsiders say that Walt Disney Animation remains committed to releasing one theatrical film per year in addition to other shorts and special projects. Zootopia 2 is slated for release on Nov. 26 with the studio\u2019s new chief creative officer, Jared Bush, tapped to direct and write, with Disney vet Byron Howard also directing. An unannounced feature is scheduled for November 2026, while the third installment in the blockbuster Frozen franchise is set for November 2027.\n\nShortform is wildly popular on streaming. Bluey, which Disney+ licenses, was the most watched show in the U.S. last year, according Nielsen. Disney Animation\u2019s past shortform streaming projects include the Emmy-award winning Zootopia+ and Baymax! series.",

His oversee also includes the Cinema Partnerships team, non-theatrical sales and the iconic El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cAndrew is one of the most highly respected distribution executives in the industry with a deep understanding of the evolving marketplace and a passion for bringing films to audiences around the world,\u201d said Taff. \u201cHaving known him for several years, I\u2019m thrilled he\u2019s joining our team and have no doubt that his strategic vision and many years of expertise will be invaluable as we continue to deliver exceptional storytelling experiences on the big screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely thrilled to be joining Alan Bergman, Cathleen Taff, and the entire team at The Walt Disney Studios,\u201d said Cripps. \u201cThe work they\u2019ve accomplished year-after-year is nothing short of inspiring, and I\u2019m excited for the opportunity to contribute to that incredible momentum and help build for the future.\u201d\n\nReporting into Cripps are Jeffrey Forman, SVP, International Theatrical Sales and Matthew Kalavsky, SVP, General Sales Manager, Domestic Theatrical Distribution.\n\nAdditionally, with his global oversight, regional studio distribution leaders \u2013 including Nick Rush, SVP, Studio Distribution for EMEA, Martin Iraola, SVP & Managing Director Southern and GM Theatrical for LATAM, and John Hsu, Head of Distribution & Operations in APAC \u2013 will also file into Cripps while maintaining reporting lines to their respective regional leaders.\n\nCripps had been at Warner Bros. as President of International Theatrical Distribution since September 2019, where he rallied the studio to their biggest grossing global hit ever in Barbie ($1.44B). He also oversaw the second biggest R-rated movie at the box office of all-time, 2019\u2019s Joker which minted $1.07 billion as well as the Dune franchise ($1.1 billion). While at Warners, Cripps was also responsible for the foreign release of such MGM titles like Red One and Saltburn.\n\nPrior to Warner Bros, Cripps was the President of International Theatrical Distribution for 20th Century Fox pre-merger, where he worked on Bohemian Rhapsody, and was the London-based president of International for IMAX and executive vice-president of the IMAX Corporation from 2012-17.

In the end, no movie had a bigger spotlight than Anora.\n\nA dark romantic drama about a New York sex worker who elopes with the son of a Russian oligarch, Anora claimed the most awards of any movie on Sunday with five, including the coveted Best Picture honor. Breakout star Mikey Madison, 25, won her first Oscar for Best Actress in the titular role, while director Sean Baker made his own impressive history with multiple awards (more on that in a bit).\n\nElsewhere, Adrien Brody won his second Best Actor trophy for The Brutalist, while A Real Pain\u2019s Kieran Culkin and Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019s Zoe Salda\u00f1a completed their awards season sweeps with victories in the Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress categories, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUp and down the ballot, 2025 Academy Award winners made history with their accomplishments. Here\u2019s a look at some of the biggest feats from the ceremony.\n\n\n\nSean Baker tied a record held by Walt Disney\n\nAlong with Madison, Anora director Baker solidified his star status with the night\u2019s biggest award haul. The 54-year-old\u2014who also wrote, edited, and co-produced the movie\u2014won the statuettes for Best Director, Original Screenplay, Film Editing, and Best Picture.\n\nBaker and Walt Disney are the only two people to win four individual Oscars in one year. However, Baker has the historic distinction of receiving those four Oscars all for the same movie. Disney\u2019s four wins in 1954 were the result of four different projects: Best Documentary Feature for The Living Desert; Best Documentary\u2014Short Subject for The Alaskan Eskimo; Best Short Subject\u2014Cartoon with Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom; and Best Short Subject\u2014Two-Reel thanks to Bear Country.\n\nFamed director Francis Ford Coppola previously won three awards in one night for his work on The Godfather: Part II (1974). Bong Joon Ho accepted four awards for Parasite in 2020, but the movie\u2019s win for Best International Feature Film went to South Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaker, previously known for the 2017 movie The Florida Project starring Willem Dafoe, entered this year\u2019s ceremony as a first-time nominee. He was poignant during his acceptance speech for Original Screenplay, thanking members of the sex worker community for sharing their stories and inspiring Anora. But later, he also poked fun at his own work after winning for Best Editing. \u201cI truly appreciate the recognition for this because, God, if you saw that footage, I saved this film in the edit. Trust me. That director should never work again,\u201d he said.\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a celebrated her Dominican heritage\n\nGetty Images\n\nZoe Salda\u00f1a gave one of the most emotional speeches of the night while accepting her Best Supporting Actress award for Emilia P\u00e9rez. The 46-year-old became the first American actor of Dominican origin to win an Oscar.\n\nSalda\u00f1a held back tears as she offered praise to her fellow nominees and thanked members of her family for their support. \u201cI am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hard-working hands,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that I am getting an award for a role where I got to sing and speak in Spanish, my grandmother if she were here she would be so delighted. This is for my grandmother!\u201d\n\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, the Netflix crime musical also starring Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Selena Gomez, won just two of the 13 Oscar categories it competed in. Cl\u00e9ment Ducol, Camille, and Jacques Audiard won Best Original Song for \u201cEl Mal,\u201d which heavily features Salda\u00f1a.\n\nWicked\u2019s Paul Tazewell won a historic costuming Oscar\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe big screen adaptation of Broadway smash Wicked factored heavily into Sunday night\u2019s ceremony. Stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, who were both nominated for 2025 awards, opened the show with a medley of songs celebrating the movie and the city of Los Angeles. Wicked ultimately won two awards: Best Production Design and Best Costume Design.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latter marks the first Oscar for Paul Tazewell, who simultaneously became the first Black man to win in the category. The 60-year-old was previously nominated for Costume Design from the Steven Spielberg musical West Wide Story (2021). Tazewell also tackled costuming for the 2019 historical drama Harriet about famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman.\n\n\u201cMy Ozzian muses, Cynthia and Ariana, I love you so much. All the other cast, thank you, thank you, thank you for trusting me with bringing your characters to life. This is everything,\u201d Tazewell said in his acceptance speech.\n\nFlow makes history for Latvia\n\nFollowing its Golden Globe and Producers Guild of America wins, the animated animal adventure Flow took home the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. The movie is the first project from Latvia to win an Academy Award.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFlow, directed by Gints Zilbalodis, only cost a reported $3.7 million to produce\u2014making it a theoretical underdog against big-budget hits The Wild Robot (from DreamWorks) and Inside Out 2 (Disney and Pixar). The movie was made with Blender, a free open-source editing software.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAny kid now has tools that are used to make these now\u2013Academy Award winning films, so I think we\u2019re going to see all kinds of exciting films being made from kids who might not have had a chance to do this before,\u201d Zilbalodis said during a press conference after the ceremony.\n\nFlow was also nominated for Best International Feature but lost out to I\u2019m Still Here. The historical drama gave Brazil its first win in that category.\n\nYou Might Also Like",

As a result, the \"Tiana\" animated series, which has been in development for half a decade, has been canceled. The show would have seen Anika Noni Rose reprise her role from 2009's \"The Princess and the Frog.\"\n\nThe change in mission isn't exactly shocking. It's widely known that Disney+ has struggled to make the money work on high-budget streaming originals, from live-action \"Star Wars\" shows to animated projects from Pixar. \"Moana 2,\" in particular, was infamously meant to be a Disney+ series before it evolved into a theatrical film \u2014 and given that movie's billon-dollar gross, coupled with the massive box office success of Pixar's \"Inside Out 2,\" it makes sense that Disney would want to reallocate its animation resources to more traditional release models.\n\nThat said, it's hard not to see the \"Tiana\" cancellation as part and parcel of Disney's recent efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives company-wide. When the longstanding Disney theme park ride Splash Mountain was remodeled last year as a \"Princess and the Frog\" tie-in, forgoing its previous affiliation with the controversial \"Song of the South,\" there was some major racist backlash online \u2014 something Disney has faced repeatedly for various reasons of late and, in the case of shows like \"Star Wars: The Acolyte,\" struggled to strike back at. The recent Pixar streaming series \"Win or Lose\" similarly made headlines for cutting a planned transgender storyline, a move that some critics have called a capitulation to current cultural and political trends.",

He\u2019s the third director to win the editing award and the first as a solo editor.\n\nAnd more than 70 years ago, in 1954, Disney won in four separate categories, for Best Documentary Feature, Best Documentary (Short Subject), Best Short Subject (Cartoon) and Best Short Subject (Two Reel).\n\nIn 2020, Bong Joon-ho accepted four Oscars for \u201cParasite\u201d \u2013 winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature. But the international prize is awarded to the nation, not the individual filmmaker, and thus does not count as one of his personal Oscar wins.\n\nLike \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cAnora\u201d also won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The two film, both released by Neon, are among the four films to have done the Palme d\u2019Or/Best Picture double win, along with \u201cMarty\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnora\u201d is the eighth feature by the 54-year-old Baker, long a beloved figure on the independent film scene for his live-wire human comedies like \u201cTangerine\u201d and \u201cRed Rocket.\u201d His 2017 \u201cThe Florida Project \u2013 that\u2019s the one set just outside Disney World in Orlando \u2013 was the only previous Baker movie to garner Oscar attention, receiving a single nomination for Willem Dafoe\u2019s performance.",

            "content": "Back in 2016, Anora filmmaker Sean Baker secretly shot portions of his breakout movie The Florida Project within the tightly guarded walls of Disney World. Nearly a decade later, he bested the House of Mouse with four wins at Oscars 2025, joining Walt Disney for holding the record for most Academy Awards won in a single night.\n\n\u201cThis is my battle cry: Filmmakers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will,\u201d the 54-year-old writer-director said from the Dolby Theatre stage. He ascended to the podium four times at the 2025 Oscars, winning for producing, directing, editing, and writing the original screenplay for the best picture of the year. He had been predicted to win most of these awards. But his star, Mikey Madison, pulled off a major upset over Demi Moore in the best actress race to boot. With his sweep, Baker becomes only the second person to win four Oscars in the same night and the first person to win four Oscars for a single film.\n\nIn the past decade, four filmmakers have won three statues in a single evening. Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019s Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert swept the 2023 Oscars with awards for producing, directing, and writing the original screenplay for that year\u2019s best picture. This same triple crown was achieved by Parasite\u2019s Bong Joon-ho (with the film also winning best international feature) and Birdman\u2019s Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in 2020 and 2015, respectively.\n\nBut until now, Walt Disney was the only person to achieve more than a trifecta. Back in 1954, Disney won four competitive Oscars across four separate projects\u2014best documentary feature (The Living Desert), best documentary short subject (The Alaskan Eskimo), best cartoon short subject (Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom), and best two-reel short subject (Bear Country). Upon accepting his fourth award of the night, Disney joked from the stage, \u201cI\u2019ve just gotta say one more word. It\u2019s wonderful\u2014but I think this is my year to retire.\u201d\n\nBaker, who became a first-time Oscar nominee with Anora, made no such assurances in his acceptance speeches. After winning the Academy Award for best director, Baker thanked presenter Quentin Tarantino for casting leading lady Mikey Madison in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, for without that move, \u201cthere would be no Anora.\u201d He later thanked his mother, who \u201cintroduced me to cinema at five years old\u201d and was also celebrating her birthday. \u201cHappy birthday, mom, I love you,\u201d Baker said onstage.\n\nFirework content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhile accepting the award for best editing, Baker had some fun regarding his dual roles as director and editor. \u201cI truly appreciate the recognition for this, but God if you saw that footage, I saved this film in the edit, trust me,\u201d he quipped. \u201cThat director should never work again.\u201d The filmmaker went on to refer to editing as \u201chalf of my directing and a third of my screenwriting.\u201d As for the three people he allows into the editing room? His wife, fellow Anora producer Samantha Quan, fellow producer Alex Coco, and his dog, Bunson. \u201cHe gave me some pretty good notes.\u201d\n\nAnora, which earned six nods in the 2025 Oscar nominations, stars Madison as Ani, a Brooklyn sex worker who falls for a Russian oligarch\u2019s son (Mark Eydelshteyn), then sees her fairy tale fade away with the arrival of a henchman with a heart of gold (Yura Borisov). \u201cI want to thank the sex worker community,\u201d Baker said during his first speech of the night, for best original screenplay, offering members of that contingent his \u201cdeepest respect\u201d for sharing their stories.\n\nFirework content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAfter winning the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, the $6 million film has been living out a Cinderella tale that somewhat mimics the movie itself. Anora swept the DGAs, PGAs, and Critics Choice Awards in recent weeks, before dominating at the Independent Spirit Awards. Not even a late-stage rush from Conclave, which earned top honors at the BAFTA and the SAG Awards, could halt the momentum. As his film won best picture, Baker delivered the night\u2019s closing refrain: \u201cLong live independent film!\u201d",

However, Baker did set a record by becoming the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.\n\nAnora was nominated for six total awards this year, and Baker himself took home statuettes for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Director and Best Picture; he wrote, directed, edited and produced the movie.

Who played Alice in \"Alice in Wonderland?\" Or Prince Philip in \"Sleeping Beauty?\" Who wrote \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians?\"\n\nSome readers may have been able to recall that famed children's book author Bill Peet wrote \"Dalmatians,\" and other hardcore Disney Nerds might know that famed child star Bobby Driscoll played Peter Pan, but many of the actual filmmakers of early Disney-released animated features have remained obscure. One would have to look up that Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske served as the supervising directors of \"Cinderella,\" and that they also helmed \"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"Peter Pan,\" and \"Lady and the Tramp.\" Heck, they should be better known, as \"Cinderella\" kind of saved the company.\n\nThese people are, of course, all celebrities in the animation world, but to the general public, they are esoteric figures. This is largely because the Disney corporation \u2014 and Walt Disney in particular \u2014 was insistent on an overwhelming amount of company branding. \"Cinderella\" wasn't a Geromini/Jackson/Luske film, but a Disney film. To this day, most of the company's animated films are seen as \"the Disney version\" in conversation, rather than credited to their directors and writers. It wouldn't be until the 1990s that cineastes would win out, and the directors of certain Disney-manufactured animated films became better known.\n\nDisney branding is also the main reason that voice actress Adriana Castelotti had trouble finding work after playing the title character in David Hand's 1937 feature \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" According to a 1993 report in the newspaper The Day, Castelotti, then 77, admitted she wasn't credited for her \"Snow White\" work as \u2014 as Walt Disney put it \u2014 he didn't want to \"spoil the illusion.\"",

Demand for the superstar pianists\u2019 recital was such that Wednesday\u2019s sold-out performance led the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which presented the concert, to add a second date. Not a concert to be missed by any living being who could be squeezed in, the Wednesday night performance had one patron exiting Disney carrying a small dog.\n\nTwo-piano teams tend to be for the like-minded. Pianists typically sit facing each other, so their eyes can meet, the pianos nestled together and the lid up on the rear instrument, creating in effect a double instrument of around 460 strings. Such rapport frequently leads to sibling duos (like the Lab\u00e8que sisters) or husband-wife teams (like Dennis Russell Davies and Maki Namekawa).\n\nLittle of that, however, applies to the unlikely \u00d3lafsson and Wang pairing. The introspective Islandic and dynamic Chinese Canadian pianists sat side by side at Disney, their pianos facing opposite directions, their heads turning to make eye contact only when needing to coordinate a climax. Keeping to type, \u00d3lafsson chose the L.A. Phil\u2019s old-school luminous Hamburg Steinway; Wang, the orchestra\u2019s more glamorous New York Steinway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoices Commentary: How exuberant, ambitious operas in L.A. score big despite small casts and modest budgets Los Angeles is in the midst of a de facto chamber opera festival with productions across the region tackling the social and political issues of the moment.\n\nThe acoustic result proved an immersive glory in Disney while still allowing for transparency and individuality of both the pianos and the pianists. \u00d3lafsson\u2019s full, liquid tone, particularly in the lower registers of the Hamburg keyboard, provided a rich, pillowy foundation for the sound, while Wang\u2019s treble sparkled. Small quiet pieces became piano magic. Flashy big works offered massive piano immersion to a fault.\n\nThrilling \u2014 but also curious. The program included a little bit of everything, and the littler the bits, the better. To begin, the stylish pianists walked quietly on stage, sat down and instantly floated off into fanciful space with Luciano Berio\u2019s two-minute \u201cWasserklavier.\u201d Fingers barely graced keys in an evocation of the calmly rippling watery surface.\n\nConcerts rarely begin well when they begin in stillness, but somehow the pianists instantly stunned an antsy audience into silence (no unwrapping candies, no dog barking). This flowed into the rhapsodic lyricism of late Schubert, his substantial Fantasia in F Minor. Wang conveyed a brightly percussive melodic delicacy, while \u00d3lafsson answered with suave lyricism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Cage\u2019s short, Satie-esque \u201cExperiences 1\u201d and Conlon Nancarrow\u2019s tango-like Study No. 6, originally for player piano, then introduced John Adams\u2019 \u201cHallelujah Junction.\u201d To hear these in Disney had special significance for the venue. Written for two L.A. pianists, Gloria Cheng and Grant Gershon, \u201cHallelujah Junction\u201d had its premiere in 1998 at the then-new Getty Center and was dedicated to Ernest Fleischmann. Without that imperious head of the L.A. Phil, who never took no for an answer, there would have no Disney Hall in which to produce the evening\u2019s incomparable piano aura. It was Fleischmann who began Adams\u2019 four-decade relationship with the L.A. Phil, something that the composer acknowledged at the orchestra\u2019s latest Green Umbrella concert, dedicating it to Fleischmann in honor of what would have been his 100th birthday this past December.\n\n\u00d3lafsson and Wang captured subtle Cagean whimsy more readily than seductive Nancarrow shimmer before they went to town with \u201cHallelujah Junction.\u201d Both pianists have a history with Adams. He wrote his glorious, grinding second piano concerto, \u201cMust the Devil Have All the Great Tunes,\u201d for Wang and his mellower third piano concerto, \u201cAfter the Fall,\u201d for \u00d3lafsson, who premiered it with the San Francisco Symphony last month. But for all that, the pair barreled through \u201cHallelujah Junction.\u201d They lacked the clarity and nuance of Cheng and Gershon, but Wang\u2019s exhilarated rhythmic grooves had lives of their own.\n\nReview Twyla Tharp at her best in \u2018Aguas da Amazonia\u2019 premiere with Philip Glass score Celebrating its 60th anniversary, Twyla Tharp Dance premieres \u2018Aguas da Amazonia\u2019 with Philip Glass\u2019 score in Santa Barbara, Costa Mesa, Palm Desert and Northridge before it heads for the Kennedy Center.\n\nMagic returned with Arvo P\u00e4rt\u2019s \u201cHymn to a Great City\u201d in the second half. Presumably written for and premiered in New York in 1984, this tiny score takes no bites from the Big Apple. No car horns for the mystical P\u00e4rt, who didn\u2019t make his U.S. debut for another two years (at the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music outside of Santa Cruz). But prayer bells galore. Still, P\u00e4rt didn\u2019t like what he heard and withdrew the hymn, only to revise it years later. As it now exists, it captures the supernatural tingle of little bells, as well as the heart-throb of gongs, all sounding off in the misty distance. Here the pianists pulled off a feat of witchery, as P\u00e4rt once did himself writing his Fourth Symphony (\u201cLos Angeles\u201d) for the L.A. Phil and Disney acoustic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00d3lafsson and Wang went on to bring out the darker bell-like qualities of the two-piano version of Rachmaninoff\u2019s Symphonic Dances. Even so, the gloom of Rachmaninoff\u2019s final major work was dispensed by pure pianistic spectacle. The couple finally danced their way out of Disney with three encores. A Dvor\u00e1k Slavonic dance and a Brahms Hungarian one were flirtatious and fun. Brahms\u2019 Waltz in A-flat Major was lovingly exquisite.\n\nBut what might we have missed without that lucky pooch\u2019s ability to hear higher frequencies of the ethereal bell tones? Even to limited human ears, they linger long.",

            "content": "Much has been said about production moving away from California and even out of the country over the last few years. Many put it on rising costs and contraction related to streaming overtaking broadcast and cable, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2023 strikes, but one of the biggest problems is the lack of tax benefits productions in California are given, particularly in Los Angeles, the supposed entertainment hub of the world. As of now, the state caps its film tax credit program at $330 million annually. Compared to Georgia, which has no cap and spent more than $1 billion in 2024 subsidizing production, or New York, which offers $700 million in tax breaks annually, California\u2019s financial incentives are paltry at best.\n\nHowever, Governor Newsom is working to change that. In October 2024, the Democrat announced he and others, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, would be pushing to more than double the current allotment, bringing the cap up to $750 million a year. At the time, he described the lack of California production as a \u201clegitimate crisis\u201d and implored an action that was \u201cmeaningful, not just intentional.\u201d Despite the appeal, in the aftermath of the Southern California wildfires and the money that will need to be spent rebuilding, legislators in Sacramento may need further convincing as to why such a huge block of funds should be put aside for the arts.\n\nLeading this effort, the Entertainment Union Coalition \u2014 made up of the WGAW, DGA, SAG-AFTRA, Teamster Local 399, AFM, California IATSE Council, and LIUNA Local 724 \u2014 announced the launch of the \u201cKeep California Rolling\u201d campaign this past Thursday, February 27. Their intention is to both gather support for protecting, preserving, and creating jobs in the film and television industry across all of California and to educate new legislators, budget committee members, and other elected officials to guarantee they vote for the increase in the 2025-2026 budget that\u2019ll be approved this summer.\n\nBeginning this upcoming week, the EUC will commence its lobbying efforts, but it\u2019s not the only group trying to shine a light on this cause. Julie Plec, co-creator of \u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d and \u201cThe Girls on the Bus,\u201d and Sarah Adina Smith, an indie filmmaker and one of the directors on HBO\u2019s upcoming \u201cKnight of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d have come together to draft the \u201cStay in L.A.\u201d petition on January 23. Their proposal is to call for \u201cemergency measures\u201d to be taken in combatting California production stagnation and (per The Hollywood Reporter) have put together a list of steps individuals can take to promote this initiative. They read as follows:\n\n1. Support Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s $750 million budget cap raise on the incentive and urge him to temporarily uncap the incentive for three years in L.A. County as part of efforts to rebuild after the fires.\n\n2. Educate legislators in Sacramento that a more competitive incentive is about job creation and isn\u2019t simply a \u201ccorporate handout.\u201d As of August, the unemployment rate in the film and TV sector reached 12.5 percent, marking the industry\u2019s highest August unemployment rate since at least 2000, excluding the pandemic period. This rate is nearly triple the national average.\n\n3. Raise the tax incentive amount to 30 percent for both films and television shows. This number is the bare minimum to make California competitive. Offer an additional 5 percent for any film below $10 million to encourage more independent films to shoot in California.\n\n4. Support a bill funding postproduction that is not contingent upon shooting in state. New York has this, the U.K. has this \u2026 and it\u2019s why their postproduction businesses are booming and L.A.\u2019s is hurting. The postproduction carve-out should include music for film and TV scores, too.\n\n5. Consider a new bill targeting commercial and music video production, which has also plummeted. Shortform production is how many cast and crewmembers make ends meet between TV or film gigs.\n\n6. Lift restrictions on shooting outside and in public spaces in L.A. (emulating NYC\u2019s successful program) and offer a temporary reduction in permit fees in conjunction with loosening up notification requirements to reduce FilmLA\u2019s staffing costs.\n\n7. Neighborhood councils can create film-friendly corridors and residential zones. The county can offer discounted property taxes for all who participate.\n\n8. The city and county can offer unused or underused property as free \u201cbase camps\u201d for production. Create an easy-to-use map of all these areas.\n\n9. Waive or defer L.A. city tax on productions and consider a city ordinance temporarily capping location fees to combat price gouging and to make it easier for productions to afford to shoot.\n\n10. Perhaps most crucially, studios and streamers must do their part by pledging to shoot more in L.A. County, demonstrating a commitment to rebuilding after the fires.\n\nTo sign Plec and Smith\u2019s \u201cStay in L.A.\u201d petition and learn more, click here.\n\nTo learn more about the \u201cKeep California Rolling\u201d campaign and how you can help, click here.",

J. Afterwards, the names of the entire Class of 2023 were displayed on a Times Square billboard.\n\nRowland, the four-time Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, actress and television executive producer, served last year as the program\u2019s ambassador and as an advocate for the students. She shared personal insights, drawing from her own unique experience as a pre-teen performer, then as a teenager in one of the best-selling female groups of all time, Destiny\u2019s Child.\n\nThe Disney Dreamers program is an important part of Disney\u2019s commitment to support diverse communities. By encouraging the next generation to think big, Disney hopes the students will carry what they learn back home and continue pursuing their dreams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to welcome another outstanding group of teens from across the country for our 16th year!\u201d said Tracey Powell, Disney Signature Experiences vice president and Disney Dreamers Academy executive champion. \u201cThey are going to have the experience of a lifetime, setting them on a journey to go out and achieve their dreams, just like the classes who came before them.\u201d\n\nSince 2008, Disney Dreamers Academy has inspired more than 1,500 students from across the country by fueling their dreams and showing them a world of possibilities as they prepare for their futures. In the years following, graduates have become storytellers, artists, engineers, innovators, journalists and more, and have transitioned into mentors to the Disney Dreamers who follow them.\n\nEach year, the Disney Dreamers are selected from thousands of applicants who answer essay questions about their personal stories and dreams for the future.

            "content": "\"Walt Disney World\" and \"scandal\" are two topics that don\u2019t often go together. Disney World and long lines? Of course. Disney World and churros? Absolutely. But that term above doesn't crop up much for the park And yet, about five years ago, the biggest story in the theme park world, which CinemaBlend covered extensively at the time, was about a string of thefts at the most magical place on earth and a still missing-in-action audio-animatronic. With that, CB recently spoke to the director of a new doc about the wild tale.\n\nStolen Kingdom is a new documentary film that explores the trend of urban exploring at closed parts of Walt Disney World, and its connection to the black market for all things Disney. This includes the case of Patrick Spikes, a YouTuber who stole and sold the clothes belonging to the audio-animatronic known as Buzzy from the defunct Cranium Command attraction.\n\nWhat makes the story even crazier, however, is that at some point after Buzzy\u2019s clothes were stolen, Buzzy himself disappeared. Since then, the exact whereabouts of Buzzy have been unknown. Stolen Kingdom does not have any \u201csmoking gun\u201d regarding Buzzy\u2019s whereabouts so, when I recently had the chance to chat with the film\u2019s director, Joshua Bailey, I asked him, having now spoken to many people potentially involved, what he thought had happened to Buzzy. Bailey's answer was quite honest\u2026\n\nI confidently don't know. I think there's two great possibilities, and one of them might be impossible, and it's that maybe it was a misunderstanding and that Disney does have him, it would require them to come out and admit this, and I don't know if that'll ever happen. I guess I lean a little towards that he was stolen. But if he was stolen, I genuinely do not know where he could be at this point. He could be anywhere.\n\nPatrick Spikes, while admitting to stealing Buzzy\u2019s clothes, which he sold to NBA star and noted Disney fan Robin Lopez, has continued to claim that he did not steal Buzzy. Stolen Kingdom indicates that Spikes may have been offered money for Buzzy at some point but, even if that\u2019s the case, it only proves there was somebody who wanted Buzzy, who may have been just as willing to pay somebody else to get what they wanted.\n\nBut, as Bailey says here, it\u2019s also at least possible that Buzzy isn\u2019t missing at all. It\u2019s possible that, following the theft of the clothes, in order to prevent the animatronic from being stolen, Disney simply removed it from its location in the closed Disney World attraction.\n\nDespite that, though, there are still questions. If Disney World removed Buzzy, fans don\u2019t know what state the audio-animatronic is in. He might have been taken down in one piece and put in a corner of Walt Disney Imagineering\u2019s warehouse, where things sometimes get lost for decades. The character may, however, as Joshua Bailey suggests, have been destroyed as part of the removal. Bailey told me\u2026\n\nAn unfortunate theory that I think some of us have considered is that he was sort of taken apart because of everything that happened, or hopefully, he was just, you know, locked away In a storage unit somewhere, just so he's been hiding. But, yeah, I'd lean a little towards that he was, in fact, stolen.\n\nIf Buzzy was stolen at the behest of a private collector, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll ever know. Perhaps Buzzy could turn up years from now, but the animatronic's fate just may become an unsolvable theme park mystery.",

The central plaza faces Orange Avenue, flanked by the Grand Bohemian Hotel on one side, and Lake Lucerne on the other.\n\nYou'll immediately see why it is a beloved venue.\n\nIt's easily accessible from both I-4 and the 408 and located within walking distance of several downtown bars and restaurants. The remarkable architecture of DPAC makes it an icon within Downtown Orlando.\n\nDr. Phillips Center Downtown Orlando | Image credit: Beth Bell\n\nParking Options for Dr. Phillips Center\n\nBefore your date night at DPAC, be sure to read over the Parking and Transportation Options.\n\nThe Dr. Phillips Performing Arts Center offers event parking at the City Commons Parking Garage and, for select shows, the Seaside Plaza Parking Garage. Curbside valet parking services are also available on Magnolia Avenue. Parking can be reserved online alongside theater tickets, or purchased separately up to 24 hours in advance through the Bill and Mary Darden Box Office. Same-day parking is also available at a slightly higher rate.

You can also valet park here for 3 hours or more regardless if you dine there. In most cases, you\u2019ll need more than three hours to see a show.\n\nValet Parking is also available at Kres Chophouse, which is an excellent choice to stop in before or after the show. The wait for valet parking here is far less than at Dr. Phillips Center.\n\nBosendorfer Lounge at Grand Bohemian Hotel Orlando 2023 \u2013 Dani Meyering\n\nInside the Theaters\u2026\n\nAs you set foot inside the Dr. Phillips Center the staff will scan your ticket and direct you to one of the four theaters.\n\nDr. Phillips Performing Arts Center is a major entertainment complex with four floors and three theaters:\n\nState-of-the-art Steinmetz Hall for many Orlando Ballet performances and Orlando Philharmonic concerts\n\nfor many Orlando Ballet performances and Orlando Philharmonic concerts Broadway shows, comedy shows, and big concerts are typically hosted inside the Walt Disney Theater\n\nBallets and other dances, concerts, comedians, and more are typically hosted in the Alexis & Jim Pugh Theater.\n\nSteinmetz Hall is one of the most \u201cacoustically perfect\u201d spaces in the world, making it the best place to soak up grand orchestral and choral acts.\n\nRestrooms are located near each theater. Seating is comfortable, although some seats can be a little tight and close together. But since we're talking date night, we don't mind cuddling up a little closer.\n\nDr. Phillips Center Walt Disney Theater Entrance | Image credit: Beth Bell\n\nDr. Phillips Center Food and Beverage\n\nIf you don't have time to go out to eat before the show, feel free to grab drinks and prepackaged snacks from one of the multiple theater bars. Snacks like cookies, trail mix, gummi bears, and chocolate-covered pretzels are available at each theater bar.\n\nThere is a bar on every floor, making it easy to snag a glass of wine or a cocktail before the show or during intermission. Most people crowded the large bar on the first floor, and overlook the bars on the second and third floor.\n\nImportant tip: Plan on arriving about 45 to 60 minutes before the show starts so you're not stressed and don't miss the start of the show. An Orlando theater date night is a special occasion and an amazing experience that should not be rushed.\n\nThe Crafts bar on the second level also serves coffee, specialty drinks, and pastries fresh from Le Gourmet Break down the street. Plus, you can take your drink and snacks into the theater with you! Outside food and beverages are not permitted.\n\nDr. Phillips Center Bar and Refreshments | Image credit: Beth Bell\n\nPro-tip: The bars downstairs are the largest, however, the smaller bars upstairs carry all the same staples and tend to have shorter lines.\n\nAs you walk around before heading into your theater you'll probably observe how this awesome facility is a great place for the entire community. Locals love it, and it's great for visitors too.\n\nBONUS IDEA: Post Show Drinks at Judson's Live\n\nDr. Phillips Center\u2019s newest venue Judson\u2019s Live is NOW open post show every Thursday, Friday & Saturday. Starting March 6, after MJ The Musical, guests can experience stellar cocktails, world-class wines and shareable plates. No reservations needed. This will be an ongoing nightcap on those days for post-show.\n\nFor a classic date night pairing, grab dinner or drinks before or after a Broadway in Orlando show. Downtown Orlando is full of energy and creativity.\n\nHere are some of our favorite restaurants near Dr. Phillips Performing Arts Center.\n\nAC Sky Bar\n\n333 S Garland Ave Floor 18, Orlando, FL 32801\n\nDine on Spanish-inspired tapas and artisanal cocktails with a view at AC Sky Bar, one of our favorite rooftop bars in downtown Orlando.\n\nImage credit: AC Hotel Orlando Downtown\n\nThe Boheme\n\nThe Grand Bohemian Hotel\n\n325 S Orange Avenue, Orlando, FL 32801\n\nSet the mood at the Grand Bohemian's alluring hotel restaurant, The Boheme, just a few steps from the theater.

Recent developments in shareholder activism, with the filing of proposals focused on corporate governance and sustainability, were highlighted by events such as submissions from As You Sow and the National Legal and Policy Center. Meanwhile, the wider market experienced volatility, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posting monthly declines amid economic uncertainties, though a benign inflation reading provided some relief. These factors unfolded against a backdrop of industry-wide concerns, including the Trump administration's tariff plans which added to market tensions. Furthermore, while Bharti Airtel's merger talks, in which Disney holds a stake, illustrate ongoing sector changes, Disney's price movement remains a focal point within these complex dynamics.\n\nNYSE:DIS Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Feb 2025\n\nOver the past year, Walt Disney's total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, was 0.66%. This performance lagged behind the US Entertainment industry and broader US market, which delivered returns of 41.8% and 14.7%, respectively. Disney's performance could be linked to multiple factors. The company's Q1 2025 earnings showed an increased revenue of US$24.69 billion and net income of US$2.55 billion, suggesting operational improvements. However, the presence of large one-off losses may have affected perceptions of profitability. Investor activism included proposals on sustainability and corporate governance, indicating shareholder concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Disney announced a US$1.00 per share dividend, up from US$0.75, reflecting a strategic focus on returning value to shareholders. Meanwhile, legal challenges arose, with patent lawsuits filed against Disney impacting its media streaming operations. Continued share buybacks demonstrated an effort to bolster shareholder value, with US$3.8 billion spent under a recent buyback program. These events combined to shape Disney\u2019s share performance over the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

            "content": "When a movie becomes a massive hit for Disney at the box office, it's usually only a matter of time before it finds a home in the theme parks. Frozen is certainly no exception. The line to get a picture with Elsa and Anna is guaranteed to be long at a Disney park in the world.\n\nIn the years since the first movie Frozen presence at Disney parks has only grown. In 2023 the first World of Frozen theme park land opened at Hong Kong Disneyland, and a second version of the land is currently under construction at Disneyland Paris.\n\nWhile Walt Disney World doesn\u2019t have its own World of Frozen, at least not yet, it has plenty of Anna and Elsa and the rest for fans of the Frozen franchise for fans to enjoy across its four theme parks, two water parks, hotels, and more. If you\u2019re a serious Frozen fan on the way to Disney World, here\u2019s all the great stuff you won\u2019t want to miss\n\nFrozen At Epcot\n\n(Image credit: Walt Disney World)\n\nFrozen is one of Disney's fairy tales full of princesses, and as such, one might expect that most Frozen-related attractions are found at Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland. However, the truth is that the real home of Frozen at Walt Disney World is at Epcot. There, in the World Showcase, you'll find the Norway pavilion, and since The Snow Queen, which was the basis for Frozen, is a Scandinavian fairy tale (Hans Christian Andersen was Danish but never mind), that's where you'll find Frozen's home.\n\nFrozen Ever After - Ride/Attraction\n\nThere is one ride based around Frozen found at Walt Disney World. Frozen Ever After is a boat-based dark ride that took over the previous attraction in that location, Maelstrom. The ride vehicles and the route have remained the same in the attraction, but instead of a general look at Norway's history and culture, everything is based around Frozen.\n\nRather than being a simple retelling of either Frozen movie, Frozen Ever After just allows guests to float through the world of Frozen, seeing Elsa's ice castle, hearing \"Let it Go\" and also seeing Anna, Olaf, Marshmallow, and the rest. The voice cast from the film all reprise their roles for the ride so it feels like you're inside Arendelle. Not everybody loves the screen-based animatronic faces of the characters. Time will tell if we'll see them updated with the Hong Kong Disneyland versions of the animatronics.\n\nLuminous: The Symphony Of Us\n\n(Image credit: Walt Disney World/Matt Stroshane)\n\nThe newest night-time spectacular at Walt Disney World\u2019s theme parks can be found at Epcot, with Luminous: The Symphony Of Us. The show combines the best parts of Illuminations: Reflections of Earth with the recent 50th-anniversary celebration show, Harmonious, without the eye-sore barges. The show contains original versions of several big Disney songs and includes an epic rendition of Frozen II\u2019s \u201cShow Yourself\u201d near the end of the show which lights up the entire World Showcase Lagoon in lights and fireworks.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFrozen Characters In Epcot\n\nIf seeing Anna and Elsa in animatronic form isn't good enough you can meet the \"real\" people for a photo op, also found at the Norway pavilion. Anna and Elsa have taken up residence at the Royal Sommerhaus, and they can be found there more or less all day, every day. While maybe not as popular as they were when they first arrived, Anna and Elsa are still among the most popular characters in the park for photos, so that's something to keep in mind.\n\nThe Fjording\n\nNo area of Disney World is compete without a gift shop, and so, of course the Norway Pavilion has one. The Fjording isn't a Frozen gift shop specifically. It has lots of Norway themed items, with references to traditional Scandinavian folklore, Vikings, and more. But you will find a not insignificant amount Frozen merchandise there as well.\n\nThe Wandering Reindeer - Photopass Location\n\nPreviously, The Wandering Reindeer was a gift shop that guests meeting Anna and Elsa would exit through. However, the location remained closed following Disney World\u2019s pandemic period. The Wandering Reindeer is open once again. Now, it\u2019s a Frozen-themed Photopass location . Photopass photographers are on hand to take your picture in front of a wintery backdrop and they can add a bit of Frozen magic to your pictures with a Magic Shot that will add Frozen 2\u2019s fire spirit Bruni to your pics.\n\nKringla Bakeri Og Kafe\n\nIf you want some Frozen food, but aren't looking to spend too much to get it, visit the Norway Pavilion bakery. While the bakery's main menu is more inspired by the traditional foods of Norway than any particular animated Disney movie, they usually have at least a couple of special Frozen-inspired items that you won't find anywhere else.\n\nFrozen At Disney's Hollywood Studios\n\n(Image credit: Walt Disney World)\n\nHollywood may be a long way from Norway, but there's still plenty of Frozen fun to have at Disney's Hollywood Studios. The second of the two Frozen attractions is here along with the second big meet-and-greet opportunity, because there's one member of the Frozen cast who would probably love living in sunny Southern California rather than cold Arendelle.\n\nFor the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration\n\nIf there is a single reason that Frozen is so beloved, it's probably the music. The first Frozen soundtrack blew up thanks to the power of \"Let it Go\" and Frozen 2's music, while maybe not hitting quite the same level (because how could it) still has some truly great songs. Get together with other Frozen fans here and belt out all your favorites. A combination of movie scenes, live-cast members, and sing-along lyrics on-screen combine to make singing your favorite Frozen song a breeze. Do you want to build a snowman?\n\nFrozen Characters At Disney's Hollywood Studios\n\nOnce you've received Anna and Elsa's autographs, you can go to where Olaf the Snowman is enjoying the summer in Hollywood. He can be found in the Echo Lake area of Hollywood Studios meeting guests. Fans who want to give Olaf a warm hug won't want to miss this one. Just be careful not to knock Olaf over.\n\nFrozen Fractal Gift Shop\n\nOnce you've met Olaf, you can head over to the nearby Frozen Fractal Gift Shop to pick up Frozen merch. Since this is the only gift shop specifically focused on Frozen, it's likely to have the best available stock for your Elsa, Anna, and Olaf needs.\n\nFrozen At Magic Kingdom\n\n(Image credit: Walt Disney World)\n\nMagic Kingdom is the home to Fantasyland and most Disney Princesses, and so, you can be sure that Anna, Elsa, and more from Frozen can be found in Walt Disney World's first and most popular theme park. Not only can you see them, if you wish, you can be them.\n\nMickey's Magical Friendship Faire\n\nMickey's Magical Friendship Faire is a stage show that takes place in front of Cinderella's Castle throughout the day at Magic Kingdom, and it brings many of your favorite Disney characters together. Of course, you'll get Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, and the rest of the core Disney gang, but you'll also meet Flynn and Rapunzel, Tiana and Naveen, and yes, Anna, Elsa, and Olaf as well.\n\nDisney Festival of Fantasy Parade\n\nThere are few parades like Walt Disney World parades. The floats are always a sight to behold, showing off some of the coolest things that Walt Disney World can do, and to be sure when there's a parade at Magic Kingdom, Anna and Elsa will be there. The pair have their own float in the Festival of Fantasy parade, and it's sure to be a magical experience for everybody.\n\nHappily Ever After Fireworks\n\nThere's no better way to end an evening at any Walt Disney World park than with a nighttime spectacular and there may be no nighttime spectacular better than the Happily Ever After fireworks show at Magic Kingdom. Between the music and the projection mapping on Cinderella's Castle you'll see and hear all your favorite Disney characters, but you'll see your Frozen friends more than once, and hear a verse of a spectacular cover of \"Love is an Open Door\" that for some reason has never been released as a single anywhere and that needs to be remedied.\n\nBibbidi Bobbidi Boutique\n\nIf simply seeing Anna and Elsa or experiencing an attraction with Anna and Elsa isn't enough, then maybe you need to be Anna or Elsa. You can, or at least, your kids can, if you visit the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, where children can be transformed into their favorite Disney characters, and of course, the women of Frozen are two of the most popular choices.\n\nFrozen At Blizzard Beach Water Park\n\n(Image credit: Dirk Libbey)\n\nWhile there are four full theme parks at Walt Disney World there is so much more to experience there, including two separate water parks. Fun with Frozen can be found there as well.\n\nFrozen at Tike's Peak\n\nWalt Disney World did take advantage of the fact that it was forced to close large portions of its parks during the global pandemic by using the opportunity to do some significant refurbishment. One of the places that saw a lot of work done was the Blizzard Beach water park. Specifically, the Tike\u2019s Peak children\u2019s area was given a Frozen-themed makeover that includes Olaf, the snowgies, and child versions of Elsa and Anna decorating the pool area.\n\nBe aware, however, that Disney World runs its two water parks on a rotating schedule, with only one being open at a time. Blizzard Beach usually closes in spring, around March or April, and reopens again in the fall, usually around early November.\n\nOther Walt Disney World Resort Locations\n\nWhile the theme parks are, of course, the core of the Walt Disney World fun, there is a lot more to do on the Walt Disney World property than just go on rides. If you need even more Frozen in your vacation check out these options.\n\nFrozen In the My Disney Experience App (Genie+ required)\n\nFrozen is only a couple of clicks away when visiting Disney World. Open up the My Disney Experience App, and if you purchase Genie+, you'll have access to Photopass lenses, which allow you to take pictures of yourself or others in various Disney-themed environments. A couple of these are Frozen-themed, including one that drops Olaf in the background to throw snowballs at you, and another that lets you create snow and ice like Elsa.\n\nFrozen isn\u2019t going anywhere at Walt Disney World. With not just a third, but a fourth Frozen movie on the way, there will be an entirely new story and characters that will likely find their way into the parks in new ways.",

            "content": "Despite being such an iconic business, Walt Disney (DIS 1.83%) has made for a terrible investment in recent years. Since February 2019, the share price of the media and entertainment giant is down 22%, which is worrying when you see the huge gain of the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%).\n\nIt can be easy to toss Disney out of consideration for your portfolio, but I believe the company deserves a closer look, with shares trading 46% below their peak. Here are three reasons to buy this top consumer discretionary stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. Direct-to-consumer success\n\nThe first reason to scoop up Disney stock is the improving situation within the direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming segment. After launching Disney+ in November 2019, the business was posting massive operating losses in this division as it spent heavily to scale up the service. This seems to be a key factor that weighed on the stock.\n\nBut DTC is turning the corner financially. Disney+ and Hulu combined raked in $293 million in operating income in the first quarter of Disney's fiscal 2025 (which ended Dec. 28). Management expects $1 billion for the full fiscal year. Then, in 2026, the plan is to register a 10% operating margin, up drastically from basically zero in fiscal 2024.\n\nIt's amazing what an intense focus on cost efficiencies can do, as CEO Bob Iger aims to limit the quantity of content created in favor of higher-quality output. Running a tighter ship in this regard hasn't gotten in the way of membership growth, as in the latest fiscal quarter Disney+ and Hulu (excluding Live TV) each increased their subscriber counts by 12% and 9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThanks to its tremendous intellectual property (IP), Disney has become a streaming winner with proven pricing power. And it's poised to continue its success in the years ahead. That's because it has the unique capability to bundle its services for consumers, which can support higher engagement and lower churn.\n\nAdd this to the upcoming launch of the flagship ESPN streaming service, and it's not unreasonable to expect Disney's DTC operation to add billions of dollars to the bottom line in the years ahead.\n\n2. Growth in the experiences segment\n\nThe second reason is Disney's parks, cruises, and consumer products, known collectively as the experiences segment. In fiscal 2024, this provided 37% of company revenue and 60% of operating income. It's arguably the single most important aspect of the overall business. And it's probably the most competitively advantaged, given the high barriers to entry in the industry, as well as Disney's ability to raise prices over time.\n\nExecutives are doubling down, with the intention to spend $60 billion on capital expenditures on the segment over the next decade. This includes adding new attractions at parks and bringing more cruise ships to the fleet. Essentially, Disney is focused on boosting capacity in an effort to serve more customers across the globe.\n\nThis strategy makes sense. According to management, \"for every one guest who visits a Disney Park, there are more than ten people with Disney affinity who do not visit the Parks.\" It's safe to say that there's lots of untapped demand.\n\n3. An undervalued stock\n\nThe third reason is that the stock looks inexpensive. With Disney shares trading at 46% off their all-time high, it's reasonable to see them as extraordinarily undervalued today. The market has rightfully been concerned about the company's ability to successfully navigate a changing media landscape. But based on the latest financial results, Disney is making great strides.\n\nInvestors have the opportunity to buy shares at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.8 -- a 12% discount to the overall S&P 500. That disparity should close, and even reverse, once the market stops forgetting that Disney is a top consumer brand with world-class IP and growing earnings power. Bullish investors should consider buying the stock.",

As its name suggests, the area was home to considerable mining activity in the 19th century and later to collections of mountain cabins in places like Silver City.\n\nThe area's natural beauty and snow covered slopes caught the attention of Walt Disney. Following the success of the 1960 Winter Olympics near Lake Tahoe, Disney was looking to get into the ski resort business and Mineral King was just the place.\n\nIn early 1966, the U.S. Forest Service awarded Disney a permit to develop a resort there. Back then, Mineral King was part of the Sequoia National Forest. Disney envisioned a development with a hotel, restaurants, and a theater. There would be as many as 14 ski lifts, accommodating up to 10,000 skiers a day.\n\nBut shortly after the plan was announced, problems mounted. In late 1966, Walt Disney died. Soon the Sierra Club organized opposition to the plan and sued, seeking to preserve the alpine valley, and the Disney Company shifted its focus to building Walt Disney World. In 1978 Mineral King became a part of Sequoia National Park.\n\nOnly one element of Disney's vision for the resort was eventually built, but not in the Tulare County mountains. Instead, Disney's vision for a theater show with singing and dancing \"audio-animatronic\" bears was realized as the County Bear Jamboree, which you can currently find at Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom in Florida.\n\n",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into The Walt Disney Co's (NYSE:DIS) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-02-26, The Walt Disney Co's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $60.82. It's currently trading at a price of $110.53. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -81.73%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. The Walt Disney Co's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $5.27 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.31%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = -4.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 25.03 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 8.16 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 60.82\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $53.19. This valuation indicates that the The Walt Disney Co is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -107.8%.

            "content": "Wicked reignited audience interest in fantasy live-action adaptations, after years of malaise, and Snow White has the chance to be propelled by that same energy. The new musical take from Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man) on the fairy tale that built Walt Disney animation as we know it will be the first live-action reimagining of the year among a surprisingly busy slate for the field, including DreamWorks\u2019 How to Train Your Dragon and another Disney release, Lilo & Stitch.\n\nJon M. Chu\u2019s cinematic musical triumph brought back interest in fantasy adaptations in a real way by leaning into its roots wholeheartedly. It created an Oz with grand, lived-in sets; attempted to make CG backgrounds and staging as unobtrusive to the audience as possible; and of course played into the electric chemistry of its powerhouse leads. There was definite magic in its success, and Wicked: For Good will hope to replicate that later this year.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of magic that we\u2019d expect from Disney, but it\u2019s something the studio has had trouble distilling from its own classic fairytales in its live-action remakes, which have proven divisive among audiences and critics. Over the years there have been concerns that the first few relied too heavily on green screen and withheld singing early on, particularly Cinderella (with cut songs performed by Lily James) and Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty\u2019s de facto adaptation, a villain retelling which aped Wicked). When Beauty and the Beast came along, Emma Watson looked and acted the part of Belle, but the illusion fell apart when what sounded like auto-tune karaoke came out of her mouth for some of the greatest Disney songs ever written.\n\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s surprising future Wicked star Ariana Grande was seemingly not considered for Belle, though the film\u2019s 2017 release came before we knew the singer\u2019s aspirations to lean back into acting. It doesn\u2019t all fall on Watson\u2019s voice, however; while she embodied Belle\u2019s archetype perfectly, the CG work around her was more of an issue. The ensemble looked like nightmare dead-eyed versions of the household objects they\u2019re inspired by more than the characters we knew and loved. And don\u2019t get me started on how dirty they did Dan Stevens with that atrocious Beast design, which could have been an incredible opportunity to showcase creature makeup effects and his talent.\n\nSo it\u2019s no wonder that by the time Guy Ritchie\u2019s Aladdin came along and we got the first look at Will Smith as the Genie it turned off audiences. Thankfully he didn\u2019t look that way for most of the film and led a very solid cast in Ritchie\u2019s more good than bad musical adaptation of the Disney hit. One of the film\u2019s biggest revelations was Naomi Scott\u2019s Jasmine, who was the first princess in a live-action adaptation to get everything right\u2014she had the voice and acting chops (if you don\u2019t believe us, watch Smile 2). Even her new song, \u201cSpeechless,\u201d composed by Alan Menken with songwriting duo Pasek and Paul (who are back for Snow White), suited her character\u2019s motivations to be more than a princess. It\u2019s such an underrated piece and paid off in the end with her essentially becoming Sultan with Aladdin as her regent.\n\nWith The Little Mermaid, Disney scored another casting win with Halle Bailey\u2019s Ariel. Like Scott, Bailey is an incredible singer and actress who exemplifies why these heroines are so beloved. Bailey\u2019s Ariel broke so much ground and you could say she paved the way for Elphaba; unfortunately, she also angered trolls and outright racists who took issue with the casting of young Black woman as a mythical mermaid. The Little Mermaid wasn\u2019t a flop, but it fell short of the success found by Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. Any blame for that should be placed squarely on the film\u2019s visual choices first and foremost\u2014relying too much on just plain freaky-looking computer-generated animation that failed to elevate Ursula\u2019s body language while also giving us wonky sidekicks, particularly Sebastian, who was sorely lacking his presence from the animated film.\n\nFortunately, fantasy adaptations haven\u2019t drowned in the deep just yet. Chu\u2019s take on Wicked was able to extract the core of L. Frank Baum\u2019s fairy tale novel, reimagine the enchantment of MGM\u2019s The Wizard of Oz, and give Broadway\u2019s own adaptive spin on Gregory Maguire\u2019s radical novel a widely accepted new canon. That\u2019s exactly the sort of achievement Disney Princess fans want and hope from Snow White and any future live-action adaptations. From the moment Rachel Zegler began to sing in Steven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story, her casting as Snow White made perfect sense. The trailers live and die on her musical talent, while the film\u2019s aesthetic and character design choices appear to be strikingly similar to the animated film. (One big point of contention has been the choice to make the dwarves essentially CG versions of their animated characters; it\u2019s been speculated that Disney moved away from casting actors at the behest of Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage urging the studio on a podcast to not typecast people with types of dwarfism.)\n\nIt will be interesting to see if these upcoming live-action adaptations have something new to say about the classics for this generation of genre fans, rather than seemingly just being assembly-line produced to make a buck out of their beloved brands. Wicked offered up fresh perspectives with the backdrop of the Emerald City which made audiences fall in love with its world all over again. And yes, that gave Universal a new franchise to capitalize on with merchandise in high demand and the hopes for theme park immersion. Just this week Universal announced that fans will be able to meet Elphaba and Glinda in its theme parks, much like how fans can meet Disney Princesses at Disney Parks. There was no comparable option, unless you count Princess Peach and Princess Fiona, until now.\n\nThe way Wicked made fairytale core and whimsical witchy core exciting again with tie-in fashion, accessories, and makeup is a moment we\u2019re still wanting more of because of how the movie presented these new figures to look up to. That\u2019s how it should be, not the other way around, in order to keep an appetite for these reimagined classics. They made me want to own pieces inspired by Elphaba and Glinda as relatable characters; it\u2019s why I own an obnoxious amount of things that say \u201cDefy Gravity\u201d on them. I hope Snow White\u2019s collections have their own story to tell and identify with. As a Latina and mom to a half-Latina baby I\u2019m ecstatic about seeing Zegler play Snow White\u2026 but I\u2019m also worried.\n\nThe way Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo got to make their dreams come true playing Glinda and Elphaba, I want that for Zegler\u2014and while we\u2019re at it, Halle Bailey too, since both performers have experienced weird bigotry for taking ownership of their characters. They\u2019re the ones Disney crowned, not random hags and trolls of the internet. Zegler recently shared with Vogue Mexico that she simply believes that Snow White should be \u201cthe leader who knows who she can be,\u201d giving her multitudes outside of her relationship with the prince. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that audiences know Disney has found a beautiful and delicate balance with the classic animated film the whole world knows and loves from 1937, and at the same time represents a new generation,\u201d Zegler said.\n\nSo it was really weird that her few words on the film, which included jokingly comparing the original prince to a \u201cstalker\u201d and expressing relief that her take on the princess had more agency, was widely treated as if she made the calls when she was operating under the direction set forth by Marc Webb and Disney. Erivo, who spoke out about the importance of her Elphaba casting as a Black queer woman\u2014breaking the outdated Wicked Witch stereotype from the book and original film to drown out the haters, and embodying the character for a new generation\u2014was greatly supported by her director and studio. Zegler should be able to allow herself the joy of being a Latina Snow White with the agency to represent something evolved from the core of the classic Snow White and just as protected as our new princess.\n\nShe continued to express what Snow means to her in her Vogue piece: \u201cHer superpower is her heart, Snow White doesn\u2019t posses any supernatural power. That\u2019s more powerful than her love for humanity, for all living creatures and her fundamental belief that there\u2019s goodness in everything\u2014that\u2019s something I really think the world needs more of.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s since made peace with the backlash she received, seeing it as fans just being \u201cpassionate [for the film], and what an honor to be a part of something people have so much passion for. We\u2019re not always going to share the same feelings as those around us so all we can do is give the best of ourselves.\u201d\n\nAnd we agree, Snow White should be allowed to reinterpret the character\u2019s journey in the same aspirational ways which propelled Wicked\u2019s success. So please, please, Disney\u2014don\u2019t prove the naysayers right and let us bite into a poison apple.",

So much more than just a single race, the Walt Disney World Marathon is an entire weekend that includes a variety of events for runners of different ages and experience levels (and plenty of non-race fun, too!).\n\nThe Walt Disney World Marathon is hosted by runDisney, a division of Disney Sports Enterprises \u2013 in fact, the marathon is the flagship runDisney event. And since 1994, it\u2019s been a staple at Disney World, hosting more than 10,000 finishers in total. In fact, it\u2019s one of the 10 largest marathons in the U.S.\n\nThinking about signing up for the next marathon or another race event? Click below to jump to the information you need to know about the Walt Disney World Marathon:\n\nWalt Disney World Marathon: Race Events and Challenges\n\nWhile the highlight of the annual Walt Disney World Marathon is, obviously, the marathon itself, that 26.2-mile race isn\u2019t the sole event. Runners can choose from a number of different races, all with different distances, themes, and finisher medals.\n\nFor the 2026 Walt Disney World Marathon, runners can choose from six events: four different races and two challenges. The event takes place from January 7 to 11, 2026.\n\nNo matter which race event you choose, the magic of the Walt Disney World Marathon is each course takes you through the resort\u2019s grounds. You\u2019ll race through the four theme parks, step into Blizzard Beach Water Park, and even travel around Seven Seas Lagoon.\n\nThe courses do vary from event to event, but if you\u2019re brave enough to try some of the most daring challenges, you may get to see all four theme parks over the course of the marathon weekend.\n\nWalt Disney World 5K\n\nThe Walt Disney World 5K is a 3.1-mile race themed after Pluto. Along the route, which travels through EPCOT and around World Showcase Lagoon, you\u2019ll pass Disney characters and fun entertainment \u2013 and you\u2019ll receive a 5K finisher medal, participant shirt, and downloadable finisher certificate.\n\nRace Details\n\nDate: Thursday, January 8, 2026\n\nStart Time: 5:00 AM Eastern time\n\nWalt Disney World 10K\n\nThe Walt Disney World 10K is a 6.2-mile race themed after Chip \u2018n Dale. Along the route, which takes runners through EPCOT and past resorts like Disney\u2019s BoardWalk Inn and Disney\u2019s Beach Club and Yacht Club, you\u2019ll pass Disney characters and fun entertainment \u2013 and you\u2019ll receive a 10K finisher medal, participant shirt, and downloadable finisher certificate.\n\nRace Details\n\nDate: Friday, January 9, 2026\n\nStart Time: 5:00 AM Eastern time\n\nWalt Disney World Half Marathon\n\nThe Walt Disney World Half Marathon is a 13.1-mile race themed after Donald Duck and Daisy Duck. Along the route, which starts at EPCOT and takes runners to Seven Seas Lagoon and into Magic Kingdom Park, you\u2019ll pass Disney characters and fun entertainment \u2013 and you\u2019ll receive a half marathon finisher medal, participant shirt, and downloadable finisher certificate.\n\nRace Details\n\nDate: Saturday, January 10, 2026\n\nStart Time: 5:00 AM Eastern time\n\nWalt Disney World Marathon\n\nThe Walt Disney World Marathon is a 26.2-mile race themed after Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse. Along the route, which takes runners into all four theme parks, you\u2019ll pass Disney characters and fun entertainment \u2013 and you\u2019ll receive a marathon finisher medal, participant shirt, and downloadable finisher certificate.\n\nRace Details\n\nDate: Sunday, January 11, 2026\n\nStart Time: 4:3 0 AM Eastern time\n\nGoofy\u2019s Race and a Half Challenge\n\nGoofy\u2019s Race and a Half is a runDisney challenge that requires runners to complete both the Walt Disney World Half Marathon and Marathon races on pace. At the race\u2019s end, finishers earn the Walt Disney World Half Marathon and Marathon medals, plus a special Goofy\u2019s Race and a Half Challenge medal \u2013 and the pride in having run 39.3 miles!\n\nRace Details\n\nDate: Saturday, January 10 and Sunday, January 11, 2026\n\nStart Time: 5:00 AM Eastern time (1/10) and 4:30 AM Eastern time (1/11)\n\nDopey Challenge\n\nThe Dopey Challenge is a runDisney challenge that requires runners to complete all four of the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend races on pace.

It\u2019s not only where participants need to head to pick up their race bib and participant shirt, but also where you\u2019ll find special marathon-themed merchandise (which can even be pre-purchased!).\n\nRegistering for the Disney World Marathon\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in participating in the annual Walt Disney World Marathon, you\u2019ll need to act fast \u2013 and early.\n\nRegistration for runDisney events always opens about eight months ahead of a race date. So, with the marathon taking place in January, you can expect registration to open in April each year.\n\nFor the 2026 Walt Disney World Marathon, event registration opens on March 4, 2025 for Club runDisney Gold and Platinum members. General registration opens on March 11, 2025.\n\nNo matter when registration opens, you\u2019ll want to act fast. The most popular races can sell out in minutes once general registration opens up, leaving little time to think about what you\u2019re interested in participating in.\n\nWhat About Eligibility, Proof of Time, and Pacing?\n\nIf you\u2019re signing up for your first-ever Walt Disney World Marathon event, a lot of specific jargon around the race events can seem confusing. But really, anyone can sign up and run \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be a highly experienced runner.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s a good idea to look at the eligibility requirements for the races. Here\u2019s what that typically looks like for all events:\n\n5K participants must be at least 5 years old on race day and able to complete the event on their own\n\n10K participants must be at least 10 years old\n\nHalf marathon participants must be at least 14 years old\n\nMarathon participants must be at least 18 years old\n\nGoofy\u2019s Race and Dopey Challenge participants must be at least 18 years old\n\nAnd when it comes to proof of time, you don\u2019t technically have to submit any proof of time. Proof of time is required for runners who believe they can finish the Disney World Half Marathon in 2 hours and 30 minutes (or less) or the Disney World Marathon in 5 hours (or less). This will ensure speedy, experienced runners get the right start group placement.\n\nIf you do provide proof of time, you\u2019ll need it to be from an officially-timed race on a USATF certified course. You\u2019ll submit your proof of time during the registration process.\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re worried about pacing, note the pacing requirements for all Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend events:\n\nRunners must maintain a minimum 16-minutes-per-mile pace for all race distances\n\nA 15-minutes-per-mile pace is recommended, if you\u2019re training\n\nPace cyclists will be on the race courses to indicate when runners fall behind pace\n\nWalt Disney World Marathon Weekend Transportation\n\nWhile you\u2019ll spend a good amount of your time during the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend running around the resort, you will need to rely on transportation to get to and from starting lines, the runDisney Health & Fitness Expo, and even your hotel.\n\nBecause the weekend\u2019s races begin very early \u2013 well before the theme parks open \u2013 and there are numerous road closures across the resort for the event\u2019s courses, figuring out how to get around Disney World can be a little tricky. Fortunately, resort transportation is up and running, so you don\u2019t necessarily need to rent a car to get around.\n\nStaying onsite at a Disney World Resort hotel is one of the easiest options. You\u2019ll be able to utilize Disney World\u2019s bus transportation to get to the starting point (EPCOT) for the event. Plus, Disney World\u2019s bus drivers will know which roads are closed, ensuring effortless transportation.\n\nHowever, if you choose to stay offsite, you can rely on rideshare services like Uber or Lyft. Early mornings don\u2019t necessarily mean there are no drivers available \u2013 many people do need to get to the airport for early flights! But there\u2019s no guarantee that a driver will be available, and the drivers may not be well-versed in the marathon\u2019s road closures.\n\nYou can, alternatively, drive yourself and park at EPCOT. This is a good option if you don\u2019t want much of a hassle trying to find a ride and don\u2019t mind walking to and from your car pre- and post-race.\n\nWalt Disney World Marathon: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow much does it cost to enter the Walt Disney World Marathon?\n\nThe registration costs vary depending on when, exactly, you register for your chosen Walt Disney World Marathon races (and which, along with how many, races you\u2019re participating in).\n\nFor example, the Walt Disney World 5K is $120 for runners who sign up between March 11 and September 8, 2025. Anyone registering after September 8 will pay a higher fee of $130. The Walt Disney World Marathon cost $242 for early registrants, and $252 for those who register after September 8.\n\nCan you walk the Walt Disney World Marathon?\n\nYes, you can walk the marathon! In fact, you can actually walk any of the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend events. As long as you maintain the minimum pacing requirement (a 16-minute mile pace), you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nPlanning to walk, but might fall behind that pace? If you\u2019re flagged as behind, a shuttle will pick you up along the course and ferry you to the end of its route.\n\nDo you need to qualify for the Walt Disney World Marathon?\n\nThere are no qualification requirements for any of the runDisney races other than age. runDisney recommends checking with a health professional if you\u2019re concerned about your ability to run any race safely.",

Bob Iger, Bob Chapek, and former Disney CFO Christine McCarthy have all represented Disney at this conference.\n\nDisney is expected to announce who will be the next person to lead the company as CEO in early 2026. With that in mind, Disney watchers are looking for indicators of who might take over the CEO role. Walden\u2019s participating in this conference could be seen as a clue. She has been commonly recognized as someone who is on the short list to take over as CEO when Bob Iger retires.\n\nThe announcement that Dana Walden would be representing Disney for this event was released by the company on Tuesday:\n\nThe Walt Disney Company To Participate In The Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, And Telecom Conference BURBANK, Calif., February 25, 2025 \u2013 Dana Walden, Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) will participate in a question-and-answer session at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference on Tuesday, March 4, 2025 at approximately 6:20 p.m. ET/ 3:20 p.m. PT. To stream live, please visit www.disney.com/investors.

Season 2 will see the characters and their relationships intensify as the horizon of war draws near and Cassian becomes a key player in the Rebel Alliance. Everyone will be tested and, as the stakes rise, the betrayals, sacrifices, and conflicting agendas will become profound.\n\nRife with political intrigue, danger, tension, and high stakes, the series is a prequel to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which portrayed a heroic band of rebels who steal the plans to the Empire\u2019s weapon of mass destruction: The Death Star, setting the stage for the events of the original 1977 film. Andor sets the clock back five years from the events of Rogue One to tell the story of the film\u2019s hero, Cassian Andor, and his transformation from disinterested, cynical nobody into a rebel hero on his way to an epic destiny.\n\n\u201cOne of the great thrills of making Andor is the scale of the story and the number of characters we\u2019re able to meet \u2014 ordinary people, Imperial overlords, passionate revolutionaries,\u201d said creator and executive producer Tony Gilroy. \u201cThey are real people making epic decisions, all of them staring down questions with terrifying consequences. Cassian\u2019s journey is the soul and spine of our story, but it\u2019s the choir that makes the show. I\u2019m so excited for audiences to see where we go in Season 2.\u201d\n\nThe final season will unfold over 12 episodes broken down into four chapters of three episodes each. The first chapter will premiere Tuesday, April 22, with subsequent chapters debuting each week.\n\nAndor Season 2 stars Diego Luna, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Genevieve O\u2019Reilly, Denise Gough, Kyle Soller, Adria Arjona, Faye Marsay, Varada Sethu, Elizabeth Dulau, and Alan Tudyk, with Ben Mendelsohn and Forest Whitaker. The series was created by Tony Gilroy, who serves as an executive producer alongside Kathleen Kennedy, Sanne Wohlenberg, Luna, Luke Hull, and John Gilroy. Tony Gilroy wrote the first three episodes, with Beau Willimon writing episodes 4-6, Dan Gilroy writing episodes 7-9, and Tom Bissell writing episodes 10-12. The directors for the series are Ariel Kleiman (episodes 1-6), Janus Metz (episodes 7-9), and Alonso Ruizpalacios (episodes 10-12).",

But, once upon a time, America almost had the most magical ski area on Earth.\n\nTucked in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains sits Mineral King Valley, a pristine subalpine basin accessible only by foot or a single, small winding road\u2014a place so beautiful it could easily be the backdrop of a Disney movie. And that makes all the more sense when you learn that it was poised to become a premier ski destination under the leadership of Walt Disney.\n\nIt was an ambitious project which, at first, was supported by the Forest Service, but later found opposition so strong it never had its happy ending. But here's what could have been\u2014and more about how Walt Disney impacted the ski industry.\n\nWalt Disney and Skiing\n\nDisney was a rather avid sports fan. His love for baseball is well documented, and he was even a semi-pro equestrian, playing polo throughout his life. But it turns out Disney was quite the winter sports fanatic, too. According to the Disney Family Museum, it all began when a doctor suggested Disney take up skiing in the 1930s after he sustained a neck injury playing polo as a new way to relieve stress. So, he and his wife, Lillian, took lessons at Yosemite's Badger Pass, where they met Austrian skiing champion Hannes Schroll, head of the Yosemite Ski School, starting a friendship that also lasted his lifetime and led to the successful development of one ski resort (more on that in a bit) and the dream of Disney Mineral King. Disney even produced the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1960 Winter Olympics held in California.\n\nDisney's Mineral King Ski Resort Plans\n\nMineral King Valley is a year-round paradise, but its base elevation, glacial-sculpted landscape, and peaks reaching upward of 12,343 feet make it a prime destination for skiing. And that's why in 1965, when the U.S. Forest Service sent out a request for proposals for a ski resort, Disney answered the call\u2014and ultimately won.\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw Mineral King five years ago, I thought it was one of the most beautiful spots I had ever seen, and we want to keep it that way,\" Disney shared in a statement at the time. The news of Disney's potential ski resort was announced just one month after the company shared that they purchased the land in Orlando that would one day become Disney World.\n\nDisney's ambitious plan for an \"American alpine wonderland\" included everything you'd need for a self-contained ski getaway. That included:\n\nAccommodations: The plan included a five-story hotel with 1,030 rooms.\n\nThe plan included a five-story hotel with 1,030 rooms. Recreational facilities: The ski area's plan had 22 lifts and gondolas spread across eight peaks, which would have given guests access to runs up to four miles long with vertical drops of 3,700 feet.\n\nThe ski area's plan had 22 lifts and gondolas spread across eight peaks, which would have given guests access to runs up to four miles long with vertical drops of 3,700 feet. Amenities: 10 restaurants and cafes (including on-mountain dining options), an ice-skating rink, swimming pools, tennis courts, a golf course, a movie theater, and entertainment venues were all included in the plan.\n\n10 restaurants and cafes (including on-mountain dining options), an ice-skating rink, swimming pools, tennis courts, a golf course, a movie theater, and entertainment venues were all included in the plan. Transportation: This was a critical component for Disney, who aimed to preserve as much of the Mineral King environment as possible. The plan included an up to 10-story parking structure outside of the main resort, along with a cog railway to transport guests to and from the facility to ensure the village remained car-free.\n\nThere was also a little Disney magic originally planned for the park that made its way into Disneyland. According to PBS, the Disney Imagineers designed a few robotic characters to sing and put on a show at one of the restaurants\u2014and those robots eventually became the bears at the Country Bear Jamboree.\n\nDespite all the meticulous planning by the Disney team, the Mineral King project ultimately faced significant opposition from environmental groups, including the Sierra Club. An ensuing legal battle stalled the project's momentum, and the area eventually became part of the Sequoia National Park, and downhill ski resorts were banned in the area, according to the L.A. Times.\n\nWalt Disney's Ski Legacy\n\nAlthough the Mineral King project never came to fruition, Disney\u2019s legacy in the skiing world lives on at the Sugar Bowl Ski Resort, about a seven-hour drive north of Mineral King. Remember that friendship with Hannes Schroll? It led Disney to assist in the development of Sugar Bowl after Schroll purchased the land in 1938 for $6,750. Disney, the mountain explained, invested $2,500, and in return, \"Schroll renamed Hemlock Peak 'Mt. Disney,'\" which also became the location of the resort's first chairlift\u2014The Disney Lift\u2014and the first chairlift in California. At the time, a lift ticket cost $0.25 for a ride up or \"$2.00 if you wanted to ski down,\" about the equivalent of $44 today. As Sugar Bowl shared with Travel + Leisure, \"We're not telling where, but to this day, we occasionally hide a pair of Mickey Mouse ears in paintings or printed materials for the resort.\n\nDisney\u2019s love for winter sports extended into his animated films like \"The Art of Skiing\" (1941), which follows Goofy's adventures (and misadventures) on the slopes. And if you look closely, you can spot the original Sugar Bowl Village Lodge in animated form.\n\n",

            "content": "Your next Disney Parks vacation could be priced very differently, if rumors of demand-based pricing at Disney World and Disneyland are true.\n\nPrices at Disney World and Disneyland change regularly, but according to recent rumors, theme park ticket pricing just might be about to undergo a massive change. It\u2019s been mentioned that Disney has been thinking about pricing park tickets based on demand and crowd levels for years now \u2013 so is demand-based ticket pricing really coming to Disney World and Disneyland?\n\nHere\u2019s everything we know so far.\n\nWhat is Demand-Based Ticket Pricing?\n\nDemand-based ticket pricing is a dynamic pricing strategy. Essentially, when demand is high, the price increases. When demand is low, the price decreases.\n\nDemand-based pricing at Disney World and Disneyland would mean that ticket prices fluctuate depending on how popular the date in question is. If it\u2019s a busy day at the parks, you\u2019re likely to pay a higher price when you purchase tickets in advance. And if the parks get increasingly busier on the day in question, it\u2019s possible that prices could actually rise day-of \u2013 making spur-of-the-moment or last-minute tickets see pricing changes.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t yet know exactly how demand-based pricing would work for Disney World or Disneyland theme park tickets, we do know that the system has already been rolled out at Disneyland Paris.\n\nAt Disneyland Paris, the introduction of demand-based ticket pricing eliminated preset pricing for set dates. Now, single-day ticket prices vary year-round, but they typically stay in a fixed range \u2013 and there is a set price range, so tickets typically won\u2019t get any cheaper than \u20ac65 and don\u2019t get any more expensive than \u20ac119 (though there are a few exceptions, like New Year\u2019s Eve).\n\nDisney World and Disneyland Already Use a Form of Demand-Based Pricing\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about how the switch to demand-based pricing at Disney World and Disneyland could drive up the cost of your next vacation, I have some good news: These parks already use a form of demand-based pricing.\n\nBoth Disney World and Disneyland use date-based ticket pricing, which means the price guests pay for theme park tickets varies depending on the dates they\u2019re planning to visit.\n\nWhen you purchase theme park tickets for Disney World, you\u2019ll select the exact dates you\u2019d like to visit \u2013 and the price will reflect your date choices. Visit during the most crowded times of the year, and your tickets will be more expensive. Opt to visit during slower periods that see fewer crowds, and you\u2019ll pay less.\n\nDisney World also rolled out park-specific ticket pricing in 2022, so guests who purchase one-day tickets are subject to park-by-park pricing in addition to date-based pricing.\n\nDisneyland specifically uses tiered date-based tickets, with theme park tickets assigned a price tier from Tier 0 to Tier 6. Days during the least busy seasons of the year are Tier 0, the cheapest tier, while the most crowded will fall into Tier 6, the most expensive. (You can see the tier breakdown for 2025 here.)\n\nAnd you can\u2019t forget about Lightning Lane Multi Pass. Disney\u2019s skip-the-line service already utilizes demand-based pricing, with the per-day, per-guest price fluctuating depending on demand. And Lightning Lane\u2019s demand-based pricing has shown us what we can expect if Disney moves to demand-based ticket pricing: The most crowded days of the year will be very expensive, but slower days are notably cheaper.\n\nDemand-based ticket pricing at Disney World and Disneyland would likely combine what we see with the current date- and tier-based ticket system and Lightning Lane\u2019s fluctuating day-by-day pricing changes based on demand.\n\nDemand-Based Pricing May Come to Disney World and Disneyland Soon\n\nRumors have been circulating that Disney World and Disneyland will switch from their current pricing systems to demand-based ticket pricing. And, based on the launch of this dynamic pricing model at Disneyland Paris, it is likely that the European parks are a test run for the U.S. parks.\n\nWith the uptick in chatter about demand-based pricing, it\u2019s likely that something is in the works for Disney World and Disneyland.\n\nHowever, Disney hasn\u2019t said anything about officially introducing demand-based pricing at Disney World or Disneyland. And we don\u2019t have any details about what that new pricing approach would look like for the two resorts.\n\nSince demand-based ticket pricing is already in action at Disneyland Paris, it\u2019s likely that Disney World and Disneyland would adopt a similar format. As a result, we can infer that if (or when) demand-based pricing comes to the U.S. theme parks, guests who want to purchase their tickets in advance will lock in their pricing. If you\u2019re planning a more last-minute or spur-of-the-moment visit, you\u2019ll want to check pricing carefully.\n\nBut ultimately, we won\u2019t fully know the ins and outs of demand-based pricing at Disney World or Disneyland \u2013 and understand the extent to which it impacts guests\u2019 trip planning \u2013 until it does roll out.\n\nWhile Disney has been talking about dynamic pricing since roughly 2018, odds are it\u2019s likely to be introduced around the time that price increases are typically unveiled. Over our many decades of visiting Disney World and Disneyland, we\u2019ve found those increases tend to take place in October.\n\nThis means demand-based pricing could be unveiled as soon as October 2025 for Disney World and Disneyland. However, we don\u2019t know if this new dynamic pricing model really is coming \u2013 and if it\u2019s coming in a few months or something in the next year or two.\n\nFor now, if you\u2019re planning a Disney World or Disneyland vacation, you can easily book under the existing date- and tier-based pricing system. And if you lock in your vacation now, you won\u2019t have to worry about any upcoming price increases or changes.\n\nNeed helping figuring out your plans and booking your Disney vacation?

This will include the first Audio-Animatronic version of Walt Disney when the show opens.\n\nThe opening of this show, along with the new exhibits in the Opera House lobby, is still quite some time off. However, there is something different to be seen rather than closed doors and a sign saying that work is being done. Daps Magic team member Steven discovered on Saturday morning that the sign that used to be on display above the Opera House has been removed. This is presumably so that it can be updated with the new show title. Previously, the sign said, \u201cThe Disneyland Story Presents Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.\u201d It would be unsurprising if any new sign that goes above the entrance to the Opera House referenced Walt Disney \u2013 A Magical Life.\n\nHere is a look at what the Opera House looks like now without the marquee over its entrance:\n\nAfter the initial run of Walt Disney \u2013 A Magical Life, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln will return and also be shown in the theater.

            "content": "Walt Disney (DIS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned -0.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nDisney is expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.6%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.47 points to a change of +10.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.13 indicates a change of +12% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Disney.",

Now, that section of displays closest to the theater have been removed, likely to make way for something new.\n\nCurrently, the film being screened inside the theater is the timeless \u201cOne Man\u2019s Dream,\" telling the story of Walt Disney in his own words. Seeing this film in this space where it originally debuted is a rare occasion, since the theater typically plays host to sneak peeks of upcoming films.\n\nWe anticipate, though it is unconfirmed, that this is being done to make way for a sneak peek of the upcoming live-action adaptation, Snow White. The significance of the adaptation of Walt\u2019s first full-length animated feature screams for some kind of exhibit and sneak peek in this space dedicated to Walt Disney himself.\n\nPreviously, this area played host to costumes from the hit Disney Channel film, Descendants: The Rise of Red, and various maquettes and sculpts from Pixar\u2019s Inside Out 2 and Disney Animation\u2019s Moana 2. The Moana 2 maquettes can still be found nearby.\n\nOriginally opened to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Walt\u2019s birth, the gallery showcases his life story from small-town America to Hollywood and lets guests explore a treasure trove of one-of-a-kind sketches, photos, models, costumes, artwork and more.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to visit this experience for yourself and the rest of Walt Disney World, be sure to reach out to our friends at Mouse Fan Travel who can assist with all your Disney Travel needs.",

This live-action adaptation, directed by Marc Webb ((500) Days of Summer) and co-written by Greta Gerwig (Barbie) and Erin Cressida Wilson (Secretary), has a lot of potential to bring in generations of mother-and-daughter Disney fans, particularly given the relative lack of family-oriented competition that typically comes with a mid-March release date; two previous live action Disney remakes (Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella) have hit theaters in that window.\n\nTheatrically Released Disney Animation Reimaginings\n\nTitle Release Date Domestic Opening Domestic Total The Lion King 7/19/19 $191.7M $543.6M Beauty and the Beast 3/17/17 $174.7M $504M Alice in Wonderland 3/5/10 $116.1M $334.1M The Jungle Book 4/15/16 $103.2M $364M The Little Mermaid 5/26/23 $95.5M $298.1M Aladdin 5/24/19 $91.5M $355.5M Maleficent 5/30/14 $69.4M $241.4M Cinderella 3/13/15 $67.8M $201.1M Dumbo 3/29/19 $45.9M $114.7M Maleficent: Mistress of Evil 10/18/19 $36.9M $113.9M Mufasa: The Lion King 12/20/24 $35.4M $242.3M Alice Through the Looking Glass 5/27/16 $26.8M $77M Pete\u2019s Dragon 8/12/16 $21.5M $76.2M Cruella 3/28/21 $21.4M $86.1M\n\nIn the month leading up to Disney\u2019s Snow White\u2019s debut, there will have been two major titles vying for the family market: Lionsgate\u2019s Unbreakable Boy, largely marketed to the faith-based crowd, and Sony\u2019s Paddington in Peru, like Disney\u2019s Snow White a live-action/animation hybrid centering on a legacy children\u2019s character. Despite opening at a lower-than-expected $12.7M, Paddington\u2018s holdover haul could nibble away at Disney\u2019s Snow White come mid-March should positive momentum develop; however, if that didn\u2019t happen for 2018\u2019s Paddington 2\u2014a critical and audience darling that was nonetheless unable to course-correct after a disappointing box office debut\u2014it probably won\u2019t happen for Pads this time around.\n\nThat said, all isn\u2019t necessarily joyous singing wildlife and happily-ever-after for Disney\u2019s Snow White. Disney\u2019s audience habits have evolved significantly since the peak of their animation remakes during the 2010s, when four titles\u2014The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Alice in Wonderland, and The Jungle Book\u2014opened above $100M domestically. Perhaps the sharpest evidence of this is the chasm between the respective domestic openings of 2024\u2019s Mufasa: The Lion King ($35.4M) and 2019\u2019s The Lion King ($191.7M).\n\nBeing a remake of a Disney classic, rather than a sequel to a remake of a Disney classic, Disney\u2019s Snow White has the edge over Mufasa in terms of box office potential. (Among this run of Disney remakes, the sequels\u2014Mufasa: The Lion King, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, and Alice Through the Looking Glass\u2014have to-date all come in under their predecessors.) But nostalgia won\u2019t be enough to carry Disney\u2019s Snow White past $100M in its opening weekend. Star Rachel Zegler (20th Century Studios/Disney\u2019s West Side Story; Lionsgate\u2019s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes; and Warner Bros.\u2019 Shazam! Fury of the Gods, the last of these also a mid-March release) has yet to open a movie above $50M, though her Hunger Games prequel ($44.6M domestic opening, $166.3M domestic total) had strong enough legs to keep it in the domestic top ten from its week-before-Thanksgiving release through the New Year\u2019s long weekend. Earlier in 2023, Disney\u2019s The Little Mermaid remake enjoyed a similar trajectory, opening roughly on-par with expectations before enjoying a leggy theatrical run that saw it out-earn comparable releases with similar or higher opening weekends.",

            "content": "That vision appears to be threatened by President Trump, who signed a sweeping executive order Wednesday night to all but eliminate certain federal agencies, including the Presidio Trust.\n\nThe trust, which Congress formed in 1996 to manage and protect the historic 1,500-acre park that looks out on the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay, is one of four agencies named in the \u201cReduction of the Federal Bureaucracy\u201d order, which calls for shrinking agencies that the administration deems \u201cunnecessary\u201d to \u201cminimize government waste and abuse.\u201d They have been ordered to eliminate their non-statutory operations \u201cto the maximum extent consistent with applicable law\u201d and reduce their statutory function to the minimum required by law.\n\n\u201cThe Presidio Trust is statutory, and it has been protected from assaults over time by its statutory strength,\u201d Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D\u2013San Francisco) said in a statement Wednesday night. \u201cWe will be carefully reviewing the language of the President\u2019s executive order and its purpose.\u201d\n\nThe order also targets the Inter-American Foundation, the United States African Development Foundation, and the United States Institute of Peace.\n\nWhether the order will face legal contest wasn\u2019t immediately clear Thursday, but Californians have already mounted multiple fights against Trump in court since he took office.\n\nSan Francisco Supervisor Stephen Sherrill, who represents the park area, said that while it\u2019s still unclear exactly what the order will do, he is working with the trust and local lawmakers to protect the Presidio.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that this does is create completely unnecessary fear,\u201d he told KQED. \u201cI\u2019ll be incredibly supportive of our city attorneys and of our federal officials in pushing back at this. We have to remember there are 3,000 San Francisco residents that live in the Presidio. These are my constituents; this is deeply, deeply personal to me and to my neighbors.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday in the park, Elizabeth Bradburn\u2019s goldendoodle Charles was among about a dozen running off-leash.\n\n\u201cWe definitely bring the dog here and meet other dog parents and families,\u201d she said, adding that her family often brings visiting friends down to see the bridge and eat at restaurants in the Presidio. \u201cI think it\u2019s a destination spot for a lot of people from outside of San Francisco, but then we who live here also use it regularly on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. military\u2019s Base Realignment and Closure process in the 1990s shuttered a number of old Army bases, including the one that used to occupy the Presidio land. It could have become a national park at the time, said Jim Wunderman, who was working for San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan, but the Republican-led federal government pushed back.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer opened Monday\u2019s Mad Money episode with the observation that CEOs gathered at the NFL\u2019s Super Bowl game weren't just there for football. They were there to talk business, politics, and the economy. According to Cramer, their conversations revealed what\u2019s truly shaping corporate America\u2019s mindset right now, with the biggest one having to do with the current U.S. President:\n\n\"Nobody can figure out Donald Trump. These CEOs are baffled\u2026 They like that he's attacking the federal bureaucracy, but they don't understand why Elon Musk is wasting time on the small stuff.\"\n\nHe also noticed that they appear more relaxed, confident and bullish under the new regime, compared to the previous one under Biden.\n\n\"There\u2019s been a shocking amount of new business going on\u2026 CEOs no longer feel like the government is out to get them. Even Democratic donors can't believe how disrespected they were by the Biden White House.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that all CEOs think Wall Street valuations are stretched, although Cramer is still bullish.\n\n\u201cThey almost all think the stock market\u2019s too high, but their own stocks are too low. When I tell them the market\u2019s actually undervalued and I like their stocks, they nod. But they think I\u2019m a dreamer.\u201d\n\nFinally, of course, the big theme was around Trump\u2019s tariffs and their impact on the markets.\n\n\u201cThey all hate Trump\u2019s tariff plans. These CEOs think they\u2019re disorganized, don\u2019t make sense, won\u2019t raise money, and are terrible for business. They\u2019re free traders at heart and totally baffled by Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 18. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs The Walt Disney Company (DIS) the Best Wide Moat Stocks to Invest In?\n\nA packed theater of moviegoers watching a blockbuster film produced by the entertainment company.",

We felt the only way to truly experience this was to intertwine the stories.\u201d\n\nWhile Win or Lose is a \u201cfirst\u201d for Pixar, it was inspired by \u201cquite a few Disney/Pixar films,\u201d according to Hobson and Yates.\n\n\u201cBut if we have to pick a joint favorite that we both return to, it\u2019s The Incredibles \u2014 the boldness of the storytelling stands alone even today.\u201d\n\nIn terms of what the audience will take away from the new series, Hobson and Yates hope it helps viewers see the world through a different point-of-view.\n\n\u201cWin or Lose has always been about walking a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes and seeing life the way they see it,\u201d they said. \u201cWe hope the show gives people this opportunity in a way only animation can do. We also just hope you have a good time and relate to our characters.\u201d",

            "content": "NATICK, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--LEVEL99, an interactive, social entertainment experience known for its challenge rooms, with locations across the East Coast, will open its newest outpost, and first-ever Florida location, at Disney Springs West Side at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The opening at Disney Springs will mark LEVEL99\u2019s fifth location as it continues to grow and scale its footprint, targeting national expansion.\n\nBacked by Act III Holdings, the investment vehicle led by Panera founder and current CAVA Chair Ron Shaich, LEVEL99 is a first-of-its-kind destination for real-world, challenge-based, social entertainment for adults featuring over 50 physical and mental challenges set in artistic environments. Beyond the games themselves, LEVEL99 features best-in-class design, an award-winning culinary offering, and craft beverages that are worth the trip.\n\nDisney selected LEVEL99 after a comprehensive review of the location-based entertainment industry. LEVEL99\u2019s Disney location will add to the growing list of dining, shopping and entertainment options at Disney Springs, which features more than 150 shops, restaurants and family-friendly leisure activities.\n\nWith its third and fourth locations set to open in 2025 at Tysons Corner Center in Virginia and The Corbin Collection in West Hartford, Connecticut, LEVEL99 plans to open several more locations in the future, including Disney Springs.\n\n\u201cWe are defining the category and setting the standard for out-of-home, interactive entertainment,\u201d said LEVEL99 CEO and Founder Matthew DuPlessie, an MIT engineer and Harvard Business School graduate who leads the team behind LEVEL99. \u201cAfter spending two decades in the location-based entertainment industry, it became clear there was consumer demand for a concept like this \u2013 a real unmet need. Our vision is to make \u2018challenge rooms\u2019 a mainstream concept, and the opportunity to open at a marquee location like Disney Springs is the next step in our plans to expand the LEVEL99 brand nationally.\u201d\n\nConsidered by most to be the inventor of today\u2019s modern escape room industry, DuPlessie launched the first escape room style concept in the world in 2004. He opened the first LEVEL99 location in 2021 after contemplating for years how to build a more durable and broadly appealing experience that combined all the mechanics people love about video games with creative physical and mental challenges that could be repeatedly enjoyed in a competitive, real-life, social setting.\n\nLEVEL99\u2019s proprietary entertainment offerings are developed in the company\u2019s game design studio where creators and engineers dream up and produce a variety of new challenges every year to keep the experience fresh and ever changing.\n\n\u201cWe see immense potential in what the LEVEL99 team has built and are excited to bring the future of interactive entertainment and social gaming into the mainstream,\u201d said Ron Shaich, CEO and Managing Partner of Act III Holdings, the investment vehicle he founded to help companies scale into becoming nationally dominant brands. \u201cWhen Matt shared his vision for LEVEL99 with me seven years ago, I saw that this business had the potential to define a new category with enormous opportunity for growth on a national scale, making it an ideal investment for Act III.\u201d\n\nLEVEL99 has established a footprint in New England where it has experienced industry-leading guest traffic fueled by players driving on average over half an hour to visit. A typical experience at LEVEL99 includes at least 2-3 hours of entertainment play, followed by drinks and food at its scratch kitchen and bar, with some players staying all day. LEVEL99 features challenge rooms, where teams of 2-6 players work together to beat a themed physical or mental challenge that typically lasts 1-4 minutes; arena duels, dispersed throughout the gaming arena for player-vs.-player showdowns; and an art hunt, where players search for hidden glyphs amongst hundreds of pieces of commissioned, local art that are unique to every location.\n\nThe Disney Springs location will be LEVEL99\u2019s largest to date including the most entertainment options, with over 60 challenge rooms and duels. LEVEL99 will occupy over 45,000 square feet in a two-level venue that will host upwards of 1,000 players at a time in the interactive gaming and bar/dining space. A two-story bar serving handcrafted cocktails and local beers will serve as the centerpiece of this location, accompanied by its chef-crafted menu including LEVEL99\u2019s signature, award-winning, Detroit-style pizza.\n\nThis will be LEVEL99\u2019s only location serving the greater Orlando area, and the company plans to hire over 100 roles for its team there.\n\nTo learn more about LEVEL99, visit https://www.level99.com/ or follow us on LinkedIn.\n\nAbout LEVEL99\n\nLEVEL99 is a collection of first-of-its-kind entertainment venues offering proprietary face-to-face physical and mental interactive challenges, scratch kitchens, and handcrafted beverages for a complete sensory adventure.

            "content": "'Captain America: Brave New World' stars and Disney's Veteran Employees on service and storytelling\n\nLOS ANGELES -- As Anthony Mackie makes his big-screen debut as Captain America in Marvel Studios' new film \"Captain America: Brave New World,\" his first memory of the magic of storytelling floods back into his mind - a memory held close to his heart. He was in the second grade.\n\n\"It's an Australian fable, Waltzing Matilda,\" said Mackie. \"My friends and I got together in second grade and turned it into a play. We got a standing ovation, the first standing ovation of my life, at Gentilly Terrace elementary school... that made me want to be a storyteller.\"\n\nThat moment set him on a path that would lead to one of the most iconic roles in modern cinema. In Marvel Studios' \"Captain America: Brave New World,\" storytelling and service come together in a way that's more urgent than ever. For Mackie, Sam Wilson is more than a superhero. He's a veteran, a humanitarian, a leader.\n\n\"Sam Wilson's perspective as a veteran informs his role as Captain America in every way,\" said Mackie. \"The pedigree of the title Captain America comes with service work. His idea of being a service member is his family, his community. That shows the true idealistic nature of being an American.\"\n\nThis sentiment rings true with veteran employees across The Walt Disney Company. Retired U.S. Navy Captain Cappy Surette now a Senior Manager for Disney Experiences Public Affairs, reflects on how this version of Captain America represents real-world service members.\n\n\"Not all heroes wear capes. Sam has wings, but he still serves for love of country, love of community,\" said Surette.\n\nDanny Ramirez, who plays Joaquin Torres-the new Falcon-connects deeply with that message as well. \"I don't need to have all these other magical powers or supernatural forces,\" said Ramirez. \"The film represents veterans and how complicated the full narrative is around service. There are so many aspects of what it means to serve, and Sam Wilson embodies the heart of that experience.\"\n\nBut beyond the battlefields-real or fictional-there's something else at play here: hope. \"Captain America: Brave New World\" isn't just about the struggles of those who serve. It's about the strength they bring to the world, and how their stories shape the next generation.\n\nFor Surette, the connection between storytelling and military service runs deep. \"When I was reading comics growing up, I migrated towards Marvel because it had a sense of realism,\" said Surette. \"Those stories of good overcoming evil helped inspire me to join the military and serve our country in uniform.\"\n\nFollowing a career in the military, Surette was employed through The Walt Disney Company's \"Heroes Work Here\" initiative which has hired thousands of veterans across the company since its inception, one of them being ABC News Correspondent and veteran Stephanie Ramos.\n\nRamos talks about how she was able to transfer her skills between the military and journalism.\n\n\"I've been at The Walt Disney Company at ABC News for 10 years now,\" said Ramos. \"And I've been able to bring so many skills that I learned in the military to this broadcast career. But I'm not alone here.\"\n\nMonique Morales, a former Air Force mechanic, now works as a machinist at Disneyland.\n\n\"Coming out of the military is such a difficult time for so many service members,\" Morales said. \"But I am so thankful to Disney for the opportunity to make that transition seamless. I think I connect majorly with Sam Wilson because he is an Air Force veteran. I know that Captain America stands for integrity, honor, and justice, and he has always been a role model for me.\"\n\nThese success stories are possible due to the incredible work of the veterans who developed the program at The Walt Disney Company, including Kevin Preston - a senior manager of external engagement at Disney.\n\n\"You had a very high unemployment rate for people who have served in our military. And the question was raised in society that they voluntarily served our nation, and they return and they can't find a job,\" said Preston. \"That just does not make sense. While Disney, being the company it is, stepped into this boldly and said we need to help. And that was the birth of Heroes Work Here.\"\n\nAnother way for veterans to connect at Disney is via SALUTE, an employee group that fosters belonging for veterans, friends, families, and allies within the company.\n\n\"We have a variety of chapters across the company, and we create programming for our cast,\" said Ariel Elias, a United States Marine Corps veteran, a who is now a manager at Disneyland Resort and the Co-Chair of the program there. \"Maybe it's a VA (Veterans Affairs) mortgage workshop. Maybe it's a volunteer event with the USO (United Services Organization). Maybe it's an opportunity to go watch Captain America and have a watch party.\"\n\nAn avid fan of Captain America, Elias appreciates the work Marvel has done to create a character that real-life veterans can identify with.\n\n\"I don't have any superpowers. Our servicemen and women don't have any superpowers. Yet we're expected to perform at such a high level,\" said Elias. \"And we try to do that every single day. What better way to represent our service men and women than to represent them with Sam Wilson.\"\n\nThe legacy of Captain America extends beyond comic books and movies-it's woven into the stories of those who have dedicated their lives to service, in and out of uniform.\n\n\"When people go see this film, I want them to walk away feeling hopeful because Captain America and Falcon, they exist,\" said Ramos. \"They're out there. They're in the military. They're in our communities. They're the ones making a difference.\"\n\nMackie puts it simply: \"To veterans watching this movie: Thank you so much. Your service does not go unnoticed. And your service is very appreciated.\"\n\nSome heroes wear capes. Some heroes have wings. Some, like Sam Wilson, serve in ways that don't require either. Their impact, however, is as powerful as any superpower.\n\nDon't miss Marvel Studios' Captain America: Brave New World Now Playing Only in Theaters.\n\nWatch ABC's On The Red Carpet Storytellers Spotlight special, Dear Captain America, with Anthony Mackie, Danny Ramirez and Disney's Veteran Employees in the video player above.

These shifts are reportedly intended to be voluntary and typically include a private room where the employees can sleep. Cast members told the publication they did not receive these accommodations while working ahead of Milton.\n\nSome who worked full shifts Wednesday reportedly said they did so because they feared losing out on pay by clocking out early. Others told the publication they stayed despite wishing they had time to get gas and groceries ahead of the storm.\n\nA spokesperson for Disney told The National News Desk thousands of employees volunteered for \"ride out\" shifts and other recovery efforts, adding that any employees whose shifts were impacted by park closures received disruption pay.\n\n\n\nEmployees reportedly said the Disney parks run a points-based demerit system for missed shifts with little leeway for extreme scenarios. Those who accumulate a significant number of points are allegedly at risk of being fired.\n\nYour house could be underwater, and they would be like, 'Well, call out and take the point,'\" an employee reportedly explained.\n\nA spokesperson for Disney said the company always prioritizes the safety of its employees.\n\n\"Safety is always our first and most important factor when making decisions that will affect our cast members and guests,\" the spokesperson said. \"And throughout the storm, we provided frequent and timely updates on our changes to make sure they returned home hours before the worst of the weather reached Central Florida.\"\n\nNearby attractionsUniversal Orlando and SeaWorld also shuttered ahead of the storm.

            "content": "Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in The Walt Disney Company ( ). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Walt Disney\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Chairman of the Board James Gorman for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$106 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$110. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the Walt Disney insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.\n\nOver the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 31.76k shares worth US$3.1m. On the other hand they divested 4.40k shares, for US$466k. Overall, Walt Disney insiders were net buyers during the last year.

By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nWalt Disney is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free\n\nInsider Ownership Of Walt Disney\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Walt Disney insiders own 0.02% of the company, worth about US$46m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Walt Disney Insiders?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Walt Disney shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Insiders own shares in Walt Disney and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Walt Disney has we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

For guests who don't want to pay extra, that means either waking up early to attempt to join the virtual queue at 7 a.m. or trying again from within each ride's respective park at 1 p.m. Guests then need to wait on their virtual queue boarding group to be called to enjoy the ride.\n\nSingle, Multi or Premier? Your guide to Disney World's Lightning Lane passes\n\nMoving to a traditional standby queue not only eliminates the chance of missing out on the rides entirely but also gives guests more flexibility in planning their park days. Some guests have been asking for this change.\n\nOnce it takes effect, there will be no virtual queues operating at Disney World. Every attraction will be available through a standby line.\n\nGuardians is the most popular ride at EPCOT. Guests who don't want a long wait can still buy a Lighting Lane Single Pass for the attraction.

On June 8, 2025 it will close permanently to make way for construction of the new Monsters, Inc. themed land. And, while the Monsters are displacing the Muppets from this part of the park and bringing an end to the last major project Muppets creator Jim Henson personally worked on, the Muppets will be displacing Aerosmith from Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster at some point in the future that we very well could hear some attraction closing dates for in the coming months. Next door to the coaster, the new show Disney Villains: Unfairly Ever After is scheduled to debut this summer as well.\n\n\u2026For those wondering what will become of the building next to Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios that was the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser, Disney confirmed last month that Walt Disney Imagineering will be using it for offices.\n\n\u2026Inside the Tree of Life at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, It\u2019s Tough to Be a Bug will close forever on March 17, 2025, to make way for Zootopia: Better Zoogether! which is expected to open in \u201cwinter 2025.\u201d In Disney announcement terms, that means our last opportunity to see the show is March 16.\n\nIn \u201cWinter 2025,\u201d the Tree of Life Theatre will become home to \u201cZootopia: Better Zoogether.\u201d Our last chance to see It\u2019s Tough to Be a Bug is March 16, 2025. The show was running during the recent DVC Moonlight Magic event, February 12, so that was probably my last viewing of it. Photo by Alan S. Dalinka.\n\n\u2026 REMINDER . The first phase of closures in DinoLand U.S.A. at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom to make way for the Tropical Americas land scheduled to open in 2027, got underway on January 13, 2025. TriceraTop Spin, the Fossil Fun Games, and the Chester & Hester\u2019s Dinosaur Treasures gift shop are all now closed forever. The rest of DinoLand USA, including the DINOSAUR attraction and Restaurantosaurus remain open for now, but will eventually close as the Tropical Americas construction expands. Disney has said as to DINOSAUR in particular, \u201c2025 is your year to visit before it goes extinct!\u201d Folks around the web and social media have taken that to mean that the attraction will remain open throughout the year before it closes to be reimagined as a new Indiana Jones adventure. That is certainly one interpretation of that announcement, and, if the development of the Tropical Americas land does not move at a rapid pace, it very well could be that DINOSAUR continues operations into 2026; we do know for sure that the attraction is on a countdown to extinction.\n\n\u2026Even with all the closures at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, there have been some occasional debuts among the animal inhabitants. Unfortunately, Maharajah Jungle Trek closes more than an hour before the park does, so when I ventured over for Moonlight Magic, there was not an opportunity to try to get a look in person.\n\nWelcome home \ud83c\udf33 Bakso has made his debut at Animal Kingdom \ud83d\udc2f pic.twitter.com/aJqgSkq1mP \u2014 Disney Parks (@DisneyParks) January 29, 2025\n\n\u2026 REMINDER . Still speaking of closures, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Magic Kingdom has closed for its year-long refurbishment. Social media reports this week showed new track for the attraction arriving at the park. Since Disney has announced its significant park expansion projects beyond BTM, we expect this refurbishment project could also lay the groundwork for that further expansion, but Disney has not elaborated as yet. We excpect that the Walt Disney World Railroad at Magic Kingdom will need to close to make way for the expansion project, but Disney has not yet announced a closing date for it and the My Disney Experience app shows it operating during its usual hours.\n\n\u2026Another player that won the Super Bowl had his \u201cI\u2019m going to Disney World\u201d moment this past week.

            "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$118 and falling to the lows of US$101. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Walt Disney's current trading price of US$110 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Walt Disney\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Walt Disney\n\nWhat Is Walt Disney Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Walt Disney seems to be fairly priced at around 2.7% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Walt Disney today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $113.43, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Walt Disney\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Walt Disney generate?\n\nNYSE:DIS Earnings and Revenue Growth February 17th 2025\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Walt Disney's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? DIS\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on DIS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.",

            "content": "A filmmaker is suing Disney over copyright infringement of the \"Moana\" franchise, claiming the films show several similarities to an idea he had worked on years ago.\n\nBuck Woodall, a writer, producer and artist, filed a lawsuit on Friday, Jan. 10, claiming The Walt Disney Company, an independent film company called Mandeville Films and Jenny Marchick, who was named head of feature development for DreamWorks Animation in 2020, stole his ideas to create \"Moana.\" The lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, follows the release of \"Moana 2,\" which hit theaters in November 2024.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Woodall claims he is entitled to \"at least $10 billion\" in damages and 2.5% of gross revenue earned by Disney from the \"Moana 2\" film and related merchandise, which he claims would be \"at least $5 billion.\"\n\nThe original \"Moana\" movie, released in 2016, tells the story of a teenager on a mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) meets a demigod named Maui (Dwyane Johnson) who guides her though an action-packed voyage. \"Moana 2\" follows Moana and Maui after Moana receives a surprising call from her ancestors.\n\nBoth movies were box office hits, with the more recent film bringing in $221 million during its five-day domestic debut, according to Disney, which set a record for the largest Thanksgiving weekend haul in history, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company nor NBC Universal, which owns DreamWorks Animation, immediately responded when contacted for comment about the lawsuit by USA TODAY.\n\nHere's what to know about the lawsuit.\n\nLawsuit describes 'breathtaking' similarities\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Woodall claims that \"Moana\" and \"Moana 2\" are a direct rip of his original animated film called \"Bucky the Wave Warrior\" or \"Bucky,\" which was inspired by his \"unique exposure\" to Polynesian culture.\n\nWoodall claims the films have \"breathtaking\" similarities, including a story that centers around a teenager on a dangerous voyage to save a Polynesian island, representations of Polynesian ancestors through animal spirits, a symbolic necklace that plays a special role in the story, and a demigod with a giant hook and tattoo who helps the protagonist, to name just a few.\n\nPer the lawsuit, around 2003, Woodall began sharing his ideas for \"Bucky\" with Jenny Marchick, who at the time was the director of development at Mandeville Films, an independent film production studio in California. Marchick allegedly told Woodall that the production studio held a \"first look\" deal with Disney, meaning Mandeville could provide exclusive previews to Disney for purchase, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWoodall claims that over the course of several years, Marchick \"prodded\" him for additional \"Bucky\" content, including an animated trailer, storyboards and a draft script, of which he provided.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Marchick told Woodall on the \"eve of the release of 'Moana'\" that she was unsure if his \"Bucky\" materials \"made it beyond her desk.\" But Woodall claims that upon delivering his final script to Marchick in 2011, those materials were already in the hands of Disney for the creation of the first \"Moana\" film.\n\nWoodall, per the lawsuit, registered \"Bucky\" assets, including a trailer, with the Writers Guild of America, and it was granted federal copyright protections in 2004, which were updated in 2014.\n\nWoodall is seeking a jury trial for the lawsuit.\n\nContributing: Brendan Morrow, USA TODAY\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Sadly, this project was canceled, but another hotel is set to take its place.\n\nReflections\u2014A Disney Lakeside Lodge was announced in 2018, and the land started to be cleared and construction walls went up for the new hotel. However, one year later, in 2019, Disney seemed to erase any mention of this new resort, changing its D23 Expo announcements blog post and removing all mentions of Reflections\u2014A Disney Lakeside Lodge.\n\nFast-forward to 2024, and we still did not know the fate of this resort; it seemed that it would be canceled for good, and that was until the end of 2024 when we got some exciting news. The land that was set to be used for Reflections\u2014A Disney Lakeside Lodge would be used for a new hotel called Disney\u2019s Lakeshore Lodge. This new Disney Vacation Club resort is set to open in 2027, although no exact date has been announced.\n\nAlthough Disney has not released many details, they shared that the resort \u201cwill be inspired by the majesty of nature and its enduring influence on Disney artists.\u201d From past concept art released by Disney, it seems that some of Disney\u2019s intellectual property will be used in the theming, as we spotted Bambi, Thumper, and Flower.\n\nConstruction seems to be moving along, which gives us hope that this resort will actually come to fruition. We recently spotted cranes working at the hotel\u2019s future site.\n\nWe also got a birds-eye view of the construction thanks to @bioreconstruct.\n\nAnother look at the construction.\n\nUntil this resort opens in 2027, The Island Tower at Disney\u2019s Polynesian Villas & Bungalows, which is also a Disney Vacation Club resort, will hold the title as the newest Disney World hotel as it opened in December of 2024.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait for Disney to release more details as well as concept art for this new project, so make sure to stay tuned with AllEars, as we will keep an eye out!\n\nJoin the AllEars.net Newsletter to get the free Cheat Sheet for Disney's Wilderness Lodge & Animal Kingdom Lodge!

            "content": "As Walt Disney once predicted, Disneyland will \"never be completed.\" It will continue growing \"as long as there is imagination left in the world.\" Disney's original theme park in Anaheim, California, is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year, and there's a lot of new rides, experiences and shows on the horizon -- both at Disneyland and at its 53-year-old counterpart in Florida, Walt Disney World.\n\nFrom new rides and new lands to huge park expansions, here's everything new coming to Disney Parks and the Disney Cruise Line in 2025 and beyond.\n\nDisneyland's 70th anniversary\n\nConcept art of how Sleeping Beauty Castle will look at Disneyland during the 70th celebration. Artist Concept/Disneyland Resort\n\nKicking off in mid-May is Disneyland's 70th birthday celebration. The original Disney park opened on July 17, 1955, but the birthday celebration begins two months early, on May 16, and continues for more than a year, running through summer 2026.\n\n\"Celebrate happy\" is the theme, and new events will include a Mickey and Friends cavalcade (including Duffy and ShellieMay); a projection show at It's a Small World called \"Tapestry of Happiness\" (as well as Miguel and Dante being added to the ride!) and a projection show at Carthay Circle; new outfits for Mickey and friends; and the World of Color Happiness show. The new World of Color show will be hosted by Joy from Inside Out, with the other Emotions manifesting movie moments from Pixar and Disney films including The Incredibles, Turning Red, A Goofy Movie, Encanto and Tangled.\n\nThe esplanade between Disneyland and California Adventure will be getting a 50-foot sculpture of Sleeping Beauty Castle, with more decorations sprinkled throughout Downtown Disney and Main Street USA, as well as inside Disney's hotels. There will even be 70th anniversary decor included in the Toy Story Midway Mania ride.\n\nConcept art of the 70th anniversary decor in Toy Story Midway Mania. Artist Concept/Disneyland Resort\n\nThe Paint the Night parade, Pixar Pals parade and Wondrous Journeys fireworks show will also be returning for the celebration.\n\nOn the official anniversary day of July 17, Disneyland will debut a new verse for It's A Small World, as well as a three-minute film called The Last Verse in the Main Street Cinema. The movie celebrates the Sherman Brothers, who wrote the music for the ride. There will also be a new gallery exhibition in the Opera House on Main Street USA, featuring never-before-seen images, art and artifacts from the development, opening and evolution of Disneyland. These include the original rocking chair, lamp and table from Walt Disney's private apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street; Walt's 1955 Emmy award; and his Presidential Medal of Freedom from 1964. There will be a second exhibit on the history of animatronics.\n\nThe first ever audio-animatronic figure of Walt Disney himself, as part of the Walt Disney: A Magical Life show inside the Main Street Opera House, will also debut on July 17.\n\nHow much are Disneyland tickets for the 70th celebration?\n\nAnother big drawcard for the 70th anniversary celebrations: ticket pricing.\n\nIf you're visiting Disneyland between May 16 and Aug. 14, 2025, you can buy tickets that are part of the Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer. These will cost $360 for a three-day, one-park-per-day ticket, or $400 for a four-day, one-park-per-day ticket.\n\nAvengers Campus is getting two more rides\n\nThe Avengers Infinity Defense ride Disney\n\nDisney's California Adventure, already home to the Spider-Man Web Slingers and Guardians of the Galaxy attractions in the Avengers Campus area of the park, will be getting two more Marvel attractions.\n\nDuring SXSW over the weekend, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, Imagineering chief creative officer Bruce Vaughn and Iron Man himself, Robert Downey Jr., revealed more details about these two new rides. Avengers Infinity Defense will see you assemble alongside the Avengers battling King Thanos, featuring appearances by Black Panther, Ant-Man and Hulk. Stark Flight Lab, the second ride, will see you help test Tony Stark's latest tech.\n\n\"In Stark Flight Lab, guests will sit in 'gyro-kinetic pods' and roll along a track before stopping in front of a giant robot arm,\" Disney explains on its Parks Blog. \"This robot arm will hoist you into the air where you'll make several high-speed maneuvers inspired by Iron Man and some other Avengers.\"\n\nConstruction begins this year on the Avengers Campus additions.\n\nA first look at the Pixar Cars rally race\n\nThe new Cars rally race ride. Disney\n\nThe Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island at Disney World's Magic Kingdom are being repurposed to add an area themed around Pixar's Cars movies. This expansion of Frontierland, which currently encompasses Tiana's Bayou Adventure and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, will get a Route 66 companion.\n\n\"To make way for this completely new frontier, the Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island will be transformed into vast and rugged terrains for a rally race with some of the world's most iconic racers,\" Disney said in a blog post last year.\n\nSXSW this past weekend also saw Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter and Imagineer Michel Hundgen talk about the new ride vehicle being invested for the Cars ride. You can watch a TikTok video of Disney Imagineers testing out off-road vehicles in the desert in Arizona in an effort to create what the ride will feel like.\n\n\"These are all things Lightning McQueen and Mater haven't experienced before, like racing over rocky terrain, ascending to mountain peaks, and dodging around geysers \u2014 how do you take these real-world elements and put a Cars spin on it?\" Disney Parks says in a blog post. Docter added that each rally car will have its own personality, name and racing number.\n\nDisney last year said there will be a second Cars-themed attraction, too. Cars Land, which was added to Disney's California Adventure back in 2012, remains popular in the west, so it was only a matter of time before it was added to the east. Work is set to begin this year, though there's no closing date yet for Tom Sawyer Island or the Liberty Square Riverboat.\n\nMonsters Inc. land and ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios\n\nDisney's first suspended roller coaster will take you on a ride through the Monsters Inc. factory. Disney/Pixar\n\nAnother new addition coming to Disney World at its Hollywood Studios theme park is a Monsters Inc.-themed area, to replace the current Muppets area (with the Muppets to replace Aerosmith theming in the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster).\n\nRevealed by the voice of Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), the land will let you stroll through Monstropolis from the Pixar movies and shorts. A new ride will also take you through the Monsters Inc. laugh factory aboard one of the doors to the human world \u2014 aka a suspended roller coaster.\n\n\"The first time I saw Monsters, Inc., all I wanted to do was ride on one of those doors like Mike and Sulley,\" D'Amaro said at D23 in August. \"You'll go into the factory and experience the first suspended coaster ever in a Disney park. Remember in the movie how those claws grab the doors and hoist them up into the air to take them away? We're doing that, too. And you're going along for the ride.\"\n\nDocter and Hundgen were also on-hand to talk about the new Monsters Inc. ride during SXSW, which \"will feature the first-ever suspended coaster at a Disney Park, and the first-ever vertical lift.\" The loading area will see you board the ride vehicle and then \"hoisted into the air.\" Here's the TikTok showing the design concept for the Monsters Inc. ride.\n\nYour last day to enjoy MuppetVision 3D is June 7. It'll close permanently on June 8. Work on the Monsters Inc. land will then begin later in 2025. There's no closing date yet for the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster.\n\nCalifornia Adventure is getting a Coco attraction\n\nConcept art for the new Coco ride. Disney/Pixar\n\nDisney's California Adventure is also getting more Pixar rides.\n\nA Coco attraction will be built in a yet-to-be-announced area of the park, but it sounds like it'll be a dark ride like Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, populated by Audio-Animatronics.\n\n\"The attraction will be filled with the characters \u2014 and music! \u2014 you know and love from the beloved movie, as you join Miguel on a trip to the land of the dead,\" Disney says.\n\nWork begins on the Coco ride in 2026, so its launch is still a while away.\n\nBluey says hello at Disneyland and Disney World\n\nMeet and greets with Bluey and her family will be coming to Disneyland and Disney World, as well as to Disney cruises, starting at an unspecified time in 2025. Disney announced this news after revealing that a Bluey movie will be hitting screens in 2027.\n\n\"Bluey has become a household name for families around the world, and we are thrilled to bring her story to life in new ways,\" said Disney Experiences Chair Josh D'Amaro. \"We can't wait to watch our youngest guests and their families make memories with Bluey in our parks and on our cruises.\"\n\nThe hugely popular Australian TV series about a family of dogs is a worldwide hit, with Disney to release the movie in two years' time. (In the meantime, you can watch Bluey episodes and minisodes on Disney Plus.)\n\nAn Avatar area is coming to Disneyland\n\nAn aerial shot of the Avatar-themed area coming to Disneyland Resort. Disney\n\nThe world of Pandora is expanding from Disney World's Animal Kingdom in Orlando to California Adventure in Anaheim. The area in California will take its design inspiration from the second Avatar film, The Way of Water, as well as the upcoming Avatar sequels.\n\nIt'll likely be part of the enormous Disneyland expansion coming to the theme parks that will push the boundaries past Downtown Disney and into the nearby parking lots. While Disney was short on details and dates, the Avatar experience will be \"dynamic, intense and emotional,\" with a dark boat ride much like Pirates of the Caribbean \"taking guests all the way to the wide-open seas of Pandora.\"\n\nDisney World's Magic Kingdom Villains Land\n\nDisney World's Magic Kingdom is getting a Villains Land. Disney\n\nVillains Land, which will celebrate all the classic baddies from Disney films, is coming to the Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, and it will be \"dark and thorny,\" according to the Horizons Disney Experiences Showcase (part of Disney's D23 expo in August) and info that Disney has released since.\n\nVillains Land was first teased during D23 2022. It'll be positioned on the other side of Big Thunder Mountain \u2014 aka, the top left edge of the current Magic Kingdom map \u2014 and will stretch around to where the Haunted Mansion is.\n\nTwo major attractions will be built in Villains Land, as well as dining and shopping \"on an incredibly twisted grand scale.\" The land is already being constructed, but no word yet on when it'll open.\n\nA chilling trailer for the chaotic land on Instagram hints at elements in the land representing Maleficent, Dr. Facilier, Ursula, Gaston, Yzma, Queen of Hearts, Hades, the Evil Queen, Lady Tremaine, Captain Hook, Jafar, Kaa, Madam Mim, Cruella, Scar, King Magnifico and Mother Gothel.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this: Disney Parks Announcements at D23 03:24\n\nTropical Americas land at Animal Kingdom\n\nDisney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World is replacing its DinoLand USA area with Tropical Americas. Though this had been previously announced, Disney confirmed a few more details in August: Pueblo Esperanza will feel like you're walking through a real village and will have a huge quick-service dining location, a fountain and a carousel.\n\nTropical Americas will also have a new Indiana Jones ride through a Maya temple and an Encanto-themed attraction where you'll explore Antonio's rainforest room inside the Casita.\n\nConstruction began in fall 2024, but DinoLand USA is closing down in stages. The Dinosaur ride (which will become the Indiana Jones ride) remains open, but TriceraTop Spin and the midway area closed down on Jan. 13.\n\nTropical Americas is planned to open in 2027.\n\nThe Tropical Americas area will replace DinoLand USA and feature an Encanto ride, an Indiana Jones ride and a carousel. Disney\n\nFour more ships for Disney Cruise Line\n\nIn addition to the Disney Wish, which launched in July 2022, the Disney Treasure, which set sail in December 2024, and the Disney Destiny, which is set to embark later this year, Disney is adding four more cruise ships to its ocean vacation lineup.\n\nThe ship names and destinations have yet to be revealed, but the ships will be setting sail between 2027 and 2031.\n\nDisney World and Disneyland: what else is coming?\n\nMando and Grogu are joining in the Millennium Falcon fun.

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nUb Iwerks (born March 24, 1901, Kansas City, Mo., U.S.\u2014died July 7, 1971, Burbank, Calif.) was an American animator and special-effects technician who, among many other achievements, brought the world-renowned cartoon character Mickey Mouse to life.\n\nIwerks was the son of an immigrant German barber. When he was 18 years old, he met and befriended Walt Disney, a fellow employee at the Pesman-Rubin Commercial Art Studio in Kansas City. After an unsuccessful attempt to go into business for themselves in 1920, the two young artists went to work at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, which produced animated advertisements for local movie theatres. Iwerks and Disney complemented each other perfectly; Iwerks was a phenomenally fast and flexible artist, while Disney was a creative visionary with a remarkable talent for salesmanship.\n\nSteamboat Willie, 1928 The animated Steamboat Willie (1928) was the first Mickey Mouse film to include sound. (more) See all videos for this article\n\nAfter setting up his own Hollywood cartoon studio in 1923, Disney invited Iwerks to join the organization the following year. When the distributor of Disney\u2019s popular Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon series raided Disney\u2019s staff in 1927, only Iwerks remained loyal to his old Kansas City colleague. Forced to start over from scratch, the two men came up with a new cartoon character named Mickey Mouse. With Disney concentrating on gags and characterization and Iwerks handling the animation, the team scored a spectacular hit with their third Mickey Mouse film, the \u201call talkie\u201d Steamboat Willie (1928). Despite his harmonious relationship with Disney, Iwerks aspired to become an independent producer. Launching his own animation studio in 1930, he supervised dozens of entries in the Flip the Frog, Willie Whopper, and ComiColor Cartoons series. During this period he made several significant contributions to the art of animation photography, notably the multiplane camera, which created a three-dimensional effect on screen.\n\nBritannica Quiz Oscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nAlthough Iwerks\u2019s cartoons were artistically superb, they lacked the strong storylines and appealing characters that distinguished the Disney output. After closing his studio in 1936, Iwerks directed cartoons for other producers. In 1940 he returned to Disney\u2019s studios, where he would remain until his death. Given carte blanche to work on the technical developments that had always been his first priority, he made enormous advances in the field of optical printing and matte photography, seamlessly combining animation with live action in such Disney releases as Mary Poppins (1964). He also helped develop a number of the attractions for Disney\u2019s theme parks in California and Florida. Iwerks received Academy Awards for his technical achievements in 1960 and 1965 and an additional nomination for his special-effects work in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds (1963).",

The move breaks tradition with Pixar\u2019s typical Father\u2019s Day Weekend release window, and avoids going head-to-head with Universal\u2019s live-action reimagining of the DreamWorks hit How to Train Your Dragon (directed by franchise helmer Dean DeBlois).\n\nThe studio also removed or moved a few \u201cUntitled Disney\u201d slot reservations.\n\nThe shift for Elio will also expand the window for Disney\u2019s own live-action revamp, Lilo & Stitch, which opens May 23 and is directed by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Dean Fleisher Camp (Marcel the Shell with Shoes On). Elio is the only fully-animated major studio release between The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie (March 14; Ketchup Ent.) and Smurfs (July 18; Paramount).\n\nThe Mouse House seems to know what it\u2019s doing, coming off of 2024, when Disney titles secured the top three global box-office spots (Pixar\u2019s Inside Out 2, Marvel\u2019s Deadpool & Wolverine and Walt Disney Animation Studios\u2019 Moana 2).\n\nDirected by Madeline Sharafian (Burrow SparkShort), Domee Shi (Bao short, Turning Red) and Adrian Molina (co-screenwriter/co-director of Coco), and produced by Mary Alice Drumm (associate producer of Coco), Elio centers on an alien-obsessed kid who is mistaken for the leader of Earth and transported to the interplanetary \u201cCommuniverse,\u201d where he forges extraterrestrial friendships and helps avert an interplanetary crisis.\n\nDisney\u2019s upcoming animation and related films include:\n\nSnow White (live action) \u2013 March 21\n\nLilo & Stitch (live action) \u2013 May 23\n\nElio (Pixar) \u2013 June 20\n\nZootopia 2 (Disney) \u2013 November 26\n\nHoppers (Pixar) \u2013 March 6, 2026\n\nToy Story 5 (Pixar) \u2013 June 19, 2026\n\nMoana (live action) \u2013 July 10, 2026\n\nIce Age 6 (20th Century Animation) \u2013 December 18, 2026\n\nFrozen III (Disney) \u2013 November 24, 2027\n\n[Source: Deadline]",

            "content": "Marvel Studios\u2019 Captain America: Brave New World soars into theaters this weekend, and with it comes the next chapter in the adventure of the Star-Spangled Man.\n\nThe new film continues the story of Sam Wilson (played by Anthony Mackie), as he battles enemies both home and abroad as the new high-flying Captain America. Wilson also has to deal with the newly-elected President Thaddeus \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross (played by Harrison Ford) and his bright red alter ego.\n\nNate Moore, producer of the film, is excited for audiences to see it, noting that one of the reasons to see Brave New World in theaters is because \u201cas much as it is a grounded tale about Sam Wilson grappling with being Captain America, it also has some of our most stunning visual effects and action sequences to date.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there is anything like the shared experience of seeing a film with an audience, together, projected on a big screen,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as technology has brought a lot of these stories into our homes, or even into our hands with the phones that we look at constantly, to be able to put your phone down, sit with friends, and to see images projected larger than life in front of you really allows yourself to be immersed into the story.\u201d\n\nWe spoke with Moore about the new film, the evolution of the Captain America franchise, and what it was like to have Disney Legend Harrison Ford join the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\n\nThere\u2019s been multiple Captain America films. What makes this one different?\n\nIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had a Captain America who is not a super-solider, which is what I think makes the character Sam Wilson so interesting. He can\u2019t rely on his incredible strength or stamina like Steve Rogers could, he has to rely on his humanity and the way that he connects with people to solve the problems of this movie. I think in some ways that makes this film the most grounded Captain America film we\u2019ve ever made \u2014 which is ironic to say considering there is a Red Hulk in the middle of it \u2014 but it really is about people, and how Sam can solve the problems that people have in this movie to diffuse a global situation.\n\nThe Falcon is a character you\u2019ve followed for most of your time at Marvel. What makes the character special to you?\n\nThe new Falcon, much like Sam is taking a step up into the role of Captain America, Joaquin Torres \u2014 who we met briefly in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier \u2014 gets to try out the moniker of the Falcon. What I think is cool about the Falcon is that even back in Winter Soldier he gets to be a true partner to Captain America, he gets to be a friend beyond a comrade, or a brothers-in-arms. I think the dynamic between Sam and Joaquin is like that, kind of for the first time of mentor-mentee, but also Joaquin gets to serve to some degree as Sam\u2019s conscience in the movie. It\u2019s really interesting because I think the Marvel heroes who resonate the most with audiences are the ones who are the most human and their relationship I feel like is incredibly grounded in a dynamic that most audiences can recognize.\n\nHarrison Ford is joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What does his inclusion mean for Marvel both in story and from an external perspective?\n\nFrom a story perspective Harrison Ford joining the MCU as Thaddeus Ross allows us to complete the arc of a character that started back in The Incredible Hulk. Thaddeus Ross has always been sort of a hard case obsessed with Hulks, and over the course of his time in the MCU we\u2019ve gotten to see different sides of him, whether that be the Secretary of State version in Civil War or the man who is chasing Natasha across the globe in Black Widow. But what\u2019s interesting about Thaddeus Ross in this movie is he\u2019s trying to come to grips with how the actions of his past have affected how he\u2019s perceived in the present, including his relationship with his daughter Betty Ross. Getting to see this character kind of come full circle from that first film and to some degree \u2014 no spoiler here \u2014 become the thing that he hated the most in the beginning is really interesting and I think gave Harrison something really cool to play.\n\nAnd look, as far as Harrison Ford the man, whenever you get to work with a Hollywood icon there is something special about that. And he is as advertised: he is charismatic, he is funny, he is an incredibly hard worker, and I think he brought new facets to the character that we didn\u2019t even see on the page, so we couldn\u2019t be more excited to have him join the MCU.\n\nWhat do you hope audiences take away from the new film?\n\nThis movie thematically, to some degree, is about finding common ground with people who are different from you, or who have had different experiences that have led them on trajectories that are not healthy. What I think the movie wants to be about is finding the common ground with people you don\u2019t agree with, and I think Sam Wilson, who started in the MCU as a counselor, is the right character to deliver that message, if there is such a thing. So I think if people take away that theme that we\u2019re more the same than different, but also have a really good time watching action sequences that are unlike anything they\u2019ve ever seen before, that would be the perfect sweet spot for this film.",

Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\n\nThe research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.\n\nZacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nYou want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Walt Disney (DIS)\n\nBurbank, CA-based Walt Disney Company has assets that span movies, television shows and theme parks. Revenues were $91.4 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nDIS is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\n\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. DIS has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 10.1% for the current fiscal year.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, seven analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $5.47 per share. DIS boasts an average earnings surprise of 12.7%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, DIS should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in The Walt Disney Company (DIS)?\n\nBefore you invest in The Walt Disney Company (DIS), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

The DEI changes, outlined in an email to staff on Tuesday, come as a growing number of U.S. companies and brands have rolled back similar initiatives following the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on DEI in the early weeks of his second term.\n\nThe content disclaimer \u2014 introduced in 2020 after consulting with groups including the African American Film Critics Association and the Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment \u2014 will no longer automatically play on older titles on Disney\u2019s streaming service, Disney Plus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current content advisory warns that the film includes \u201cnegative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures.\u201d It adds, \u201cThese stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d Native Americans are referred to by a racist slur, and in \u201cDumbo,\u201d a group of crows is caricatured using racist Black stereotypes.

And soon, as venerable U.S. President Thaddeus \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross, he\u2019ll have the entire world seeing red. In essence, Disney Legend Harrison Ford \u2014 the actor behind those beloved and iconic characters \u2014 has the range.\n\nIn an exclusive interview for the Spring 2025 digital cover story of Disney twenty-three, Ford said each role has revealed something about himself and, to a greater degree, the human experience. \u201cWe\u2019re all made from the same common clay. It\u2019s moment in time. It\u2019s opportunity \u2014 all of these inexplicable, unpredictable elements, plus our own drive and search for something useful to do in life,\u201d he explains. \u201cAll of it counts. Fantasy counts. Science counts. Reality counts. But being able to dream into and out of the world you\u2019re living in? That\u2019s important stuff.\u201d\n\nLast year, Ford was honored as a Disney Legend during D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event presented by Visa\u00ae, a rarefied distinction that both \u201cflattered\u201d and \u201cbemused\u201d him. While delivering his acceptance speech in front of fellow Disney Legends such as Angela Bassett, James Cameron, Miley Cyrus, and Frank Oz, Ford said \u201cnobody does anything in this business alone\u201d \u2014 a sentiment he echoes in his interview with Disney twenty-three.\n\n\u201cThe work that an actor, frankly, gets credit for is the work of many people who have come before him and laid in the groundwork for him to walk. The George Lucases, the Steven Spielbergs, the Kevin Feiges in my life are really responsible for the opportunities that I\u2019ve had,\u201d Ford said. \u201cTheir passion for the ideas they\u2019re working with and their commitment to the craft and to the quality and integrity of their work has been fundamental to the success of my career. You don\u2019t do this alone. You stand on the shoulders of many people.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, I\u2019m standing on the shoulders of [the late] William Hurt, who created the character that I\u2019m playing in this Marvel film,\u201d Ford said of his role in Marvel Studios\u2019 Captain America: Brave New World, in theaters February 14. \u201cI had an opportunity to see the foundations he established for the character, and it gave me a wonderful place to start with the responsibilities that I have storytelling-wise in this Captain America movie.\u201d\n\nThroughout his his decades-long career, Ford himself laid the groundwork for actors like Anthony Mackie \u2014 who plays Captain America \u2014 to become a movie star in his own right.\n\n\u201cI got to see the full-blown Anthony Mackie, and it is a considerable presence,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI\u2019d seen him outside of the Marvel Universe, and as an actor, he\u2019s formidable. He\u2019s a very powerful presence onscreen. Our scenes together were scenes of conflict, in most cases; I met him on the field, so I knew the steel he was made of as an actor. But he has more than steel in his quiver: he\u2019s got sensitivity, understanding, and intelligence about what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nIn the Spring 2025 issue of Disney twenty-three, Mackie is equally effusive about his co-star, going so far as to say he learned \u201cwhat it really means to be a movie star from Harrison Ford.\u201d\n\nWhat is Ford\u2019s reaction to hearing such a compliment? \u201c[I feel] a mixture of embarrassment and secret pleasure,\u201d Ford said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for his words.\u201d\n\nRead more about Captain America: Brave New World in the Spring 2025 issue of Disney twenty-three, available soon only to Gold Members of D23: The Official Disney Fan Club.

The experience is two hours long and includes a high-spirited, hilarious show and all-you-can-eat barbecue. On the menu at Hoop are delights like fried chicken, barbecue ribs, cornbread, salad, and macaroni and cheese. And, while the meal is so good you'll want to keep eating, it's important to save room for the best part: dessert. The strawberry shortcake at Hoop-Dee-Doo is incredible and it's always a highlight of my meal when I visit.\n\nHoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue's menu has everything from smoked, barbecue pork ribs to strawberry shortcake, and it's all all-you-can-eat.

There are few experiences on Disney World property that include alcohol in the cost, so if you're a fan of sipping adult beverages, this perk only adds to the value of Hoop-Dee-Doo.\n\nHow To Make A Reservation\n\nHoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue typically takes place three times a day at Fort Wilderness, with showtimes at 4:00, 6:15, and 8:30 p.m. There are lots of ways to get to Fort Wilderness, from taking Disney World bus transportation to driving your own car to using ferries or Minnie Vans\u2014Lyft-powered rideshares available for Disney guests. You'll need to arrive at Pioneer Hall 30 minutes prior to showtime for check-in, so be sure to allow for enough travel time.\n\nHoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue takes place at Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort inside Pioneer Hall. Terri Peters\n\nThis Disney World dinner show is in high demand, so it's essential to make reservations in advance online, in the My Disney Experience app, or by phone. Pre-payment is required to hold your spot, and if you're using a Disney Dining Plan, two table service meals will be deduced from each person dining (not just one like normal Disney table service restaurants).\n\n\n\nThere are three tiers of pricing and seating for Hoop-Dee-Doo. Category one seats on the main floor closest to the stage cost $78 for guests ages 10 and older and $45 for kids ages 3 to 9. Category two seats, toward the back of Pioneer Hall and in the back balcony, cost $74 and $41 respectively, and category three seats, along the sides of the balcony cost $70 and $40.\n\n\n\nThere are no bad seats at Pioneer Hall, as the performers come into the crowd and interact throughout the show and all views of the stage are clear. Kids 2 and under do not require a ticket.\n\nDuring Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue, performers dance and sing on stage and in the crowd. Terri Peters\n\nWhat To Expect\n\nWhen your party gets checked in and seated at Pioneer Hall, your server will begin by taking drink orders. Cornbread and salad are served up family-style, and the show begins shortly after.\n\n\n\nThroughout the show, menu items are brought out family-style, and you'll be able to dine on all-you-care-to-enjoy cowboy beans, fried chicken, cole slaw, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and ribs. When you've had your fill, you'll be served strawberry shortcake for dessert.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the standard Hoop-Dee-Doo menu, there are kids menu items, like chicken tenders, and a plant-based menu that includes items like barbecue jackfruit, plant-based sausage, green beans, and roasted potatoes. In addition to beer, wine, and red and white sangria, Hoop serves drinks like soda, iced tea, lemonade, and coffee.\n\nA full spread of all-you-can-eat treats is served for dinner during Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue. Terri Peters\n\nThe actual dinner show is one of the most fun performances I've seen at Walt Disney World, even though there's not a Disney character in sight. The Pioneer Hall Players put on a rousing two-hour performance complete with jokes, songs, audience interaction, and skits. And watch out, they're known to pull some audience members onto the stage to help with the show!\n\nAt Disney World's Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue, the Pioneer Hall Players entertain while guests dine on all-you-can-eat barbecue. Terri Peters\n\nIs Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue worth it?\n\nFor the amount (and quality) of food you get and the funny, hand-clapping, foot-stomping performance of the Pioneer Hall Players, Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue is something I always suggest to friends from out-of-state who are planning a vacation at Disney. It's a great addition to a Disney vacation, as it gives families a break from the grind of the theme parks and allows for an old-timey dinner show where they can unwind and relax together.\n\n\n\nAfterwards, there's lots more to see and do at Fort Wilderness Resort, from a general store full of souvenirs to horse-drawn carriage rides to a nightly bonfire with Chip and Dale. You can (and should) truly make a night out of visiting Fort Wilderness Resort, especially if you're already visiting for Hoop.\n\nThe strawberry shortcake at Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue is one of the best parts of the experience. Terri Peters\n\nHoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue is one of the greatest dining values at Walt Disney World. I'd go for the strawberry shortcake alone, but the zany antics of the Pioneer Hall Players and the opportunity to get immersed in the campground-style atmosphere of Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort make Hoop a foot-stomping good time you simply have to experience while visiting Disney World.\n\n",

It was originally set to open on May 16th, 2025, but now, Disney announced that opening has been pushed back.\n\nWalt Disney \u2014 A Magical Life is now set to open on July 17th, 2025, about two months after it was originally set to debut. May 16th would have lined up with the start date of Disneyland\u2019s 70th anniversary celebration (which runs through summer 2026), but fans will just have to be a little more patient! July 17th is the official anniversary of Disneyland\u2019s opening day so it all works out.\n\nIt will open alongside new exhibits coming to the Main Street Opera House lobby area. They are working with the Walt Disney Family Museum which is lending over 30 artifacts to display. Disney says some of these are never-before-seen!\n\nThis show is making history as it features the first-ever audio-animatronic of Walt Disney! We got a preview of the animatronic from this concept art when the show was announced in 2024.\n\nAbout the attraction, Disney exec Josh D\u2019Amaro said, \u201cCreating our first Walt figure is an idea that\u2019s been whispered in the hallowed halls of Imagineering for years \u2013 decades, even. We just had to wait for innovation to catch up with our dreams. And we\u2019re finally ready.\u201d\n\nDisney has been working on this show for a little while now, which is why the show surrounding the 16th U.S. President has been closed for refurbishment since April 2024.\n\nThe 70th anniversary celebration at Disneyland is going to be HUGE. A new version of World of Color is planned, the Paint the Night Parade and Wondrous Journeys are returning, the castle is getting a makeover and SO much more.

This new show features an Audio-Animatronic version of Walt Disney telling the story of his life and career from within a recreation of his office at the Disney Studios headquarters in Burbank. The show will run several times a day in the Main Street Opera House right near the park entrance; after \u201cits initial run\u201d the Opera House\u2019s longtime show, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, will return and alternate with A Magical Life.\n\nAlso coming to Disneyland on July 17 is a new tribute to the Sherman Brothers, Robert and Richard, the song-writing team behind some of Disney\u2019s most iconic tunes. \u201cThe Last Verse,\u201d a new short film that will start screening in the Main Street Cinema, will document Richard M. Sherman\u2019s writing of a new, final verse to \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World.\u201d Written to commemorate the ride\u2019s 60th anniversary (it debuted at the New York World\u2019s Fair in 1964 before moving permanently to Disneyland in \u201966), this third and final verse will also be heard in the ride starting on July 17. This new verse marks the final work of Sherman\u2019s career, as he sadly passed on May 25, 2024, at the age of 95.\n\nThe Main Street Opera House will also debut two other exhibits in addition to Walt Disney\u2014A Magical Life. A new gallery will track the creation, growth, and changes of Disneyland over the last seven decades, with a variety of objects from Walt Disney Imagineering and Walt Disney Archives on display. And a second exhibit will explore the history of Audio-Animatronics, from their earliest roots in the monster squid of the classic film 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, to their decades of unflagging service in the Disney parks. Disney has worked together with The Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco to bring a number of rarely seen artifacts to the park for these exhibits.\n\nAnd finally, the Opera House will also offer an exclusive preview of the changes planned for Disneyland in the years to come. This will be found in the exit area after the Magical Life show.\n\nDisneyland has always made a point of celebrating its birthday, and it looks like July 17 will once again be a big day at Walt\u2019s original theme park.",

With the changes, the company said that the accommodation is for those \u201cwho, due to a developmental disability like autism or similar, are unable to wait in a conventional queue for an extended period of time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThe move to curtail eligibility came after Disney said that use of the Disability Access Service tripled in five years, becoming the most widely requested service at its theme parks and far exceeding the population for which it was intended.\n\nHowever, since that time Disney has faced complaints from many people with disabilities who say they have been wrongly denied needed accommodations.\n\nThe lawsuit filed on behalf of Trisha Malone, a San Diego resident who was denied the Disability Access Service, alleges that the new criteria \u201csystematically discriminate\u201d by screening out people with physical disabilities like she has.\n\n\u201cBy explicitly limiting DAS accommodations to guests with developmental disabilities who are \u2018unable to wait in a conventional queue for an extended period of time,\u2019 Disney unlawfully screened out individuals with physical disabilities, such as Plaintiffs Ms. Malone and other physically disabled guests that similarly prevented them from standing or waiting in long lines,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cDisney must provide an equal opportunity for all individuals whose disabilities prevent them from using conventional queues, regardless of whether their disabilities are developmental, physical, or otherwise.\u201d\n\nMalone claims in the suit that she and others with disabilities were asked to disclose private medical information regarding the nature of their disabilities, symptoms and how the conditions impacted their ability to wait in line in public settings where other Disney staff and guests could overhear.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that Disney coerced people with disabilities into waiving their right to participate in any class-action litigation as part of the process of applying for the Disability Access Service.\n\nDisney officials said that the Disability Access Service is one of many accommodations it offers to visitors with disabilities and that the company has assessed that this particular offering is necessary for only a limited percentage of guests.\n\n\u201cDisney is committed to providing a great experience for all who visit our theme parks, and particularly our guests with disabilities who may require special accommodations. Disney offers a broad range of effective disability accommodations and has worked extensively with experts to ensure that our guests\u2019 individual needs are properly matched with the accommodation they require, and we believe the claims in this complaint are without merit,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nJust last month, Disney quietly updated its description of who qualifies for the Disability Access Service, seemingly loosening its criteria. The change was made after Malone\u2019s attorney notified Disney of her claims.\n\nHowever, DAS Defenders, a group that has pushed back against the more stringent rules, said that even people with developmental disabilities like autism have been declined the Disability Access Service since it was overhauled last summer and the group said that they have continued to hear about denials since the recent update took effect.\n\nDisney previously faced years of litigation over a 2013 change to its disability accommodations, but ultimately prevailed.\n\nThe new class-action lawsuit names Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S., Inc. and Inspire Health Alliance, LLC, a health care provider Disney contracted to help assess eligibility for the Disability Access Service. It seeks changes to the Disability Access Service eligibility criteria to include all individuals with disabilities, damages of at least $4,000 per violation and other relief.",

            "content": "Walt Disney Co. is changing some of its internal diversity, equity and inclusion policies, the latest move in the company\u2019s slow pullback from such efforts.\n\nThe Burbank media and entertainment giant will replace the \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d performance factor for executive compensation planning with a \u201ctalent strategies\u201d standard, according to a memo sent Tuesday to executive leaders by Chief Human Resources Officer Sonia Coleman and obtained by The Times.\n\nThe change relates to the formula used to calculate executive pay; the company remains committed to \u201cfostering a company culture where everyone belongs,\u201d the memo said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther corporations outside the entertainment industry have also pulled back on DEI initiatives, which emerged as a hot topic during Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, retailers such as Target, Walmart and Lowe\u2019s have all announced that they will end or cut back on diversity initiatives, many of which were put into place just a few years ago.\n\nDisney\u2019s new \u201ctalent strategies\u201d performance factor will grade how executives uphold company values, incorporate \u201cdifferent perspectives to drive business success,\u201d create an environment where employees can do their best work and \u201csustain a robust pipeline to ensure long-term organizational strength,\u201d according to the document. It will be used in conjunction with other existing performance standards, including \u201csynergy\u201d and \u201cstorytelling and creativity.\u201d\n\nColeman said in the memo that the change was in line with a planned evolution of Disney\u2019s strategic framework to make the company \u201cthe best place to work.\u201d That framework was released in December and is intended to align Disney\u2019s initiatives with its \u201cbusiness goals and company values,\u201d Coleman wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeparately, the company will also shorten the content advisory warnings that appeared on Disney+ before certain older movies such as \u201cDumbo\u201d and \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d which notified audiences that the film \u201cincludes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of peoples or cultures,\u201d according to Axios. The truncated disclaimers will no longer autoplay before the movie and will be moved to the details section, the publication reported.\n\nThe move comes as Disney softens the public stance it took four years ago to champion diversity and inclusion at the company. In the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, Disney pledged millions of dollars to organizations serving underrepresented communities, instituted more gender-inclusive greetings at its theme parks and introduced openly queer characters in its films.\n\nThe company has since been hammered by prominent conservative politicians \u2014 chief among them Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 who branded the company as \u201cwoke\u201d after then-Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek eventually opposed a state law restricting classroom discussions about gender identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the pullback from diversity and inclusion efforts truly began in mid-2023 when Disney\u2019s top diversity head Latondra Newton left her role, which she held for nearly six years. Since then, the company has also dropped a storyline about a trans athlete in its Pixar series, \u201cWin or Lose,\u201d saying \u201cmany parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.\u201d",

            "content": "Shares of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) dropped 1% on Tuesday. The stock has gained 6% over the past three months. The company delivered top and bottom line growth for the first quarter of 2025, with revenue increasing 5% to $24.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share increasing 44% to $1.76 on a year-over-year basis. Disney\u2019s streaming business forms a key part of its overall growth strategy. Here\u2019s a look at the performance of this division in the most recent quarter:\n\nDirect-to-Consumer performance\n\nRevenues in the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business increased 9% YoY to $6 billion in Q1 2025. The segment generated operating income of $293 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $138 million in the year-ago period. The business benefited from growth in subscription revenue, driven by price increases and subscriber growth. DTC advertising revenue was down 2% in Q1, but excluding Disney+ Hotstar, ad revenue grew 16%.\n\nSubscriber numbers\n\nDisney ended Q1 2025 with a total of 124.6 million Disney+ paid subscribers, down 1% sequentially. Disney+ domestic subscribers, which include subscribers in the US and Canada, grew 1% sequentially to 56.8 million while international subscribers dropped 2% to 67.8 million.\n\nTotal Hulu subscribers grew 3% sequentially to 53.6 million. The company ended the quarter with 178 million Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions, reflecting an increase of 0.9 million subscribers compared to Q4 2024.\n\nAverage monthly revenue per paid subscriber for Disney+ increased 5% in Q1 2025. Domestic average revenue was up 4% while international was up 6% in the quarter.\n\nPlans\n\nDisney expects engagement on its streaming platform to grow on the back of strong content and the addition of new features. Movies like Moana and TV shows like Bluey, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and Family Guy remain extremely popular on Disney+. The company\u2019s rollout of several personalization features along with the launch of Streams, which offers scheduled playlists with tailored content, is helping drive engagement.\n\nThe newly launched ESPN tile on Disney+, which provides bundle subscribers access to ESPN+ sports content, is displaying encouraging levels of engagement. The launch of ESPN\u2019s streaming app, which will also be made available on Disney+, is anticipated to further help drive engagement. The company\u2019s bundled offerings are expected to help drive meaningful growth going forward.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, DIS expects a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers on a sequential basis, due to an anticipated temporary rise in churn caused by price increases, as well as the expiration of a wholesale deal in Europe.\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, the company expects operating income for the DTC business to increase approx. $875 million versus the prior year.",

            "content": "If there's one thing we can't get enough of, it's fun facts about Walt Disney World. Luckily for us, The Most Magical Place on Earth is a certifiable treasure trove of interesting factoids, like their time-saving reason for banning over-the-sink mirrors in the bathrooms and why they paint trashcans a particular shade of green.\n\nBut those things are small potatoes compared to this sizable piece of information: Disney World is its own city with its own government. Wild right? But just exactly how much land does Disney own in Florida? We're breaking down all the details below.\n\nHow Big Is Disney World?\n\nToday, Disney World covers 25,000 acres and is around the size of San Francisco. It all started in 1965, when, looking to parlay the success of Disneyland into another year-round theme park, Walt Disney and his business partners purchased 27,000 acres (approximately 40 square miles) of land in Orlando, Florida. They reportedly paid just $5 million for the land.\n\nIs Disney World Its Own City?\n\nAs they got further into the project, they found that owning land spanning two counties (Orange and Osceola) meant dealing with two different local governments. Eventually, they decided that in order to quietly pull off their dream without bureaucratic red tape, they'd need to create Disney's own self-regulating municipality within a special district.\n\nWith some savvy legal work, Reedy Creek Improvement District was established in 1967 by the Florida Legislature. To this day, Reedy Creek Improvement District includes the cities of Bay Lake (where the Disney theme parks are located) and Lake Buena Vista (previously known as Reedy Creek, where you'll find Downtown Disney and the park hotels).\n\nReedy Creek has the power to levy taxes, write building codes, and develop and maintain its own infrastructure, just like a typical city or county in Florida. The whole thing is run by a government board that technically functions as a democracy\u2014with elections and everything.\n\nAnd that's not all. According to another article in the Sentinel, as of 2015, the district housed 44 residents between two gated mobile-home parks. The residents of Reedy Creek\u2014all Disney World employees and their children\u2014are handpicked by the company. Each owns their mobile home and pays Disney $75 a month to rent the lot space. In exchange, the residents provide the votes needed on issues such as approval of bonds for park improvements.\n\n\"It's really just a nice situation all around,\" Morgan Palfreyman, a Disney facility asset management employee who lives in Bay Lake with his wife and their seven children told the Sentinel. \"I have no intent of moving at any time.\"\n\nAnd we can't say we blame him!",

            "content": "Disney theme parks have set the standard worldwide for amusement park creativity and quality. Another way Disney sets the standard? Its pricing. Disney tickets are not cheap.\n\nNowadays, a single day ticket to Disneyland or Walt Disney World tops well over a hundred dollars per person. That\u2019s without any fancy add-ons like Park Hopper or Disney Genie+.\n\nAlthough you likely won\u2019t find free Disney tickets (unless you're super lucky), you can do better than simply buying tickets off the official Disney website. Take a look at some of the best ways to buy Disney tickets:\n\n1. Use discounted ticket sites\n\nThere's no shortage of discounted Disney ticket websites willing to sell you tickets. Just make sure you shop with one that's reputable. Here are a couple that NerdWallet recommends:\n\nBuy discount Disney tickets through AAA\n\nAAA, the famous association that offers benefits on everything from hotel stays to restaurants, also sells discounted Disney tickets to members in certain locations.\n\nAAA membership isn\u2019t free, but it can be worth signing up for AAA for the other AAA discounts. Discounts vary by region, so confirm your region does in fact offer discount Disney tickets before signing up.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Active-duty service members and eligible veterans qualify for special rates on Disney tickets that can shave hundreds of dollars off the regular purchase price.\n\nBuy discount Disney tickets through Undercover Tourist\n\nUndercover Tourist is another popular, reputable website offering a cheaper way to buy Disney tickets.\n\nSometimes its discounts can be even more than those AAA offerings. And the real benefit? They\u2019re available to everyone without a membership.\n\nUndercover Tourist also offers deals that cover other theme parks, including Universal Studios discount tickets.\n\n2. Take advantage of Disney's limited-time ticket deals\n\nIf you can be flexible with the day you go to Disney, you can save big. Disney tickets always follow a dynamic pricing model, where tickets on more in-demand days are more expensive than those in the off-season. Generally speaking, you'll pay far more to go to Disneyland on Christmas Day than a random Tuesday in early December.\n\nAnd what's more, Disney sometimes runs its own ticket promotions \u2014 which almost always occur during off-season or shoulder season. Here are the best Disney ticket deals that come straight from Disney:\n\nDisneyland ticket deals\n\nIf you're going to Disneyland with kids...\n\nDisneyland Resort in California is running a limited-time offer for kids. For visits between Jan. 7 and March 20, 2025, kids between ages 3 through 9 can nab one-day, one-park tickets for as low as $50 per child.\n\nIf you're going to Disneyland for multiple days this summer...\n\nIn honor of Disneyland's 70th anniversary, Disney is offering a 3-day, 1-park per day ticket for $120 per day or a 4-day, 1-park per day ticket for $100 per day, valid for visits May 16 through August 14, 2025. You can add Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi Pass for an additional fee. These discounted anniversary tickets go on sale March 11.\n\nIf you're a Southern California resident...\n\nIf you live near Disneyland, you might also qualify to buy discounted theme park tickets for visits before the busy summer season starts again. Right now, Disneyland is offering three-day tickets for customers with eligible Southern California zip codes:\n\nThree-day, one-park-per-day ticket for $199 ($66/day).\n\nThree-day Park Hopper ticket for $289 ($96/day).\n\nThree-day, one-park-per-day ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass for $295 ($98/day).\n\nThree-day, Park Hopper ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass $385 ($128/day).\n\nThat's not bad considering a one-day, one-park Disneyland ticket costs as much as $206 for certain high-demand days. These special tickets for Southern California residents are valid for visits Jan. 1, 2025, through May 15, 2025. The three-day ticket can be used on consecutive days or spread out on separate dates.\n\nIf you'll visit multiple times per year...\n\nConsider purchasing an annual pass (called a Magic Key). These annual passes start at $599, and can be cheaper than buying Park Hopper theme park admission on multiple days throughout the year. It also offers discounts on select parking, dining and merchandise. Be sure to check the blackout dates before you buy. Disneyland Magic Keys go on sale Jan. 22.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Pay with points\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to use points when purchasing your tickets, you\u2019re in a bit of a bind. Currently there is no, say, AmEx discount for Disney tickets. It\u2019s still possible to use your reward points to buy tickets, though it\u2019s not necessarily a great value.\n\nWebsites such as Undercover Tourist allow you to pay with PayPal at checkout. Many card issuers, including Citi, American Express and Chase, have partnered with PayPal in order to redeem your points. The value you\u2019ll receive isn\u2019t great; AmEx points used this way are worth 0.7 cent each, while Chase points can be redeemed at a rate of 0.8 cent per point. Meanwhile, those who hold the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card will receive a value of 1 cent per point.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nIf you hold a credit card with a purchase erasing feature, you can also redeem points for statement credits at a rate of 1 cent each. These include the Bank of America\u00ae Premium Rewards\u00ae credit card, among others.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to purchase theme park tickets with points\n\n4. Buy a vacation package\n\nThis next option won\u2019t have you using points, but it can still save money. Vacation packages bundle options such as theme park tickets, hotels, car rentals and airfare, typically for less than buying a la carte.\n\nCostco Travel requires a membership card (which is its own annual fee), but it offers some of the best Disney vacation packages.\n\nFor example, we found one five-day vacation at a Hilton, including five-day park hopper tickets, for $2,008.56.\n\nWe priced out the cost to book that exact same hotel and tickets separately. It came out to $2,811.53 \u2014 and that didn't include the parking.\n\nIn this case, you\u2019d save more than $800 by bundling your hotel and tickets together into a vacation package. Hilton Honors Disney ticket packages are also available, as are many different retailers offering vacation packages.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Save money on your vacation by using points to book your hotel.\n\nMany vacation packages also code as travel on your card. Maximize points earning by paying with a credit card that earns additional bonus points on travel.\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to go to Disney World for cheap\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Use the United MileagePlus X app\n\nThe United MileagePlus X app awards you bonus miles for purchases with hundreds of different retailers, including Disney.\n\nDisney gift cards available through the app will reward you with 3 United miles per dollar spent. You can buy in increments up to $500 and then immediately use those gift cards to buy tickets on the Disney website. Even better, you\u2019ll still earn reward points on the credit card you use to pay, which means you\u2019ll be double-dipping on your earnings.\n\nSure, this isn't a discount upfront, but it makes for an easy way to earn United miles, and potentially rack up additional miles (particular if you spend on a United credit card).\n\nAnd of course, you don't have to limit yourself to just buying Disney tickets. You can also use this trick to buy Disney gift cards that will cover food, souvenirs and other expenses on property.\n\nJust understand that gift cards cannot be exchanged back for cash, so only purchase enough gift cards for what you'll actually spend. And keep in mind that certain retailers on Disney property might not accept Disney gift cards (e.g. third-party retailers on site, or certain vendors that operate in unconventional locations such as balloon vendors).\n\n\u00bb Learn more: How to find cheap flights to Disney World\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Buy Target gift cards\n\nHere's a similar trick to the United trick above: use the Target Circle\u2122 Credit Card to buy Disney gift cards. You can buy Disney gift cards at Target using your Target RedCard to get 5% off the purchase price. Yep, the card offers 5% off most Target purchases both in-store and online, and that extends to Disney gift cards.\n\nThis strategy effectively reduces the cost of your Disney tickets (and again, anything else you buy at Disney using those gift cards, like food or souvenirs) by 5%.\n\n7. Get free water park tickets when you book select Walt Disney World hotels\n\nWe said that free Disney tickets were near-impossible to come by, but here's one exception: you can get free Walt Disney World water park tickets (with limitations, of course). Here's the scoop:\n\nGuests who book a qualifying stay at a Disney Resorts Collection hotel for stays with a check-in date anytime in 2025 receive complimentary tickets to either of the two Disney water parks\u2014Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon.\n\nSince Disney water park tickets cost about $80 per person, families or groups who would have purchased water park admission anyway might find this an incredible deal, particularly if they can book at one of the cheapest eligible Disney World hotels.\n\nJust note that this benefit only works on your check-in day, so don't anticipate spending time in the traditional theme parks on that day. Additionally, check-in to your hotel early to maximize the deal's value.\n\n8. Leverage demographics and affiliations\n\nDisney often offers special offers for locals, as well as for people with affiliations such as U.S. military personnel.\n\nFor example, Disney is offering a discount on its 2025 Disney Military Salute Tickets, which are available to active or retired members of the U.S. Military and their spouses, and can be used by themselves, family members and friends.\n\nDisney considers eligible service members as those in the the National Guard, Reservists, the US Coast Guard, the US Space Force, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service (PHS), and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nTricks for finding cheap Disney tickets\n\nThere\u2019s no bones about it: Disney tickets can be expensive. You could consider some cheaper Disney alternatives, but there are also plenty of ways to save on the cost of your vacation.\n\nYou might also consider an annual pass, (which Disneyland refers to as a Magic Key and which Walt Disney World simply refers to as an annual pass), if you visit often.",

The previous version noted that the film \u201cincludes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of peoples or cultures,\u201d while the new version reads: \u201cThis program is presented as originally created and may contain stereotypes or negative depictions.\u201d\n\nIn November 2019, Disney first added content warnings to movies such as \u201cDumbo\u201d due to racist depictions found in the films created by Disney in the 1940s and \u201950s. \u201cThis program is presented as originally created,\u201d the warning previously said. \u201cIt may contain outdated cultural depictions.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDisney changed the wording in October 2020 to the longer content warning: \u201cThis program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together. Disney is committed to creating stories with inspirational and aspirational themes that reflect the rich diversity of the human experience around the globe.\u201d\n\nNow it has reverted the content warning back to a version of the one inserted in 2019.\n\nDisney\u2019s chief human resources officer Sonia Coleman outlined changes to the company\u2019s DEI efforts in a memo to leadership Tuesday.\n\n\u201cCreating a welcoming and respectful environment for our employees and guests is core to our company culture and our business,\u201d Coleman wrote. \u201cOur values \u2014 integrity, creativity, collaboration, community, inclusion \u2014 guide our actions and how we treat each other. Today I want to provide an update on how our values are embedded in our leader compensation programs, specifically our Other Performance Factors (OPFs), as well as share some of the work that has been underway to evolve our talent strategy consistent with these values.\u201d\n\nRead the full note, which was obtained by Variety, below.\n\nExecutive Leaders,\n\nFor over 100 years, Disney has entertained and inspired generations of families from all walks of life around the world. We create entertainment that appeals to a global audience, and having a workforce that reflects the consumers we serve helps drive our business. With more than 230,000 dedicated employees and Cast Members in more than 40 countries across six continents, Disney has long believed that the rich variety of talents and experiences our employees bring to their work is good for our business and enhances the experience of our global consumers, audiences, and guests.\n\nCreating a welcoming and respectful environment for our employees and guests is core to our company culture and our business. Our values \u2014 integrity, creativity, collaboration, community, inclusion \u2014 guide our actions and how we treat each other. Today I want to provide an update on how our values are embedded in our leader compensation programs, specifically our Other Performance Factors (OPFs), as well as share some of the work that has been underway to evolve our talent strategy consistent with these values.\n\nOther Performance Factors (OPFs): Beginning this fiscal year, we are adding a new \u201cTalent Strategy\u201d factor to our executive compensation planning. This factor will assess how leaders uphold our company values, incorporate different perspectives to drive business success, cultivate an environment where all employees can thrive, and sustain a robust pipeline to ensure long-term organizational strength. This new factor represents an evolution of important concepts in the former Diversity & Inclusion OPF and will be used alongside our other two OPFs, \u201cStorytelling & Creativity\u201d and \u201cSynergy.\u201d\n\nAs many of you know, we have spent the last year partnering with stakeholders across the company to discuss the evolution of our strategic framework for advancing our commitment to being welcoming, respectful, and inclusive in how we operate so we are the best place to work. The resulting framework \u2014 which we released in December \u2014 is designed to align our initiatives with our business goals and company values, centered around four key pillars:\n\nPeople: We reach and attract the best, most talented people around the world and foster barrier-free talent processes for everyone.\n\nCulture: We purposefully champion a culture where everyone belongs and can contribute to our business success.\n\nMarket Reach: We create unforgettable stories, experiences, and products that entertain and resonate globally.\n\nCommunity: We learn from and support under-served communities by establishing and investing in impactful relationships with organizations and business stakeholders.\n\nAs we developed this new framework, we looked at ways to enhance our programs and practices to strengthen our workplace environment, in service of our business. While some of you are already familiar with what\u2019s new, we wanted to highlight some of the key developments:\n\nNew Online Destination: In December, we added our new framework to our corporate Impact website and the Belong hub on MyDisneyToday, with a focus on our above pillars and continued progress. This new framework, rooted in our efforts to enhance our employee experience, marks the evolution of the significant work done with Reimagine Tomorrow and succeeds that branding.\n\nEmployee Groups: Last year, we began the process of unifying and streamlining our global enterprise-wide Belonging Employee Resource Groups (BERGs) structure, and rebranded the \u201cB\u201d in BERG from \u201cBusiness\u201d to \u201cBelonging\u201d to highlight that our employee groups\u2019 role is focused on strengthening our employee community and workplace experience.\n\nWhile this will continue to evolve, what won\u2019t change is our commitment to fostering a company culture where everyone belongs and everyone can excel, enabling us to deliver the globally appealing entertainment that drives our business.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nSonia",

            "content": "Why Jalen Hurts says he won't change phone screen after Eagles Super Bowl LIX win\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (WPVI) -- Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts celebrated the big Super Bowl win with an inaugural trip to the most magical place on Earth at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.\n\nHurts was the center of a colorful parade down Main Street U.S.A. at Magic Kingdom.\n\nHe opened up about the win with \"Good Morning America,\" saying he has \"a ton of gratitude\" after the reality of the situation finally sank in.\n\n\"I'm truly blessed,\" Hurts said in an interview with Will Reeve and \"GMA.\" \"To be able to share this moment with Disney World being my first time here -- it's been amazing.\"\n\nAfter a decisive 40-22 win over the Kansas City Chiefs at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday night, denying them a coveted three-peat Super Bowl win, Hurts -- who threw for 221 yards and two touchdowns and ran in a third touchdown on a tush push play -- was named Super Bowl LIX MVP.\n\n\"Honestly, going into the locker room and seeing my teammates celebrating, that's when it hit. That's when it hit,\" Hurts said.\n\nThe Eagles win on Sunday marked redemption for Philadelphia after the birds previously lost to Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs by just three points in Super Bowl LVII two years ago.\n\nHurts used an image of himself walking off the field in defeat amid red and yellow Chiefs confetti as motivation on his phone's lock screen, and despite the turn of events, he said, \"I probably won't\" change it because \"the motivation doesn't change, you hate losing more than you love winning.\"\n\nBefore Hurts left for Disney, he was asked about his winning mentality.\n\n\"My entire career, I've been challenged by different things, it's put me in a place where I'm trying to improve, improve, improve,\" Hurts said.\n\nHurts also said he got to where he is today with great leadership and being surrounded by those who set good examples.\n\nNow, after hoisting the coveted Lombardi Trophy, Hurts has finally had his taste of true victory.\n\n\"I think the 364 days that a year you work day in and day out, blood, sweat and tears just for one moment. And that's to hold the trophy,\" he said. \"When I saw myself in I reflection, it was something like I never seen before. So that's an amazing feeling.\"\n\nWhen asked if the victory felt even better than he imagined, Hurts admitted he wasn't sure what to expect.\n\n\"I didn't know. I didn't know how I be,\" he said. \"I didn't even know how to put it into words.\"\n\nHurts' \"good adrenaline rush\" continued from riding Tron and spending the day with his fianc\u00e9e and loved ones while soaking up the Disney magic and alongside elated Eagles fans.\n\nThe celebration at Walt Disney World Resort included more attractions, entertainment, and a grand parade down Main Street, USA at Magic Kingdom.\n\nThis marks the second time in recent years that an Eagles player has been featured in Disney's legendary Super Bowl campaign, which began in 1987 when Phil Simms first proclaimed those iconic words: \"I'm going to Disney World!\"\n\nGMA contributed to this article.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is the parent company of this station",

            "content": "On Nov. 22, 2013, I met Marty Sklar \u2013 Disney Legend and former head of Walt Disney Imagineering \u2013 in front of Town Hall in Disneyland.\n\nIt was unusually cool that day and a light rain was falling as we made our way up Main Street, U.S.A. toward Club 33 in the New Orleans Square section of the park.\n\nWith my wife Janet and our friend Mike Splitstone following behind, I chatted with Marty on a wide range of Disney-related topics as we walked along the fabled thoroughfare.\n\nAbout halfway up Main Street, I asked Marty for his thoughts on the passing of Diane Disney Miller, Walt and Lillian Disney\u2019s daughter, who died a few days before on Nov. 19.\n\n\u201cHer health had deteriorated since she fell back in September,\u201d Marty said with a tinge of sadness in his voice.\n\nIn the years prior to her death, he added, \u201cShe had devoted so much time and energy to telling her father\u2019s story and preserving his memory at the Walt Disney Family Museum.\u201d\n\nMarty went on to say how much he loved his trips to the museum and suggested \u2013 in not-so-subtle terms \u2013 that my wife and I should make plans to visit what he called \u201ca real gem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to me to preserve Walt\u2019s legacy,\u201d Marty added. \u201cDiane was always intent on doing just that. I\u2019ve always appreciated what she tried to do \u2026 to focus on Walt the man, and what he accomplished. That was always her goal.\u201d\n\nIt took more than a decade (one scheduled trip was canceled because of wildfires in northern California and another was called off thanks to COVID-19), but we finally found our way to the Walt Disney Family Museum in January.\n\nOur time at the museum was, to paraphrase Marty Sklar, a real gem of an experience. What we discovered was a loving tribute and a true testament to Walt Disney\u2019s life and career, just as Diane Disney Miller had intended.\n\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum is located in the beautiful Presido section of San Francisco, with the Golden Gate Bridge as a stunning backdrop.\n\nThe Presidio occupies the northern section of the San Francisco Peninsula and is a former U.S. Army base. Its sprawling grounds are part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and feature stunning views of the San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum opened in 2009 and was the culmination of a years-long effort by Diane Disney Miller and her son, Walter E.D. Miller, to honor a man who meant so much to so many people around the world. The museum is owned and operated by the Walt Disney Family Foundation, a non-profit foundation.\n\nAccording to exhibition co-curator and animation historian Don Peri, \u201cDiane Disney Miller was a warm, generous, and compassionate person who had a vision for The Walt Disney Family Museum that she followed tenaciously as she and her son Walter led this family enterprise.\n\n\u201cShe initially considered locations for the museum in southern California, but fortunately for us in northern California, they located it here in the Presidio of San Francisco.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve visited Walt Disney Presents, the walkthrough attraction at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios, and I\u2019ve experienced the traveling Disney 100: The Exhibition. Both are well done and quite enjoyable.\n\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum, however, takes a more thorough, more extensive, and deeply personal look into Walt\u2019s life, his family, and his career, and delves into the fascinating story of how his \u201camusement enterprise\u201d was born, grew, struggled \u2026 but ultimately flourished.\n\nIt\u2019s also much more detailed than the previously mentioned exhibits. For example, whereas Disney 100 had a scale model of the ground-breaking multiplane camera, the Walt Disney Family Museum features one of three surviving devices.\n\nThe museum also features a Universal camera, propped up on a wooden tripod, that Walt used during the early days of his movie career, as well as an innovative Circle-Vision 360 camera and the special water-tight device used to film underwater scenes for the Disney classic 200,000 Leagues Under the Sea movie.\n\nYour journey begins in the museum\u2019s lobby \u2013 one of 10 themed lobbies \u2013 where the 248 awards and citations Walt received during his career are prominently displayed.\n\nAmong them are the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the key to the city of San Francisco, and numerous Academy Awards \u2026 including the now-famous honorary Oscar Walt received for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (one regular-sized statue alongside seven smaller ones).\n\nOnce inside the expansive 40,000-square-foot complex, you\u2019re immersed in the Disney family history, which is traced back to Ireland. There are never-before-seen photos and artifacts related to the Disney family, dating back to the 1800s.\n\nThere are photos and exhibits delving into Walt and his brother Roy O. Disney\u2019s early years in the Midwest \u2026 as well as their trials and tribulations getting their fledgling animation studio off the ground.\n\nThere\u2019s even Walt and Lillian Disney\u2019s marriage certificate on display.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get past the first section of the museum, it\u2019s so enticing,\u201d Marty Sklar said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of early Disney memorabilia, things that Walt had recorded. All of us who knew and worked with Walt can really appreciate those things. They didn\u2019t whitewash anything. It\u2019s the whole story of Walt in a direct and interesting way.\u201d\n\nThe deeper you go into the museum, the more sophisticated the presentations become. The museum features interactive galleries, animated shorts, movie clips, music, and listening stations to enhance the overall experience.\n\nThe story of the innovative Alice Comedies short films from the 1920s, which combined live action and animation, is explored, as are the challenges Walt and Roy faced in mastering synchronized sound and the use of color in their short films.\n\nThe story of the making of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs receives special attention (as it should, given the fact that it was the first-ever full-length feature animated film and represented a true turning point in the motion picture industry \u2013 which explains the special Oscar).\n\nAnd, in keeping with Diane Disney Miller\u2019s vision to present a truthful depiction of her father\u2019s life, we see a display delving into the infamous Disney Studios animators\u2019 strike in 1941.\n\nThe animators\u2019 strike dragged on for months, adding to Walt\u2019s personal crises at the time: His mother Flora died in 1938, and his father Elias passed away in 1941. Walt called that period of time \u201cthe toughest in my whole life.\u201d\n\nAlso during the early 1940s, Walt and a small band of colleagues (known as El Grupo) toured South America as part of a U.S. government-sanctioned goodwill trip to shore up relationships with our southern neighbors.\n\nThe latter stages of the museum tour are perhaps the most fascinating.\n\nYou leave one section of the museum and walk through a glass-enclosed breezeway, which offers a stunning view of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nAt the end of the breezeway is the actual park bench Walt sat on while his daughters enjoyed the park\u2019s rides \u2026 inspiring him to build a new kind of theme park \u201cwhere parents and their children could have fun together.\u201d\n\nUpon entering the next gallery, you\u2019re greeted by the actual Carolwood Pacific Railroad \u2026 Walt\u2019s miniature, rideable train which ran through his property in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles.\n\nWalt would take daughters Diane and Sharon, his daughters\u2019 friends and even members of his staff on coveted rides along the winding Carolwood Pacific route.\n\nThe display is located to the left as you enter, at eye level, so you can take a good look at all the details Walt personally put into his beloved railway, including the red cushions that his guests sat on.\n\nAbove the train is a scale model of Walt\u2019s property, showing the track layout surrounding his house.\n\nAs you walk down a winding ramp, a 12-foot diameter scale model of Disneyland catches your eye. You could spend hours looking at the intricate details that were put into the model, which depicts The Happiest Place on Earth in the 1960s.\n\nI even spotted a model of the unique Monsanto House of the Future, which was on display in Tomorrowland from 1957 to 1967.\n\nThe final gallery display focuses on the latter stages of Walt\u2019s life and career, from Disney\u2019s participation in the 1960 Winter Olympic Games in Squaw Valley, California, to the company\u2019s pivotal involvement in the 1964-1965 New York World\u2019s Fair, to the failed attempt to build the Mineral King ski resort, to the creation of Walt Disney World, to Walt\u2019s final days.\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s an entire wall devoted to all the moving tributes that appeared around the world in newspapers, magazines and on television following Walt\u2019s death on Dec. 15, 1966.\n\nI was bitten by the Disney bug at the tender age of 5 in 1955. Throughout the decades, I have expressed my appreciation of all things Disney through newspaper features, on-line blogs and in my seven (soon to be eight) books.\n\nAlong the way, I was fortunate to be a Disney cast member for more than a decade, all while cultivating special friendships with numerous Disney Legends and Legends-in-waiting.\n\nOur visit to the Walt Disney Family Museum served to further solidify my already strong affection for Disney\u2019s wonderful world. As Marty Sklar said, the museum is a real gem.\n\nFor information on the Walt Disney Family Museum, visit https://www.waltdisney.org/.\n\n***********\n\nSpecial thanks to our friends Dorene and Mike Splitstone, who drove us from Disneyland through the scary Hughes wildfire near Santa Clarita on Jan. 22, to a wonderful and quaint Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara, and then up the California coast to San Francisco. The Walt Disney Family Museum (and the city of San Francisco, for that matter) wouldn\u2019t have been as enjoyable without their special brand of kindness.\n\nChuck Schmidt is an award-winning journalist and retired Disney cast member who has covered all things Disney since 1984 in both print and on-line. He has authored or co-authored seven books on Disney, including his On the Disney Beat, The Beat Goes On and Disney\u2019s Dream Weavers for Theme Park Press. He has written a regular blog for AllEars.Net, called Still Goofy About Disney, since 2015.\n\nComments (1)",

            "content": "Walt Disney (DIS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned +2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has lost 16.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Disney is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.5%. This estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.11 indicates a change of +12.3% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Disney.",

The program was mentioned in the 2023 report, which defines the program as \"the Company\u2019s digital destination for amplifying underrepresented voices and features some of Disney\u2019s DE&I commitments and actions.\" The program hosted a controversial 2022 leaked \"all-hands\" meeting in which a Disney executive touting her \"not at all secret gay agenda.\"\n\n\"On my little pocket of Proud Family Disney TVA, the showrunners were super welcoming\u2026 our leadership over there has been super welcoming to my not-at-all-secret gay agenda\u2026 they\u2019re going hard\u2026 I don\u2019t have to be afraid to have these two characters kiss in the background. I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness,\" executive producer Latoya Raveneau said at the time.\n\nDISNEY EXPOSED: LEAKED VIDEOS SHOW OFFICIALS PUSHING LGBT AGENDA, SAYING DESANTIS WANTS TO 'ERASE' GAY KIDS\n\nDisney\u2019s \"Reimagine Tomorrow\" webpage, which is still active, says its mission is \"amplifying underrepresented voices and untold stories as well as championing the importance of accurate representation in media and entertainment.\"\n\nThe page also lists racial and gender breakdowns of their content and workforce as of 2021 and boasts of their Business Employee Research Groups which represent employees from different ethnic backgrounds.\n\n\"The Walt Disney Company Has Established Business Employee Resource Groups Across 10 Dimensions: Asian/ Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander, Black/ African American Disabilities Hispanic/ Latin X Jewish, LGBTQ+, Multicultural, Native American/ Indigenous Veterans/ Military, Women,\" the website boasts.\n\n\"Disney dropping [Reimagine Tomorrow] from their DEI section could mean they're walking back their DEI investments, or it could signal they're hiding them,\" Stefan Padfield, director of the Free Enterprise Project for the National Center for Public Policy Research, told Fox News Digital. \"Either they recognize that more litigation is coming, or it could be part of a vibe shift.\"\n\nTarget was recently hit with a lawsuit related to its DEI initiatives as shareholders contend the retailer failed to be transparent about the risks posed by their DEI policies and Pride displays.\n\n\"Where is your data that shows DEI serves the bottom line?\" Padfield asked of companies that still employ DEI measures.\n\n\"The concern about the scrutiny about these questions is built into this movement we\u2019re seeing across companies. The Trump administration announced they'll investigate nine companies for their DEI practices, and you're seeing corporations scramble to not be among those nine,\" he said.\n\nBy scaling back its DEI section in its SEC filing, Disney joins a growing trend of companies from Meta to John Deere that have rolled back or eliminated their DEI initiatives.\n\nThe movie, cruise and theme park behemoth has also dropped its \"The Disney Look\" appearance guidelines from their DEI section in their 2024 SEC filing. The 2023 SEC filing states that the guidelines were \"updated to cultivate a more inclusive environment that encourages and celebrates authentic expressions of belonging among employees.\"\n\nDisney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDISNEY ACCUSED OF MISLEADING SHAREHOLDERS WITH \u2018WOKE POLITICAL AGENDA\u2019\n\nThe moves come as Disney reportedly lost 700,000 users on its Disney+ streaming platform in the final quarter of 2024. The entertainment conglomerate has faced backlash for, what some call, its \"woke political agenda.\" The corporation was sued by America First Legal in March 2024 for allegedly doing \"damage to Disney\u2019s brand, properties, and commercial reputation by management\u2019s manufactured misalignment between its woke political and social agenda and the vast majority of the Company\u2019s customers.\"\n\nDisney\u2019s move to distance itself from the woke initiative comes as activist investors are pressuring the company to drop its participation in the Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) Corporate Equality Index.\n\nThe HRC releases a yearly survey which grades corporations on their compliance with a litany of LGBTQ initiatives, among them \"Equal health coverage for transgender individuals without exclusion for medically necessary care\" and \"Integration of gender identity and sexual orientation in professional development, skills-based or other leadership training that includes elements of diversity and/or cultural competency.\" Disney has had a perfect score on the Equality Index every year since 2007.\n\n'CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD' STAR SAYS THE CHARACTER SHOULD NOT REPRESENT AMERICA\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nPadfield is attempting to get Disney to drop its participation in the survey. Padfield contends that HRC increases its requirements to achieve a perfect score on each successive evaluation, new indexes are released annually, and meeting these requirements could force companies to pursue policies that are bad for business.\n\n\"There\u2019s a number of items in the index that in order to get the perfect score really start pushing corporations out on a radical edge,\" Padfield told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s essentially built to work like ratchet\u2026 a lot of people\u2019s perceptions is that these companies are just moved further and further left in terms of this radicalism.\"",

            "content": "Last quarter's numbers reflect a business and structure that will look considerably different a year from now.\n\nGiven the market's bearish response to its fiscal first-quarter results, it would be easy to presume the worst of The Walt Disney Company (DIS 1.83%). To be fair, there are a few red flags buried in its Q1 numbers.\n\nHowever, there's more good news than not. Besides, most of these red flags' underlying concerns are being addressed. Investors should be seeing the proverbial glass as half-full rather than half-empty, particularly in light of the stock's subpar performance since its 2021 peak.\n\nTranslation: Disney stock is a buy here.\n\nDon't misread the message. Even the bulls have good reason to be asking tough questions here. Chief among them is what the media giant intends to do about its struggling cable and network television business.\n\nBy and large, though, most of the obvious questions have good answers.\n\nMixed bag\n\nFor the three-month stretch ending in December, Walt Disney turned $24.7 billion worth of revenue into a per-share profit of $1.76. Both were better than the year-ago comparisons of $23.5 billion and $1.22 per share. Both also rolled in above expectations of $24.67 billion and $1.45 per share.\n\nThe company did particularly well on the film front thanks to Moana 2, although its theme parks and hotels were a bright spot too. The real shining star of the quarter, however, is Disney's direct-to-consumer (or DTC) streaming business, led by Disney+. Higher subscription prices pumped its top line up by 9% to nearly $6.1 billion, keeping this operation in the black.\n\nNot every Disney segment is on a tear, though. For instance, the linear (cable) television arm of its entertainment division suffered a 7% setback in sales. It's still facing a cord-cutting movement driven by the advent of streaming services, including those offered by Disney.\n\nIts sports business -- mostly ESPN -- is also currently less than impressive. While 8% year-over-year revenue growth paired with 15% growth is solid, this venture hasn't shown any meaningful, sustained net growth since early 2022.\n\nPerhaps the data nugget most troubling to investors, however, was the slight loss in its total number of streaming subscribers. Although Disney+ picked up a few more domestic customers, growth continues to slow here, while the service outright lost customers overseas. ESPN+ shed a few subscribers as well.\n\nThe bears, of course, readily made a mountain out of that molehill.\n\nHere's the thing: Most (although not all) of these concerns are either being addressed, or will soon no longer matter.\n\nMeet the new and improved Walt Disney\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is mostly operating in a holding pattern until it takes care of one huge matter of business. That's the impending merger of all of Hulu with streaming-cable-television outfit FuboTV. Although Disney will be a 70% owner of this publicly traded company, it will be operated independently from Walt Disney itself, allowing the company to focus on more promising prospects like Disney+. It will also likely mean that Disney will stop reporting Hulu's stagnating fiscal and subscriber metrics.\n\nThis strategic merger/divesting also paves the way for a stand-alone, sports-focused streaming service from Disney.\n\nThe planned sports-centric joint venture between Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery called Venu was unsurprisingly canceled just a few days after The Walt Disney Company announced its intentions for FuboTV in January. Fox supplies FuboTV with cable programming, potentially pitting it indirectly against its own partner, while Warner and FuboTV were contentiously unable to come to a carriage agreement in April of last year. However, that decision doesn't necessarily prevent Disney from forging similar partnerships in the future. In the meantime, the launch of a stand-alone streaming version of ESPN is still slated to debut toward the end of this year.\n\nThis isn't just a renamed ESPN+, which famously doesn't include the programming offered via the cable channel. This is the streaming version of the live cable channel, plus plenty more exclusive on-demand content.\n\nIt matters simply because live sports is still the single biggest reason people are willing to pay sky-high cable bills, according to a recent survey from CableTV.com.\n\nBut won't this hurt the cable television business, including Walt Disney's linear TV arm (consisting of The Disney Channel and the ABC network)? It certainly won't help. However, there may be little help on the horizon for cable anyway. Given that linear television only accounts for about one-tenth of Disney's revenue and roughly 20% of the company's operating income, focusing fewer resources on its TV business to put more on its most promising growth prospects -- like theme parks, films, and streaming -- is arguably the more fruitful long-term move.\n\nBuckle up\n\nIt's admittedly a lot to take in. And, given Disney's lackluster and somewhat inconsistent performance since 2020, many investors are understandably not interested in digging into the company's current evolution.\n\nThe thing is, these are the growth-minded moves the market's been waiting on for a while. The Walt Disney Company's foreseeable future is more promising now than it's been since before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, even if most people don't seem to see it yet.\n\nJust bear in mind that this ticker's still got plenty of potential volatility left to dish out. It could take months for investors to start seeing -- and then believing in -- the improvement being made here. While it's worth the wait, it could be an occasionally uncomfortable one.",

The average cost for a family of four to Disney World can easily top $6,000 for a seven-night trip, and that\u2019s if you\u2019re a frugal traveler.\n\nBut a weeklong family trip to Disney World exceeding $15,000 is not unheard of, especially for families splurging on memorable character meals and hotels closer to the theme park.\n\nA recent NerdWallet analysis sought to understand the average cost for a family of four to go to Disney World, accounting for line items across these four categories:\n\nPark tickets (and add-ons, like Lightning Lane Multi Pass and Single Pass).\n\nOn-property hotel room rates.\n\nFood at park restaurants.\n\nAdd-on activities, like spa treatments and tours.\n\nBecause Disney offers options for all sorts of budgets, NerdWallet categorized trips into three price tiers: Value, Moderate and Deluxe (the same classifications that Disney World uses for its hotels). Frugal families might fit everyone into a single room and dine only at counter service restaurants or food carts. Meanwhile, families willing to spend more might purchase line-skipping privileges, larger rooms and fancier meals. Those variations are accounted for in NerdWallet\u2019s price breakdowns. (Read our methodology at the end of this piece.)\n\nAverage Disney World vacation cost per person, per day\n\nHere\u2019s what you can expect to spend per person, per day for a theme park ticket, hotel room and meal, based on travel style:\n\nValue Moderate Deluxe 1-day, 1-park theme park ticket $160. $175. $175. 1-night hotel room (Saturday night) $286. $366. $877. Individual meal $19. $59. $93.\n\nAverage Disney World vacation cost for a family of 4\n\nHere\u2019s the average Disney World vacation cost for a family of four, broken down by travel style and length of trip. These prices include the cost of three meals per day on Disney property, daily theme park tickets and overnight stays at a Disney-owned hotel.\n\n1 night 3 nights 7 nights Value $1,227. $2,783. $6,463. Moderate $1,525. $3,636. $8,912. Deluxe $2,332. $6,075. $15,559.\n\nDisney World ticket prices\n\nCinderella Castle at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. (Photo courtesy of Disney)\n\nDisney World ticket prices vary by park and date, but one-day Magic Kingdom tickets average $160 apiece. (Magic Kingdom is typically viewed as the most family-friendly of the theme parks, but it\u2019s also typically the most expensive park.)\n\nPer-day prices drop the longer you stay. For example, five-day, one-park-per-day tickets average $643 (that\u2019s $129 per day).\n\nDisney World price per person 1-day, 1-park ticket advertised price range $109 to $189. Average 1-day, 1-park ticket price $160. Lightning Lane Multi Pass Starting at $15.\n\nSome travelers might opt for upgrades like Park Hopper tickets, which let you visit multiple parks each day, or Lightning Lanes, which are priority queues for certain attractions.\n\nNot accounting for upgrades, here\u2019s how much a family of four can expect to spend on tickets, based on the number of theme park days:\n\nFamily of 4 average Disney World ticket cost 1 day $713. 2 days $1,265. 5 days $2,572.\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as family tickets to Disney World; tickets are sold per person. Disney automatically discounts ticket prices for kids under age 9 (those under age 3 don\u2019t need a ticket at all), so families with young children might see slightly lower overall ticket costs.\n\nDisney World hotels\n\nThe \"Alice in Wonderland\"-themed water play area at Disney\u2019s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. (Photo courtesy of Disney)\n\nRooms at All-Star properties (which are considered Value hotels) start at $128 per night, according to Disney trip planning website Touring Plans. Meanwhile, nightly rates for one of Disney World\u2019s most expensive Deluxe hotels, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, start at $780.\n\nExact prices vary based on check-in date and property, but here are average prices broken down by type and trip length, according to NerdWallet\u2019s analysis:\n\nAverage Disney World hotel room costs 1 night 3 nights 7 nights Value $286. $834. $1,727. Moderate $366. $1,091. $2,449. Deluxe $877. $2,646. $6,096.\n\nThe $286 average rate for Disney\u2019s cheapest rooms still exceeds the average hotel room rate off-property. According to Visit Orlando\u2019s 2022 Travel Industry Indicators, Orlando\u2019s average daily room rate is just $186.49, about 35% less than the cheapest room at a Disney resort.\n\nDisney World food\n\nNerdWallet also calculated the average meal prices depending on restaurant type. Meals consisted of an entree and drink and, at waiter service restaurants, an appetizer or dessert.\n\nAverage Disney World food costs Restaurant pricing tier Average food prices per person, per meal (including tax and tip) Value (counter service or cart) $19. Moderate (table service with waitstaff, casual restaurant) $59. Deluxe (table service with waitstaff, fancy restaurant) $93.\n\nHowever, these Disney food prices did not account for kids meals, which are usually cheaper.\n\nConsider one of the best family restaurants at Disney World, the African-inspired buffet at Tusker House Restaurant, located in the Animal Kingdom theme park. Dinner, which features walkaround Disney characters in safari garb, costs $59 (before tax and tip) for ages 10 and up. But kids under 9 can eat for $38 (a 35% discount), and children under 3 eat for free.\n\nTusker House Restaurant at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom Theme Park. (Photo courtesy of Disney)\n\nSatu'li Canteen, located in the \u201cAvatar\u201d section of the theme park, is another family-favorite restaurant in Animal Kingdom. It's famous for its cheeseburger pod, which is a bao bun stuffed with classic cheeseburger ingredients. The adult serving costs $13.29 while the smaller kids version is just $8.59 \u2014 also a 35% discount.\n\nOther activities and expenses\n\nFood, tickets and hotels are hardly the only Disney family trip costs. NerdWallet\u2019s calculations did not account for sundries and souvenirs, which might add to the average cost for a trip to Disney.\n\nNerdWallet\u2019s seven-day trip estimations did account for other entertainment and activities. Disney officially refers to these activities as its Enchanting Extras Collection, which includes animal encounters, educational classes and recreational activities.\n\nPrices for Disney Enchanting Extras vary, though there\u2019s something for every budget. The 60-minute Caring for Giants tour at Animal Kingdom costs just $35 per person and gets you closer to the elephants than other park guests are allowed.\n\nFamilies looking to splurge might book the three-hour private Wild Africa Trek tour, which costs $199 per person and involves hiking, off-roading in a safari vehicle and traversing a rope bridge.\n\nAt the Magic Kingdom, families with very young children might book the My First Haircut package at Harmony Barber Shop. For $28, you get a haircut plus commemorative Mickey Ears, a certificate and a keepsake lock of hair. Kids from ages 3 to 12 might prefer the stylings at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique. For $100, they get a fresh hairdo plus makeup, nail polish and a princess sash, while the $200 package includes a full princess gown.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing Disney World on a budget, a more affordable Enchanting Extra might include a round of miniature golf at either of Disney\u2019s two courses, which cost just $12 per child or $14 per adult.\n\nFor seven-night trips, here\u2019s how much additional money NerdWallet estimates you should budget, per person, for Disney World extras:\n\nValue: $142.\n\nModerate: $221.\n\nDeluxe: $455.\n\nNot all families will opt for add-on activities, but for longer trips, it would be wise to keep some room in the Disney budget, just in case.\n\nHow families can do Disney World on a budget\n\nA family of four should expect to spend a minimum of $6,000 once on-property for seven nights at Walt Disney World, including food, hotel, theme park tickets and add-ons. But a trip to Disney World can also be done for far less. Here\u2019s how:\n\nCut back on theme park days with free or cheap activities. Book Disney Good Neighbor Hotels, which are family resorts near Disney World that are generally more budget-friendly. Many can be booked on points and miles, ideal if you\u2019ve been stockpiling credit card rewards. Seek Disney World family vacation packages, many of which are offered through Good Neighbor hotels.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo better understand the average cost of a vacation to Disney World for a family of four, NerdWallet analyzed more than 200 ticket prices, 550 Disney-owned hotel room rates and more than 100 additional activities and restaurant prices between April 2023 and April 2024. From there, NerdWallet used average costs to build sample trip budgets.\n\nNerdWallet\u2019s trip costs start once you\u2019re on-property, thus don\u2019t account for parking, airfare or driving costs. Here\u2019s what\u2019s included in each price tier:\n\nValue Moderate Deluxe Travel style A budget-minded traveler seeking affordable options, few frills and little to no add-ons. Someone price conscious but who occasionally splurges. Someone who will pay top dollar to access the high end of what Disney offers. Tickets 1-park-per-day tickets. 1-park-per-day tickets with Lightning Lane Multi Pass. 1-park-per-day tickets with Lightning Lane Multi Pass. Hotels Overnight at Disney\u2019s Value hotels. Overnight at Disney's Moderate hotels. Overnight at Disney\u2019s Deluxe hotels. Daily meals 3 meals (1 entree and 1 beverage) at Value counter service restaurants or food carts. 2 Value meals plus 1 Moderate meal (1 entree, 1 dessert or side and 1 beverage) at a casual, table service restaurant with waitstaff. 1 Value meal, 1 Moderate meal plus 1 Deluxe meal at an upscale, table service restaurant with waitstaff. Extra activities Value add-ons, like cheap seats at Disney World\u2019s Cirque du Soleil show or a lower-budget spa treatment (like an express pedicure). Moderate add-ons, like central seats at Disney World\u2019s Cirque du Soleil show or a grand pedicure at the spa. Deluxe add-ons, like front-row seats at Disney World\u2019s Cirque du Soleil show or a full-body massage at the spa.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nBecause Walt Disney World ticket prices vary by park, one-day ticket prices were based on Magic Kingdom admission. Two-day ticket prices were based on Magic Kingdom and Epcot.\n\nNerdWallet\u2019s analysis did not account for Park Hopper tickets, which allow access to multiple theme parks per day.\n\nMeals are based on standard menus. Families ordering from the kids menu will likely save on Disney World food costs.\n\nThese budgets should be used to estimate rather than determine your own Disney trip costs. For instance, you might spend less if you pack your own snacks, or you might spend more if you spring for miscellaneous add-ons (e.g. taxis, Mickey-shaped balloons or PhotoPass).",

There, he will experience everything from signature attractions to dazzling entertainment to popular Disney characters. And it culminates with Hurts leading a colorful parade down Main Street, U.S.A. at Magic Kingdom.\n\nFor Hurts's visit, this marks the second time in recent years that an Eagles player has been a part of Disney's Super Bowl campaign, which began in 1987 when New York quarterback Phil Simms proclaimed he was going to Walt Disney World after the Giants' championship.\n\nHurts' efficient performance in Super Bowl LIX led the Eagles to a 40-22 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in the season's biggest game of the year. He completed 17 of 22 passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns, and added 72 rushing yards, setting a Super Bowl record for rushing yards by a quarterback. It was the ultimate comeback story for Hurts, who lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl two years ago.\n\nHurts joins some of the biggest names in Super Bowl history who have been part of the long-running Disney Super Bowl campaign which started in 1987 when Phil Simms shouted those famous words after the New York Giants won the Super Bowl.\n\nSOURCE Walt Disney World Resort",

That means he will now make his first trip as a champion to the happiest place on earth.\n\nThe Disney tradition continued with Hurts shooting the \"What's Next?\" commercial on the field after his latest Super Bowl victory.

Then comes the famous question from an off-screen narrator.\n\n\"Phil Simms, you have just won the Super Bowl. What are you doing next?\"\n\n\"I'm gonna go to Disney World,\" Simms replies while making his way to the on-field celebration.\n\nBecause of the postgame chaos, and the urgency to complete the commercial so it can air shortly after the celebration, three NFL Films camera crews are sent onto the field to get the shot for the commercial, according to the Los Angeles Times. Players are asked to look into the camera and repeat the lines multiple times, using both Disneyland and Disney World, with the commercial that airs varying in parts of the country depending on proximity to the California and Orlando theme parks.\n\n\u201cI said Disney World and Disneyland, and they said, \u2018Do it again!\u2019 I said, \u2018How many times do I gotta do this?\u2019\" Simms told the Los Angeles Times. \"I didn\u2019t say it meanly, but it was like, I want to shake some hands and enjoy this moment.\u201d\n\nSimms told USA TODAY he was paid $50,000 to do the commercial, and Disney paid for his family's trip to the park.\n\nBut he didn't get his parade until just last year with some help from fellow Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning.\n\nPeyton gave @PhilSimmsQB a few pointers for his first time leading a parade at @WaltDisneyWorld. pic.twitter.com/TyfciB7r9N \u2014 Omaha Productions (@OmahaProd) November 6, 2023\n\nWho starred in the 2024 Disneyland ad?\n\nWhen you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.\n\nThat was certainly the case for Patrick Mahomes.

He returned the following year after a 25-22 overtime win against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMahomes was the sixth player to win multiple Super Bowl MVP awards, but only the third to make multiple Disney trips as Super Bowl MVP. Tom Brady was named Super Bowl MVP five times and has made the most subsequent Disney trips. Eli Manning of the Giants won two Super Bowl MVPs in the \"What's Next?\" era.\n\nJoe Montana of the 49ers won three Super Bowl MVP awards in his career, but two were before the Disney tradition began in 1987.",

After watching the recent trailer for Fantastic Four: First Steps, I am, of course, considering how they could appear at Disneyland, and my idea is not the obvious one.\n\nCertainly, the place the Fantastic Four will almost definitely appear is at Disney California Adventure\u2019s Avengers Campus, the land dedicated to Marvel characters. It\u2019s where every other character in the MCU makes at least the occasional appearance, especially when a new movie or Marvel Disney+ series makes them relevant. However, I don\u2019t want to see the first family of comics at Avengers Campus, or even at DCA. I want to see them at Disneyland\u2019s Tomorrowland.\n\n(Image credit: Disneyland Resort)\n\nDisneyland (And Walt Disney World) Need A More Timeless Tomorrowland\n\nTomorrowland at Disneyland, and for that matter at Walt Disney World, needs help. Honestly, in the 70 years that Disneyland has been around no land has needed more help more often than Tomorrowland. It has an intrinsic problem, because eventually, tomorrow always arrives.\n\nA land dedicated to the future only works when it\u2019s looking forward, so Tomorrowland has needed to evolve to keep pace. The land once had an attraction called Rocket to the Moon, which became a lot less impressive once people had actually done that.\n\nThis problem is well understood at Walt Disney Imagineering. It\u2019s the reason that when Disneyland Paris was built, it was given, not a Tomorrowland, but a Discoveryland. It wasn\u2019t supposed to reflect our actual future, but a steampunk-style future that never came to pass, but had been conceived of in fiction.\n\nDisneyland and Disney World\u2019s Tomorrowland need overhauls to some sort of similar concept. To make them more timeless, they should be removed from time, and placed into a futuristic world that will never exist. Just like the new Fantastic Four movie.\n\n(Image credit: Marvel Studios)\n\nThe Fantastic Four\u2019s Retro-Future Look Belongs In Tomorrowland\n\nAs the recent Fantastic Four trailer shows, the new movie is set in the 1960s, but not the 1960s in our own past. Instead, it will be set in an alternate universe version of the \u201860s that never really existed. It\u2019s a perfect look for Tomorrowland.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nA great deal of Tomorrowland\u2019s look is from the actual 1960s. The Peoplemover opened in 1967. While Space Mountain didn\u2019t open until the 1970s, the attraction was first conceived and designed in the 1960s. Of all the transformations that Tomorrowland might get, doing this would likely be easier and faster than anything else.\n\nTomorrowland doesn\u2019t need to become a \u201cFantastic Four land\u201d it can still be a Tomorrowland, just a different world\u2019s view of tomorrow. But including the Fantastic Four as walk-around characters in such a land would go a long way to reinforce that retro-future vibe we want to achieve.\n\nWhile Tomorrowland will continue to be updated and evolve as all theme park lands do, this update makes future updates less urgent, as Tomorrowland can't fall behind a future that never was and never will be.\n\n(Image credit: Walt Disney Studios)\n\nThe Aesthetic Has A Disneyland Connection Outside Of Marvel\n\nRedesigning an iconic place like Tomorrowland after a single movie, which isn\u2019t even a guaranteed hit yet, may seem like a long shot, but the movie isn\u2019t the only reason that a design like this would actually work well inside Disneyland.\n\nBack in 1964, Disney was a major contributor to the New York World\u2019s Fair. WED Enterprises, the company that became Walt Disney Imagineering, contributed four attractions to the fair, including It\u2019s a Small World, Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, the iconic Carousel of Progress, and the Ford Magic Skyway, which used the Omnimover technology that would become part of multiple Disneyland attractions. Those attractions, and their design elements, would go on to become part of Disneyland, and then Walt Disney World.\n\nBack in August, I attended a panel at D23 about the 1964 World\u2019s Fair, and surprise guest Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, spoke about how the design elements of the fair were specific inspirations for the look of Fantastic Four. He said\u2026\n\nRight now, we\u2019re doing a movie called Fantastic Four: First Steps, and that entire movie is inspired in large part by the optimism and the forward-looking nature of the \u201864 World\u2019s Fair. We have giant sets built right now in London of New York City. And what we had said is, 'Imagine if, in the - we call it a retro-future look - that in the \u201860s it wasn\u2019t just a World\u2019s Fair, that architecture those buildings were not just the World\u2019s Fair, it was the world.' That\u2019s what the Fantastic Four movie is attempting to be.\n\nSo even if you take out the Fantastic Four as characters, the look still has a historical connection to Walt Disney and his creations, making it right for Disneyland. When the day comes that the MCU Fantastic Four is no longer relevant, they can be removed, and the focus of the land can shift to a more general retro-future without actually having to change much, if anything.\n\n(Image credit: Universal Orlando resort)\n\nWalt Disney World Could Get The Same Overhaul, If Disney Shells Out The Money\n\nI\u2019m mostly talking about Disneyland\u2019s Tomorrowland when discussing this idea because, while Magic Kingdom\u2019s Tomorrowland is in need of the same level of TLC as Disneyland, even if Walt Disney Imagineering actually decided to do this in California, making it happen in Florida would be significantly more difficult.\n\nThis is because of the contract that Marvel signed with Universal Destinations & Experiences years before Disney ever bought the House of Ideas. Universal has the rights to most Marvel characters for theme park use, which severely limits which characters Disney can use for attractions.\n\nUniversal\u2019s Islands of Adventure is home to Cafe 4, a quick-service eatery themed after the Fantastic Four. While they don\u2019t have their own attraction or appear as characters in the land, the fact that Universal uses them means Disney World can\u2019t.\n\nThat is, unless Disney and Universal were to come to terms and end the existing contract. There have even been rumors that Universal might be interested in doing exactly that, though it would probably involve Disney paying a chunk of money.\n\nThere\u2019s probably another direction that Magic Kingdom\u2019s Tomorrowland could go that would make it just as timeless, but also unique from Disneyland. Since Disney World has Tron: Lightcycle Run, perhaps something a bit more digital is the way to go there.\n\n(Image credit: Marvel Studios)\n\nBetween the laundry list of new attractions coming to Walt Disney World and the upcoming DisneylandForward project in California. The fact that none of it includes changes to Tomorrowland means it\u2019s probably going to be a long time before anything happens there. And, when it does, it probably won\u2019t be this.\n\nStill, I can dream. When I\u2019m watching the new Fantastic Four movie I expect I'll be wishing this was a place I could visit in a theme park. Maybe, if enough people feel the same way, this might have a chance of happening.",

Learn more about our review process.\n\nDisney World is recognized as \"The Most Magical Place on Earth,\" but it's no secret that the crowds and long lines are one of the drawbacks of visiting the resort. However, for years Disney has offered line-skipping services to help reduce wait times for certain rides. Its current Lightning Lane service gets mixed reviews, ranging from complaints that the added cost on top of an already expensive park ticket feels unfair, to others saying it's absolutely worth the price to ensure a smooth, ride-filled day at the parks.\n\nAs an Annual Passholder and someone who regularly covers Disney World tips for families at Good Housekeeping, I've been helping my friends and family strategize their Lightning Lane plans for years. The bad news? This newest iteration is a bit more complicated than its predecessors, FastPass+ and Genie+. The good news: Once you're equipped with a few simple tips and have a booking strategy, it's actually pretty easy to coordinate. Here, I'm breaking down everything you need to know, including strategies that I've found to be the most effective at scheduling high-priority rides.\n\n\n\nLightning Lanes Types and Costs\n\nDisney.\n\nBefore we get into the strategies, it's important to understand the three Lightning Lane offerings. Regardless of which ones you choose, you can only access the Lightning Lane once per ride per day.\n\nLightning Lane Multi Pass This is the service that the majority of the attractions operate under. Most of the tips and tricks in this guide will revolve around maximizing your Multi Pass, as it's the one that requires a booking strategy. The cost varies by park and by day; parks with more ride offerings and days during busier travel times will be most expensive. In general, it typically costs between $15\u2013$35 per person per day. Lightning Lane Single Pass For a few of the most popular rides at Disney World, the Lightning Lane is only available as a Single Pass, meaning you pay a fee for the individual ride. If the ride is available as a Single Pass, you won't be able to access it with the Multi Pass, but you can book both passes at the same time. Rides available on Single Pass include Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and TRON: Lightcycle / Run at Magic Kingdom; Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at EPCOT; Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Disney's Hollywood Studios; and Avatar: Flight of Passage at Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park. These passes will also vary in price, but typically cost between $15\u201320 per person. Note that these Single Pass rides always sell out, so plan to book in advance. Lightning Lane Premier Pass You pay a high fee for access to every Lightning Lane (both Multi Pass and Single Pass) within a park for one day. This option used to be exclusive to guests staying at Disney hotels, but is now open to all visitors. Costs will vary by park and by day, but are typically in the $150\u2013$350 range. The cost is based on how many rides are offered; Animal Kingdom and EPCOT are least expensive, while Hollywood Studios and Magic Kingdom are most expensive. Although it's pricey, guests who use this service say it was well worth it to get on every ride without any stress. Personally, I think this service is most worth it at EPCOT, where you can access high-demand rides that book up quickly without spending an exorbitant amount.\n\nHow it Works\n\nDisney.\n\nHere's the gist of it: Lightning Lane is a paid service that allows guests to skip the standby line for certain attractions at Walt Disney World. (It's also available at Disneyland, but the system works differently and requires less planning.). You purchase the service on the and can book three rides or shows in advance. Then you can continue to book an additional attraction after you redeem each one of your pre-booked selections.\n\nTo redeem, you're given an a one-hour window where you can use your park ticket (whether you use a card, phone or MagicBand+) to scan into the actual Lightning Lane, which is typically located right next to the standby line. Sounds simple? Well it's a bit more complicated than that. Here are few factors that you also need to take into consideration.\n\nRide Availability\n\nIf you purchase the Lightning Lane Multi Pass, you can book three rides in advance; however, you can only pre-book one attraction from a top-tier group of the most popular rides. You then choose the other two (or all three if you prefer) from a group of lower-demand attractions. Also, all three rides have to be pre-booked at the same park.\n\nOnce you redeem any ride, there are no restrictions on which rides you can book that same day. In fact, you can even book from another park if you plan to park hop. Choosing which rides to book is part of the strategy we'll get into below, but for context, here are the rides you can choose from at each park in 2025:\n\nWhen to Book Lightning Lanes\n\nIf you're staying at Disney Resort hotel (as well as the Swan, Dolphin, Swan Reserve and Shades of Green hotels), you can book Lightning Lanes for your entire stay seven days before your check-in date at 7am EST.\n\nIf you're not staying at a Disney hotel but you do have a date-based park ticket, you can book Lightning Lanes for your entire stay three days before the first date of your package at 7am EST.\n\nAll other guests (including Disney Annual Passholders not staying at a Disney hotel) can book three days before their park visit at 7am EST.\n\nA tip: Make sure you have the My Disney Experience app downloaded and your travel party set up on your account before it's time to book your rides. You should also make sure your credit card is saved and you spend time familiarizing yourself with the app so you can book quickly on your reservation day. It's pretty intuitive once you access the booking platform. Also note that the app gives you an automated suggested time slot based on the rides you select, but you can click to see all available times and choose what works best for your schedule.\n\nDos & Don'ts\n\nLEXIE SACHS\n\n\u2705 DO: Make a plan, or at least have a sense of your park schedule and priority rides. It'll be overwhelming to figure all of that out once it's your time to book, and time wasted on your booking day could cost you ride reservations.\n\n\u2705 DO: Book a \"burner ride,\" meaning a low-demand ride that's easy to reserve first thing in the morning. This helps because at most parks, you can only pre-book one high-demand ride per day. Once you scan into that burner ride, you can then book another high-demand ride before it books up.\n\n\u2705 DO: Consider whether you plan to park hop (i.e., visit another park at Disney World in the same day). You can only pre-book at one park per day, but once you're in that park, you can book an attraction at another one. So if you start at Magic Kingdom then decide to take the monorail over to EPCOT, it may be worth booking rides at EPCOT while you're still at Magic Kingdom.\n\n\u2705 DO: Keep an eye on timing if you want to get on a ride earlier than what you initially reserved. You're allowed to change rides and timing after you book, so you may find an earlier slot opens up. It's also okay to change your mind if you want to switch ride reservations (pending availability) at any point.\n\n\u274c DON'T: Pre-book shows, even though some have Lightning Lanes. The only benefit is that you get to enter the theater first for a better seat, but it's better to save these advanced bookings for a ride that lets you skip a long line. Not to mention, you end up wasting time by entering the theater early.\n\n\u274c DON'T: Proceed with your purchase if the rides you want are unavailable. You reserve your rides before you pay, so if you find that by the time you book (especially if you're not staying at a Disney hotel) the ride you were hoping to reserve is sold out, it may not be worth the cost of Lightning Lane that day. This way you don't pay then find that you're disappointed with what you reserved.\n\nBooking Strategy by Park\n\nAlexis Safranko\n\nThe Lightning Lane Multi Pass strategy will vary based on your travel group, so these tips are more general based on what books up fastest and which ones have the longest lines (or in some cases, virtual queues, meaning you can't access the standby line without a reservation). Keep in mind that you know your group the best, so it's ultimately up to you to decide prioritize your \"can't miss\" rides.\n\nMagic Kingdom\n\nPrioritize Tiana's Bayou Adventure , as this ride will likely book up the fastest and it's only available by virtual queue, meaning if you don't have access to the Lightning Lane, you then have to try to book a standby line spot that day. If you want to avoid a ride with a big drop, opt for Peter Pan's Flight or Jungle Cruise.\n\n, as this ride will likely book up the fastest and it's only available by virtual queue, meaning if you don't have access to the Lightning Lane, you then have to try to book a standby line spot that day. If you want to avoid a ride with a big drop, opt for or Magic Kingdom offers a long list for the other attractions, so opt for whatever your party is most interested in: Some are especially great for young kids, while others are more geared towards older kids and adults. My best tip would be to avoid booking attractions with the lowest wait times because they'll be easier to access that day, including Mad Tea Party, Mickey\u2019s PhilharMagic and Monsters Inc. Laugh Floor.\n\nFIND OUT MORE A Look Inside Tiana's Bayou Adventure\n\nEPCOT\n\nPrioritize Remy's Ratatouille Adventure because its Lightning Lane becomes fully booked quickly and this ride always has a long wait time. If you have a Frozen fan in your group, opt for Frozen Ever After because it's a close second for Lightning Lane filling up and having long wait times.\n\nbecause its Lightning Lane becomes fully booked quickly and this ride always has a long wait time. If you have a Frozen fan in your group, opt for because it's a close second for Lightning Lane filling up and having long wait times. For the other two, there's not a long list to choose from at this park, but I recommend Spaceship Earth and Mission Space, as the others typically have lower waits and are easy to book once you start redeeming.\n\nHollywood Studios\n\nPrioritize Slinky Dog Dash if your group is a fan of roller coasters. If not, prioritize Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway , which is one of the relatively newer rides at this park. And if you're a Star Wars fan, opt for Millennium Falcon .\n\nif your group is a fan of roller coasters. If not, prioritize , which is one of the relatively newer rides at this park. And if you're a Star Wars fan, opt for . For the other two, prioritize Toy Story Mania! and either Twilight Zone Tower of Terror or Alien Swirling Saucers, depending on your group.\n\nAnimal Kingdom\n\nThere's only one group for Animal Kingdom attractions, rather than two tiers. Opt for Kilimanjaro Safaris, Expedition Everest (for roller coaster fans) and Na\u02bbvi River Journey.\n\nHow it Compares to Genie+\n\nThe current Lightning Lane system and Genie+ (i.e., the line skipping service from 2021-2024) have some similarities, including the types of rides available and the cost for the day. Here's how the two differ:\n\nWhen to book: Currently you pre-book Lightning Lanes days in advance, but previously with Genie+ you booked at 7am the morning of your park visit.\n\nCurrently you pre-book Lightning Lanes days in advance, but previously with Genie+ you booked at 7am the morning of your park visit. How many rides you can book: With Genie+ you could book one attraction at a time or every two hours, whichever came first. With the current system, you can have three rides booked at any given time, and there are pre-booking tiers that didn't exist before.\n\nWith Genie+ you could book one attraction at a time or every two hours, whichever came first.

Lightning Lane currently gives priority to guests staying at Disney hotels.\n\nGenie+ was equally accessible for every guest, regardless of where they stayed. Lightning Lane currently gives priority to guests staying at Disney hotels. Character meets: You were able to use Genie+ for certain character meet & greets in the parks, including Mickey Mouse and Disney Princesses. This option is no longer available with the current system.\n\nShort Line Hacks (Without Lightning Lane)\n\nLEXIE SACHS\n\nWhether you don't want to pay for Lightning Lane, don't want to deal with the headache of booking rides or are worried that you won't get good reservations because you're not staying at a Disney hotel, here are a few tips to help you avoid spending time in long lines.\n\nVisit parks on days they close early\n\nThis tip is especially good for families with young kids. Some parks have nighttime ticketed events \u2014 like Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party and Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party \u2014 where they close a few hours early. As a result, people with park tickets are less likely to visit that day, especially if they want to stay late and see the nighttime entertainment with fireworks. However, if you get to the park in the morning and are okay leaving by early evening, this works to your benefit because you'll find fewer crowds than usual.\n\nOpt for nighttime events instead of park days\n\nSimilarly, you can avoid long lines by buying tickets to limited-time night events, including Disney After Hours, where you pay to access the park late at night after it closes. These events are pricey and can cost over $150 a ticket, but that cost is usually on par with a day park ticket and comes with limited admission for shorter wait times at popular rides. It also offers other perks, including some complimentary treats. These events are typically best for teens and adults since to get the full benefit, you should expect to stay up late.\n\nBook your trip during non-peak seasons\n\nThe best time to visit Disney World is when there are no school breaks; even long holiday weekends can draw in bigger crowds. If you have flexibility on when to visit, you'll find non-holiday times will have the shortest wait times. This is especially true shortly before it gets busy, like before spring breaks and in early December as parents are less likely to pull kids from school right before a big break. Not to mention, flights and hotel rooms will cost less, too.\n\nArrive early or stay late\n\nA common tactic to get on popular rides is called \"rope drop,\" which means you arrive at the park before it officially opens. That way you're already inside the park and when the rope drops, you can head right towards the ride. The downside is that many people have this idea and you may end up standing in the rope drop line for a while. So although it helps you get a ride out of the way first thing, it doesn't always save you time overall. On the flip side, entering a ride during the firework shows or right before the park closes can help you find a slightly reduced wait time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlthough it's annoying to pay extra for Lightning Lanes, it's usually worth it. That being said, it's not always a straightforward decision. If you're visiting Disney World during a busy time and want to get on as many rides as possible, it's worth prioritizing your purchases on Lightning Lanes and finding other ways to save money, like buying food and beverages from a local grocery store to spend less on meals and snacks in the parks.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that even if you have to wait in a line, you're not always just standing around. Especially with the newer and most popular rides, Disney finds ways to make the even the lines engaging and entertaining. And regardless of whether or not you end up purchasing Lightning Lanes, one thing I always tell Disney World goers is to remember that it's a vacation, not a bucket list. Try to do as much as possible, but don't spend your trip stressing by trying to fit in every single attraction.\n\nMeet Your Walt Disney World Guide\n\nLexie Sachs is the executive director of strategy and operations at the Good Housekeeping Institute, where she oversees travel content ranging from the best luggage to Good Housekeeping's Family Travel Awards.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer spent nearly all of his show discussing stocks. As has been the case with most of his morning appearances in 2025, he discussed Wall Street's favorite GPU stock in quite a bit of detail. While we've covered a lot of his remarks in our coverage of the stock in our next list, some points are worth mentioning in the introduction.\n\nWhile Wall Street is focused on whether cloud and data center spending for the firm will materialize after China's DeepSeek purportedly demonstrated lower training costs and by effect lower spending requirements, Cramer is focused on the firm's Blackwell GPU.\n\nFor Cramer, while the Blackwell GPU is an impressive product, the timeline of its orders materializing is surprising. He commented on a recent share price target reduction by Citi to share that the only significant takeaway for him from the note concerned the orders. Before he read the note, Cramer kept \"thinking that Blackwell, which is the next generation, is selling like mad.\" However, reading the note surprised him as he learned that the first customer was only starting to receive the products. This leads Cramer to conclude that the money from the latest AI GPUs that the firm earns is \"going to be much more forward and not now in front of us.\"\n\nYet, he remains optimistic because the orders will materialize as Cramer believes \"because obviously if you're spending all this money you're gonna get Blackwell.\" The CNBC host then shifted the conversation to the importance of the Blackwell GPUs. After analyzing the GPU orders, \"you say to yourself, why do you need Blackwell? Why do you need this incredibly important platform that has software?\" he wondered.\n\nThe answer to this question, according to Cramer is because \"you need it [Blackwell] for both inference and you need it for training,\" even though according to him \"There are people who said with DeepSeek you don't.\"\n\nThe GPU orders are particularly important when we analyze Cramer's first remarks for the GPU stock after the DeepSeek stock market selloff. Orders are one key metric that Cramer believes investors should watch to confirm whether the damage done by the selloff is permanent. In a recent morning appearance, he outlined that \"any [GPU] order pullback\" is a key metric along with a potentially reduced focus on energy spending.",

            "content": "Disney World is one of the most popular tourist destinations, but it can also be very expensive. If you\u2019re paying the standard prices, how much should you expect to pay to visit Disney World?\n\nA NerdWallet analysis sought to find out how much a trip to Disney World costs, accounting for line items across these four categories:\n\nPark tickets (and add-ons, like Lightning Lanes).\n\nOn-property hotel room rates.\n\nFood at park restaurants.\n\nAdd-on activities, like spa treatments and tours.\n\nSince you can experience Disney World on a range of budgets, NerdWallet categorized trips into three price tiers: Value, Moderate and Deluxe (the same classification that Disney World uses for its hotels).\n\nThose variations are accounted for in NerdWallet\u2019s price breakdown below (and you can read more about NerdWallet\u2019s methodology at the end of this piece).\n\nBut in general, here\u2019s what you can expect to spend on a Disney World trip per day, per person, based on travel style:\n\nValue Moderate Deluxe 1-day, 1-park theme park ticket $160. $175. $175. 1-night hotel room (Saturday night) $286. $366. $877. Individual meal $19. $59. $93.\n\nAssuming you had three meals per day and shared a hotel room with one other person, here\u2019s how much you should expect to spend in total per day, per person across those three line items:\n\nValue-style traveler: $360.\n\nModerate-style traveler: $455.\n\nDeluxe-style traveler: $785.\n\nIf those figures seem eye-popping, well, they are. But a frugal traveler shouldn\u2019t necessarily look at the $360 daily price tag and multiply it by five to assume they need $1,800 to spend five days at Disney for one person. Seriously, check out this 5-day Disney trip for two people for just $1,600.\n\nFor starters, bulk pricing applies to many facets of your vacation budget \u2014 namely hotels and park tickets \u2014 as the average price per day drops the longer you stay. Lately, there\u2019s a steady stream of available discounts to make your trip more affordable (particularly if you\u2019re willing to travel during shoulder season). And if you\u2019re willing to stay at a non-Disney-owned hotel (many are within walking distance of Disney World and can be booked on points), your overall trip cost might end up being a fraction of what\u2019s quoted above.\n\nHere\u2019s a deep dive into Disney World trip costs \u2014 and how you might save in each category.\n\nDisney World ticket prices\n\nThe entrance to Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at Epcot. (Photo by Sally French)\n\nDisney World ticket prices vary by park and date, but one-day tickets for the Magic Kingdom (typically the most expensive of Disney\u2019s four parks) average $160.\n\nPrices drop the longer you stay \u2014 for example, five-day, one-park-per-day tickets average $643 (that\u2019s $129 per day).\n\nDisney World price per person 1-day, 1-park ticket advertised price range $109 to $189. Average 1-day, 1-park ticket price $160. Lightning Lane Multi Pass Starting at $15.\n\nSome travelers might opt for upgrades like Park Hopper tickets, which let you visit multiple parks each day, or Lightning Lanes, which are priority queues for certain attractions.\n\nDisney World hotel costs\n\nThe lobby of Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. (Photo by Sally French)\n\nTypically, the most affordable hotel rooms can be booked at Disney\u2019s All-Star properties, (which are considered Value hotels). Rooms start at $168 per night, according to Disney trip planning website Touring Plans.\n\nOn the high end are the Deluxe hotels. Among the most iconic of them is Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, where room rates start at $904.\n\nExact prices vary based on when you visit and the individual property and room, but here are average prices broken down by type and trip length, according to NerdWallet\u2019s analysis:\n\nAverage Disney World hotel room costs 1 night 3 nights 7 nights Value $286. $834. $1,727. Moderate $366. $1,091. $2,449. Deluxe $877. $2,646. $6,096.\n\nThe $286 average rate for Disney\u2019s cheapest rooms still exceeds the average hotel room off-property. According to Visit Orlando\u2019s 2022 Travel Industry Indicators, Orlando\u2019s average daily room rate is just $186.49, about 35% less than the cheapest Disney resort.\n\nBut a higher sticker price than average doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a bad deal. Among the best perks of staying at a Disney resort include complimentary parking at Disney theme parks (which costs everyone else $30).\n\nDisney hotel guests are also allowed to enter the parks earlier, which is a prime opportunity to get in line for the most popular rides before the queues get too long. For the time-is-money crowd, that could be an especially valuable benefit.\n\nDisney World food costs\n\nThe Epcot Food and Wine Festival sells small plates \u2014 with lower prices than your normal entree. This dish, dubbed Spam Sushi, went for $6 at the 2023 edition of the festival. (Photo by Sally French)\n\nLike the hotels, Disney World food varies widely in price and quality. You could order a turkey leg for less than $15 from a food cart or pay more than $30 for a salad at one of Disney World\u2019s most expensive restaurants, The Hollywood Brown Derby.\n\nTo better understand Disney World food costs, NerdWallet also priced out average meals depending on restaurant type. Meals consisted of an entree and drink and \u2014 at waiter service restaurants \u2014 an appetizer or dessert.\n\nAverage Disney World food costs Restaurant pricing tier Average food prices per person, per meal (including tax and tip) Value (counter service or cart) $19. Moderate (table service with waitstaff, casual restaurant) $59. Deluxe (table service with waitstaff, fancy restaurant) $93.\n\nHow much should I budget for activities and expenses at Disney World?\n\nThe three costs cited above \u2014 food, tickets and hotels \u2014 are hardly the only Disney World trip costs. Because other line items like sundries and souvenirs can be highly personal, NerdWallet\u2019s calculations did not factor those in.\n\nYou might want to consider other potential expenses, like transportation. While Disney\u2019s transportation within the resort is free, you might end up paying if you don\u2019t want to wait or share a bus with others.\n\nThere are other activities and entertainment that aren\u2019t imperative, and Disney officially refers to them as part of its Enchanting Extras Collection. These tend to be more personalized, unique experiences such as animal encounters, educational classes and recreational activities.\n\nYou could pay as little as $35 per person for a 60-minute Caring for Giants tour at Animal Kingdom, or choose a three-hour, private Wild Africa Trek tour, which costs $199 per person and involves hiking, off-roading in a safari vehicle and traversing a rope bridge.\n\nSome families with very young children might head to the Magic Kingdom\u2019s Harmony Barber Shop. For $28, you get a haircut plus commemorative Mickey Ears, a certificate and keepsake lock of hair \u2014 ideal for a first haircut.\n\nAt the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, expect to pay at least $100 for your kid to get a fresh hairdo plus makeup, nail polish and a princess sash. The $200 package includes a full princess gown.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo better understand how much it costs to go to Disney World, NerdWallet analyzed more than 200 ticket prices, 550 Disney-owned hotel room rates and more than 100 additional activities and restaurant prices between April 2023 and April 2024. From there, NerdWallet used average costs to build sample trip budgets.\n\nNerdWallet\u2019s trip costs start once you\u2019re on property, thus don\u2019t account for parking, airfare or driving costs. Here\u2019s what\u2019s included in each price tier:\n\nValue Moderate Deluxe Travel style A budget-minded traveler seeking affordable options, few frills and little to no add-ons. Someone price conscious but who occasionally splurges. Someone who will pay top dollar to access the high end of what Disney offers. Tickets (Disney World) 1-park-per-day tickets. 1-park-per-day tickets with Lightning Lane Multi Pass. 1-park-per-day tickets with Lightning Lane Multi Pass. Hotels (Disney World) Overnight at Disney\u2019s Value hotels. Overnight at Disney's Moderate hotels. Overnight at Disney\u2019s Deluxe hotels. Daily meals (Disney World) 3 meals (1 entree and 1 beverage) at Value counter service restaurants or food carts. 2 Value meals plus 1 Moderate meal (1 entree, 1 dessert or side and 1 beverage) at a casual, table service restaurant with waitstaff. 1 Value meal, 1 Moderate meal plus 1 Deluxe meal at an upscale, table service restaurant with waitstaff. Extra activities (Disney World) Value add-ons, like cheap seats at Disney World\u2019s Cirque du Soleil show or a lower-budget spa treatment (like an express pedicure). Moderate add-ons, like central seats at Disney World\u2019s Cirque du Soleil show or a grand pedicure at the spa.

Two-day ticket prices were based on Magic Kingdom and Epcot.\n\nNerdWallet\u2019s analysis did not account for Park Hopper tickets, which allow access to multiple theme parks per day.\n\nMeals are based on standard menus. Families ordering from the kids menu will likely save on Disney World food costs.\n\nThese budgets should be used to estimate rather than determine your Disney trip costs. For instance, you might spend less if you pack your own snacks, or you might spend more if you spring for miscellaneous costs (e.g., taxis, Mickey-shaped balloons or PhotoPass).",

            "content": "The Walt Disney Company NYSE: DIS is deep amid a business and market reversal that will increase its stock price by a high-double-digit to low-triple-digit amount over the next 12 to 18 months. The turnaround is driven by its CEO, Bob Iger, who has reinvigorated businesses, reclaimed operational quality, and set the entertainment company on a trajectory of sustained market-leading growth.\n\nWalt Disney Today DIS Walt Disney $98.73 +1.86 (+1.92%) 52-Week Range $83.91 \u25bc $123.74 Dividend Yield 1.01% P/E Ratio 32.16 Price Target $125.64 Add to Watchlist\n\nThe Q1 results highlight the strength of the portfolio despite the impact of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Milton and Helene. While its domestic park business was impacted, business was good internationally, and other strengths were seen. The Entertainment segment grew by nearly 9% yearly due to strength in numerous subsegments, including the studios, which boasted last year's top three box office hits.\n\nGet Walt Disney alerts: Sign Up\n\nAnother area of strength was the sports segment, including ESPN. This segment grew 24% sequentially and 0.4% year over year, with a notable improvement in operating performance. The company logged profits for this segment, offsetting losses in the prior year period, and is on track to sustain profitable growth over the coming years. Among the highlights from the earnings call were details about the soon-to-be-launched ESPN DTC offering. Mr. Iger called it a sports lover's dream, including personalized interfaces, fantasy leagues, and betting services. It and a password-sharing crackdown are expected to accelerate growth in 2026.\n\nDisney\u2019s Beat-and-Raise Quarter Drives Analysts to Lift Price Targets\n\nDisney had a solid quarter in FQ1 2025 with revenue of $24.7 billion, up more than 5% year-over-year. The revenue also outpaced MarketBeat\u2019s reported consensus by 60 basis points and is compounded by margin strength. The company improved its operating profits in every segment except experiences, and there are mitigating factors involved. They include the impact of hurricanes on domestic business and preopening costs in the cruise subsegment.\n\nWalt Disney MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 96th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 27.3% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Moderate Environmental Score -0.46 News Sentiment 0.70 Insider Trading N/A Proj. Earnings Growth 12.07% See Full Analysis\n\nThe future impact of hurricanes is impossible to forecast, but the preopening costs are seasonal and soon out of the picture. Regardless, Q1 consolidated earnings were good, and strength is expected to continue. GAAP and adjusted figures were up by high double-digit amounts and ahead of the consensus forecasts. Regarding the guidance, the company forecasts high double-digit income growth to persist through the end of the year, which has led the analysts to raise the consensus stock price target.\n\nThe analysts' response to the news is a tailwind for the stock price. MarketBeat tracked five revisions within the first two days of the Q1 release, including four price target increases and a single price target reduction. However, all stock targets exceed the critical resistance target, and the bulk leads to the high-end range near $147. That\u2019s a 25% increase from the critical resistance and a target easily reached, given the cash flow, capital return, and valuation. Disney isn\u2019t cheap in 2025 but is very cheap, under 15x earnings, relative to 2030\u2019s lowball estimates.\n\nDisney Capital Returns Will Help Drive Its Stock Price Higher\n\nDisney\u2019s dividend isn\u2019t robust, but it is expected to grow robustly over the next two to three years as cash flow improves. The annual increases will catalyze the market; the next one will be done later this year, and repurchases are also in play. The company\u2019s share buybacks are slightly more robust. They reduced the share count by 1% in FQ1 and are expected to continue reducing it as the year progresses. The balance sheet is a fortress with debt and liability falling and equity rising.\n\nDisney\u2019s stock price action showed volatility following the release, but the bullish bias remains. The market faces stiff resistance at the long-term highs, near the top of a trading range, but support at the cluster of moving averages is strengthening. The likely outcome is a move to new highs, which may occur before the middle of the year. In that scenario, this market can continue to move higher until it reaches the next resistance target near $140. Longer-term, assuming the Iger Effect continues to drive operational results, growth, and analysts' sentiment trends, will likely lead this market back to all-time high levels, a gain of more than 75% from the critical support targets.\n\nBefore you consider Walt Disney, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Walt Disney wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Walt Disney currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

As a result of Hurricane Milton, Walt Disney World Resort was closed for a day, and we canceled a cruise itinerary,\" Disney said in a statement.\n\nHurricane Helene made landfall along Florida\u2019s Big Bend region in September, while Milton took a more southerly path over Central Florida in October.\n\nHURRICANE MILTON\u2019S MARK ON TROPICANA FIELD IN FLORIDA HIGHLIGHTS NEED FOR STRONGER STADIUMS\n\nDespite the extreme weather, no major damage was reported to any of Disney\u2019s Orlando-area properties, but other industries across Florida were not as fortunate.\n\nThe state\u2019s agricultural industry suffered more than $1 billion in losses due to Hurricane Milton, with crops such as strawberries, melons and citrus bearing the brunt of the damage.\n\nThe Category 3 storm made landfall just south of Tampa Bay, causing widespread damage from coast to coast, totaling more than $30 billion. The damage also included the impacts of more than 40 tornadoes that affected communities far from the hurricane\u2019s center.\n\nDisney leaders did not say whether they expect the 2025 hurricane season to have a significant impact on operations, but the company is closely watching the opening of Universal\u2019s Epic Universe in May.\n\nThe more than 700-acre site will become at least the eighth major theme park attraction in Central Florida.\n\nFLORIDA\u2019S CITRUS GROWERS BRACE FOR SMALLEST PRODUCTION IN 95 YEARS FOLLOWING HURRICANES, DISEASE\n\nSimilar to SeaWorld, Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and others, the new park\u2019s operations will be affected by Florida\u2019s daily summer downpours and potential hurricane activity.\n\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season will begin on June 1 and last through November 30, but certain periods of the season tend to be more active than others for the Sunshine State.\n\nThe Peninsula is typically most impacted in October, but activity levels vary from year to year, depending on how atmospheric patterns, such as ridges and jet streams, align across the Atlantic basin.\n\nnext Image 1 of 4\n\nprev next Image 2 of 4\n\nprev next Image 3 of 4\n\nprev Image 4 of 4\n\nEarly outlooks for the 2025 hurricane season are predicting slightly above-average activity in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean, though there is higher-than-usual uncertainty due to the status of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\n\nThe ENSO is currently in a La Ni\u00f1a phase, which typically signals an active Atlantic hurricane season, but the pattern is expected to transition into a neutral phase by summer, which could complicate predictions.\n\nThe first named storm of the 2025 season will be Andrea, followed by Barry, Chantal and newcomer Dexter. The name Dexter replaces Dorian, which was retired after the 2019 season.",

            "content": "Michael Eisner (born March 7, 1942, Mount Kisco, New York , U.S.) is an American business and entertainment executive who was known for his role in reviving the fortunes of, successively, the television network ABC , the film studio Paramount Pictures , and the Disney Company .\n\nEisner grew up in a wealthy family and graduated from a private boarding school before studying English literature and theatre at Denison University (B.A., 1964). A summer job working as a page at TV network NBC led to his later employment at NBC logging the times that advertisements aired. Eisner then moved to the programming department of CBS, where he was in charge of the placement of ads in children\u2019s shows. In 1966 Eisner was hired, through the good offices of Barry Diller, as an assistant to ABC\u2019s national programming director, and he soon proved his worth, rising to become vice president for daytime programming by 1971 and senior vice president for prime time production and development in 1976. During this time Eisner was regarded as a driving force behind ABC\u2019s rise from the bottom of the network rating ranks to the top.\n\nIn 1976 Diller, then chairman of Paramount\u2019s board of directors, hired Eisner as president and chief operating officer of the movie studio. There he helped the company shift its emphasis from distribution to production, and he oversaw the studio\u2019s production of such hit movies as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Footloose (1984). The company\u2019s television wing also grew under Eisner, who helped to produce both Cheers (1982\u201393) and Family Ties (1982\u201389) as well as the syndicated newsmagazine Entertainment Tonight (1981\u2013 ).\n\nEisner was already a star entertainment executive when in 1984 he became chairman and CEO of what was then Walt Disney Productions. The company was struggling to maintain profits, and Eisner acted quickly to improve the situation. He began syndicating the company\u2019s old movies and television shows; approved the production of such popular films as Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986), The Color of Money (1986), and Pretty Woman (1990); and restored Disney\u2019s reputation for classic animation with Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994). He also expanded the company into fields such as television, publishing, home video, and cruise ship travel. Disney\u2019s profits rebounded spectacularly, and Eisner himself became a symbol of the Disney brand. Eisner also oversaw Disney\u2019s 1991 partnership with the computer-animation studio Pixar and its 1993 acquisition of the popular Miramax production company.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, took a moment on Wednesday to reflect on the latest market developments as earnings season progresses, sharing his thoughts on how investors can identify stocks that are unfairly punished and present solid buying opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis market has the memory of a mayfly that creates a ton of opportunities so\u2026 I want to help you find them.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 8 Stocks Recently and 12 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n\nCramer stressed that time and again, he has seen growth stocks severely impacted by minor bits of bad news, such as small downgrades or slight concerns about a quarter\u2019s performance. In these cases, he noted, the punishment rarely fits the crime, if a real issue even exists.\n\nCramer also recently weighed in on the ongoing trade tensions with China. He urged Wall Street to start taking President Trump\u2019s policies more seriously, pointing out that Trump had negotiated a deal that granted China a much lower tariff than Canada received. Cramer dismissed the idea that China\u2019s response was an equal counterattack, calling such a notion \"nonsense\" and \"idiocy.\" He added:\n\n\u201cNow, if Wall Street took Trump seriously, they\u2019d know that China played softball with its retaliation just like Trump played softball with that 10% tariff.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated that much of the recent panic, which had escalated on Sunday night, shifted a bit to optimism, as people began to realize that the president had managed to negotiate a deal. Acknowledging the presence of hardliners within the White House who are keen on taking a tougher stance on China, Cramer noted that those individuals had lost the battle.\n\nHe pointed out that Trump\u2019s objective was to broker a deal that could generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury while providing American businesses with opportunities in China. Cramer emphasized that this goal should have been clear to anyone who had been watching the Chinese stock market, as stocks that trade in China surged recently.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

            "content": "Jason Kelce, family visit Disney World before heading to Super Bowl in New Orleans\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption News in 90: Mayfield election, SpaceX doubleheader and Aldrin Verizon FLORIDA TODAY's Rob Landers brings you some of today's top local headlines on the News in 90 Seconds.\n\nFormer Super Bowl champion Jason Kelce and his family visited Walt Disney World this week, and the dad of three girls, soon-to-be four, said he found the \u201cideal\u201d way to do Disney \u201cwith a bunch of kids.\u201d\n\nThe trick? Visit the Dawa Bar located by the Tusker House Restaurant in Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom. Specifically, for the Ngumu Jungle Juice. The adult beverage, which costs $16.50, contains Snow Leopard Vodka, Bols Peach Schnapps and Tusker's famous Jungle Juice\n\n\u201cIt was perfect. It tasted great,\u201d Kelce said on his Podcast \u201cNew Heights,\u201d which he does with his brother, Travis Kelce. \u201cPerfect level for walking around with a bunch of kids. It was ideal. It really made the safari 10 times better.\u201d\n\nKelce credited a friend for giving him the drink tip.\n\nWhen was Jason Kelce at Walt Disney World?\n\nJason Kelce was in Orlando last weekend to attend the NFL Pro Bowl, which was held Feb. 2 at Camping World Stadium.\n\nThe following day, he went to Walt Disney World with his pregnant wife Kylie, their three daughters and his mom, Donna. Donna lives in the Orlando area and has an annual pass to Walt Disney World.\n\nThere are pictures of the family decked out in Disney gear posing for pictures with Chip and Dale in front of the Tree of Life at Animal Kingdom.\n\nCould the Kelce family return to Disney World soon?\n\nJason is currently in New Orleans to watch Travis , a Kansas City Chiefs tight end, play in Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl against Jason\u2019s former team, the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe game is a rematch of the Super Bowl two years ago when the Kelce brothers played each other in the big game. Kansas City won the game, and went on to repeat last year. This year they are attempting to be the first NFL team to win three straight Super Bowls.\n\nFollowing the Super Bowl in 1987, winning Giants quarterback Phil Simms said the now-famous phrase \u201cI\u2019m going to Disney World.\u201d After that, players from the winning Super Bowl team started going to either Disney World or Disneyland in the days after the game for a parade.\n\nNo word on which coast will welcome the winning player this year, but it\u2019s likely Walt Disney World since it\u2019s closer to New Orleans.\n\nIf Kansas City does win, that means there\u2019s a chance Travis Kelce, a future Hall of Famer, could be the player selected to represent his team at the most magical place on Earth. The younger Kelce also happens to be dating Grammy-award-winning singer Taylor Swift, which has people speculating if she\u2019ll join if there is a celebratory Disney trip.\n\nHow to watch the Super Bowl\n\nThe game against the Chiefs and Eagles will be played Feb. 9 with kickoff at 6:30 p.m.\n\nIt will be broadcast on FOX and streamed on Fubo | Tubi | DirecTV Stream | Sling TV | YouTube TV | Hulu with Live TV.",

Entertainment includes the ABC broadcast network, several cable television networks, and the Disney+ and Hulu streaming services. Within the segment, Disney also engages in movie and television production and distribution, with content licensed to movie theaters, other content providers, or, increasingly, kept in-house for use on Disney's own streaming platform and television networks. The sports segment houses ESPN and the ESPN+ streaming service. Experiences contain Disney's theme parks and vacation destinations and also benefit from merchandise licensing.\n\nWalt Disney's Current Market Status\n\nWith a volume of 8,447,157, the price of DIS is up 1.17% at $111.83.\n\nRSI indicators hint that the underlying stock may be approaching overbought.\n\nNext earnings are expected to be released in 89 days.\n\nProfessional Analyst Ratings for Walt Disney\n\nOver the past month, 3 industry analysts have shared their insights on this stock, proposing an average target price of $128.33333333333334.\n\nUnusual Options Activity Detected: Smart Money on the Move\n\nBenzinga Edge's Unusual Options board spots potential market movers before they happen.

            "content": "InterDigital claims the streaming platforms Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu operated by the Walt Disney Company use advanced video compression that falls within the scope of InterDigital\u2019s patents.\n\nAccording to a press release, InterDigital has filed suits at the United States Federal District Court in the Central District of California (case ID: 2:2025cv00895), Rio de Janeiro State Court in Brazil, at Munich Regional Court in Germany, and at the Unified Patent Court\u2019s local divisions in Mannheim and D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nIn the US complaint, InterDigital claims it reached out to Disney in 2022 to request that the parties discuss the licensing of InterDigital\u2019s patented technologies. But negotiations seemingly failed, as the claimant states that Disney is \u201cstill not authorised to use InterDigital\u2019s patents\u201d. As a result, the patent owner filed the suits against Disney.\n\nIn the US, InterDigital is suing over five video encoding patents (US8,406,301; US10,805,610; US11,381,818; US9,185,268 and US8,085,297). JUVE Patent does not yet know which patents InterDigital is asserting in Europe or the case IDs.\n\nFast streaming\n\nInterDigital claims its video technologies enable Disney to efficiently stream content. Without the solutions in advanced video compression, claims InterDigital, it would take days to download shows and the load of uncompressed data would severely strain the internet.\n\nThe press release states, \u201cUncompressed, a 4K movie with a run time of 130 minutes translates to 11,600GB of data. At modern internet download speeds, it would take over four and a half days to download that movie. Compressed, using the latest technology of which InterDigital is a leading contributor, it is reduced to approximately 14GB, and can be downloaded in a matter of minutes. Without compression, we\u2019d be back to a world of movie rental stores and DVDs by mail.\u201d\n\nIn Disney\u2019s latest financial report for the year ending on 28 September 2024, the company reported annual revenues of nearly $25 billion from its streaming businesses. These count more than 250 million paying subscribers across the different platforms.\n\nStream of litigation\n\nThe importance of streaming is growing as TV viewing habits change. Competition between platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ is fierce. This is giving rise to more litigation over the necessary technology, particularly video coding. Prominent examples include Broadcom vs Netflix, DiVx vs Netflix and Nokia vs Amazon Prime.\n\nFurthermore, various proceedings concerning video coding and streaming technology are also pending at the UPC, including one against Disney. In this case, Adeia Guides is suing the entertainment company over two patents at the local divisions in Munich and The Hague.\n\nEquation with unknowns\n\nInterDigital is once again relying on a team of litigators from Arnold Ruess and patent attorneys from df-mp at both the UPC and the Munich Regional Court.\n\nBoth firms have already successfully represented the client in infringement and nullity actions against Oppo in Germany. Counsels Lisa Rieth Jan Wergin will assist partners and renowned patent litigators Cordula Schumacher and Arno Ri\u00dfe of Arnold Ruess. Dual-qualified Dominik Ho and patent attorney David Molnia of Munich based df-mp provide technical advice.\n\nIn the US, a team from McKool Smith led by Los Angeles litigator Alan Block is representing InterDigital. In Brazil, the company has retained IP practice of full-service firm Licks Attorneys.\n\nJUVE Patent does not yet know which firm Disney has appointed for its defence. In the UPC proceedings against Adeia, a team from Taylor Wessing is representing the group. Munich-based litigator Dietrich Kamlah is in the lead. The team also includes partners Christian Lederer, Michael Sch\u00e4chinger and associate Teresa Gaboardi. Patent attorneys Joel N\u00e4gerl and Lorenz Walder-Hartmann of patent attorney firm Zimmermann & Partner provide support in technical matters.",

            "content": "Disney World is known as the most magical place on earth, and though I wholeheartedly agree, I still find myself battling with my unfortunate bestie; anxiety.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the jitters before a big thrill ride or the stress of making it to a dining reservation on time, anxiety sometimes tags along on my park days. But there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve completely conquered when it comes to park anxiety\u2014and I can\u2019t wait to share with you how I did it!\n\nCharacter meet and greets are a big part of Disney World. From taking pictures with princesses to meeting Mickey Mouse himself, this is an exciting experience you can enjoy at all of the parks. But even though they are so much fun, they can also be just as nerve-wracking. Luckily, one simple thought has helped me master every character interaction\u2014just think of it like a Mickey ice cream sandwich!\n\nYup, you read that right! And if you\u2019re thinking \u201cAngie, what on earth do you mean by that?\u201d\u2014Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019d be more than happy to explain.\n\nThe way I take on character interactions is by viewing it in layers, much like the ones a Mickey ice cream sandwich has. The first layer of a successful meet and greet? A solid greeting! Whether it\u2019s Darth Vader or Snow White, a simple hello is a great start to any interaction.\n\nNext comes the second layer\u2014the sweetest part of the ice cream sandwich: the ice cream! In this case, that means following up your greeting with a question. For certain characters who don\u2019t typically speak, like Figment or Goofy, a simple yes or no question is the perfect choice. Or, if you\u2019re meeting a character who loves to chat, asking a question related to their movie will be a great way to spark a fun interaction!\n\nFor example, if I\u2019m meeting Sulley from Monsters, Inc., I\u2019ll ask him if he\u2019s been up to any other adventures with Mike back at Monstropolis. And if I\u2019m meeting Alice from Alice in Wonderland, I\u2019ll ask her what her favorite tea to serve during her merry unbirthday party is.\n\nAnd finally, the last layer of the character meet-and-greet ice cream sandwich\u2014asking for a photo! For many, the highlight of meeting a character is getting that perfect picture. But if a photo isn\u2019t your thing, no worries! You can ask for an autograph or simply wish them a magical day.\n\nWrap it all up with a thank you and voila! You\u2019ve just nailed a character meet and greet like a pro! How sweet is that? Just like a Mickey ice cream sandwich, if you ask me.\n\nWe\u2019re always sharing our personal experiences to give you the best tips on your next trip to Disney World so stay tuned with us here at AllEars!\n\nJoin the AllEars.net Newsletter to stay on top of ALL the breaking Disney News!

The film saw a preview release in 1937 and a wide release the following year to wild acclaim. The film's release wasn't its only achievement.

            "content": "The Walt Disney Company reported its FY2025 first quarter earnings on Wednesday, with CEO Bob Iger and CFO Hugh Johnston discussing how the company\u2019s results this quarter demonstrate Disney\u2019s \u201ccreative and financial strength as we advanced strategic growth initiatives set in motion over the past two years.\u201d\n\nBusiness Focus\n\n\u201cIn Q1 we saw outstanding box office performance from our studios, which had the top three movies of 2024; we further improved the profitability of our Entertainment DTC streaming businesses; we took an important step to advance ESPN\u2019s digital strategy by adding an ESPN tile on Disney+; and our Experiences segment demonstrated its enduring appeal as we continue investing strategically across the globe,\u201d Iger and Johnston said in an executive commentary on Wednesday.\n\nFilm\n\nIger and Johnston noted that the company\u2019s theatrical releases had an outstanding run at the global box office in calendar year 2024, with Disney becoming the first studio in the industry post-pandemic to surpass $5 billion worldwide. The first quarter continued Disney\u2019s box office hot streak with impressive performances from both Moana 2 (which recently crossed $1 billion globally at the box office) as well as Mufasa: The Lion King generating more than $650 million globally as of this past weekend.\n\nDisney\u2019s studios have also garnered critical success. The company received 15 Oscar nominations \u2014 including eight for Searchlight Pictures\u2019 A Complete Unknown.\n\nWhy It Matters: \u201cWith multiple consumer touchpoints, we continue to generate ongoing, long-term value from our theatrical releases, and we now have more ways to leverage film success than ever before,\u201d Iger and Johnston said.\n\nA prime example of Disney\u2019s dynamic strategy can be seen with Moana. The film franchise is approaching $1.7 billion at the global box office; the 2016 original was the most-streamed movie in the U.S. on any platform for the second year in a row; and characters and stories from the franchise continue to delight guests across Disney\u2019s Experiences segment.\n\nTelevision\n\nOn the smaller screen, the company\u2019s series have also continued to demonstrate widespread popularity and acclaim. In calendar year 2024, Disney had the top four most streamed shows in the U.S., led by Bluey with more than 55 billion minutes viewed on Disney+, along with Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Family Guy, and Bob\u2019s Burgers. Disney also won six Golden Globe Awards, with the epic Sh\u014dgun sweeping all its nominated categories. As for ABC News, it also shined with ABC\u2019s World News Tonight with David Muir being the No. 1 newscast for the ninth year in a row in 2024.\n\nNotable Quote: \u201cWe are especially proud of the remarkable journalists and producers at ABC News and our local affiliate KABC for the work they have done to keep the public informed during the devastating wildfires in Southern California,\u201d Iger and Johnston added.\n\nStreaming\n\nIn December Disney introduced an ESPN tile on Disney+, which provided bundle subscribers with the full range of ESPN+ sports content and select ESPN content available to all Disney+ subscribers (including certain live sports events and games). Iger and Johnston announced that new live sports studio shows that will be exclusive to Disney+ later this year. That includes a daily SportsCenter called SC+.\n\nWhy It Matters: \u201cStreaming remains a success story for the Company as we build Disney+ into the ultimate digital destination for audiences to access the very best we have to offer in film, television, sports, and news \u2014 all in one place,\u201d Iger and Johnston said. \u201cAnd our Q1 Entertainment Direct-To-Consumer results reflected improved profitability.\u201d\n\nSports\n\nIger and Johnston pointed out that live sports have \u201cthe power to convene enormous audiences,\u201d which was shown by the 2024 season of Monday Night Football being ESPN\u2019s second-most-watched in the company\u2019s 19-year history of airing the NFL franchise. Disney\u2019s first season broadcasting the entirety of the SEC schedule was also a hit, contributing to strong ratings across the company\u2019s college football programming. In 2024, ABC averaged 5.8 million viewers for 46 regular season games \u2014 ABC\u2019s best college football season in 15 years.\n\nMore to Know: \u201cESPN\u2019s flagship offering that will launch in early fall has been and remains our priority,\u201d Iger and Johnston said. \u201cAnd we expect the elevated product and content experience \u2014 which will all be housed within the ESPN app \u2014 will be a digital destination for sports fans unlike anything available in the marketplace today, with the full suite of ESPN\u2019s networks and ESPN+, and highly interactive and personalized features.\n\nExperiences\n\nIn Q1, Disney launched the Disney Treasure \u2014 the sixth ship in Disney Cruise Line\u2019s fleet \u2014 and opened Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure at Disneyland Resort. Looking ahead, 2025 is a big year for the company\u2019s Experiences segment with it kicking off Disneyland\u2019s 70th anniversary celebration in May and Hong Kong Disneyland\u2019s 20th anniversary celebration later this year.\n\nWhy It Matters: \u201cOur Q1 results for our Experiences segment demonstrated Disney\u2019s strong and enduring appeal in family travel,\u201d Iger and Johnston said. \u201cWe continue work on a robust slate of new projects as we bring our most popular IP to life in innovative ways and execute against a carefully designed and planned investment strategy. We also remain deliberate about pricing and the guest experience, and are focused on providing guests great value with a vast array of options to visit our theme parks.\u201d\n\nWrap Up\n\nIger and Johnston concluded their executive commentary on Wednesday by saying that the quarter overall proved to be \u201ca strong start to the fiscal year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic about the year to come,\u201d the two said. \u201cAnd we remain confident in our strategy for continued growth.\u201d\n\nThe information above should be read together with Disney\u2019s Q1 FY 25 Earnings Report, Form 10-Q, prepared earnings remarks (executive commentary), and earnings call (all available here), which discuss additional information, including additional challenges and risks the company\u2019s businesses face and additional information about Q1 performance.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements in this communication may constitute \u201cforward\u2010looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, plans, financial prospects, trends or outlook; opportunities for growth and expansion; strategies and strategic priorities and opportunities; expected benefits of new initiatives; value of our intellectual property, content offerings, businesses and assets; and other statements that are not historical in nature.

Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. earned $2.55 billion, or $1.40 per share, for the period ended Dec. 28. The Burbank, California-based company earned $1.91 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the prior-year period.\n\nStripping out one-time charges and benefits, earnings were $1.76 per share, which is 32 cents better than Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $24.69 billion, a bit better than analysts had projected.\n\nRevenue in Disney\u2019s Entertainment segment increased 9%. Revenue for content sales/licensing and Other jumped 34% due to the strong performance of \u201cMoana 2.\u201d\n\nCEO Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said in a prepared remarks that the Moana film franchise demonstrates the strong connection that audiences have with Disney\u2019s stories and characters and further validates the company\u2019s strategy of investing in popular intellectual property.\n\nDisney\u2019s direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, reported quarterly operating income of $293 million compared with an operating loss of $138 million a year ago. Revenue increased 9% to $6.07 billion.\n\nThe Disney+ streaming service had a 1% increase in paid subscribers domestically, which includes the U.S. and Canada. But there was a 2% drop internationally, which excludes Disney+ HotStar. Total paid subscribers for Disney+ dipped 1% in the quarter. Disney also said that it had 125 million Disney+ subscribers in the quarter, a slight decline from the fourth quarter. It had 178 million Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions for the quarter, an increase of 900,000 subscribers from the previous quarter.\n\nIger said during Disney\u2019s conference call that the company is actually very pleased with its subscriber growth for Disney+ and Hulu, particularly because it raised prices.\n\n\u201cDisney\u2019s earnings beat underscores the success of its cost-cutting initiatives and resilient performance in parks and studios, offsetting headwinds in streaming,\u201d Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in an emailed statement. \u201cHowever, the surprising loss of Disney+ subscribers\u2014the first decline since its 2019 launch\u2014raises red flags about saturation in a crowded market and the trade-offs of its pricing strategy.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Disney said that it foresees a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter when compared with the first quarter. The company still anticipates high-single digit adjusted earnings per share growth for fiscal 2025.\n\nThe Experiences division, which includes six global theme parks, its cruise line, merchandise and videogame licensing, reported operating income was basically flat at $3.11 billion. Operating income fell 5% at domestic parks, as hurricanes caused Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida to close for a day and canceled a cruise. Operating income rose 28% for international parks and Experiences.\n\nShares climbed about 1% in morning trading Wednesday.",

Feb. 5, that beat Wall Street's consensus estimates. Analysts had anticipated adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.45, but Disney managed $1.76. The company's Q1 revenue climbed to $24.69 billion, coming in just ahead of the projected $24.67 billion.\n\nThe strong quarter aligns with a strategic shift towards maximizing profitability in streaming and content, although challenges persist in some traditional areas.\n\nMetric Q1 2025 Analysts' Estimate Q1 2024 Change (YOY) Adjusted EPS $1.76 $1.45 $1.22 44% Revenue $24.69 billion $24.67 billion $23.5 billion 5% Operating income $5.06 billion N/A $3.88 billion 31% Cash provided by operations $3.21 billion N/A $2.19 billion 47%\n\nWalt Disney's Business Overview\n\nWalt Disney is a global leader in entertainment, boasting a vast collection of intellectual properties and a diverse portfolio of assets. Its business includes renowned theme parks and resorts, influential media networks, legendary film studios, and a growing presence in the streaming market through platforms like Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu. Central to Disney's strategy is the Direct-to-Consumer segment, which has been instrumental in its recent successes. The company leverages a combination of strong content creation and extensive distribution channels to maintain its position as a market leader.\n\nDisney has focused on expanding its Direct-to-Consumer offerings, leveraging its well-known brands and extensive content library to attract subscribers. Key success factors include the ability to produce engaging content that resonates globally and the strategic alignment of streaming services like Disney+ with other aspects of its entertainment portfolio. Theme parks and experiences continue to provide significant revenue, showcasing the strength and enduring appeal of Disney's brand loyalty.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nDisney delivered notable achievements in fiscal 2025's Q1 despite encountering some hurdles. Total operating income hit $5.06 billion, a 31% jump from last year, with its Direct-to-Consumer segment reaching a positive operating income for the first time. This shift was fueled by increased profitability in its streaming services, even as Disney+ experienced a slight decline in subscribers, dropping by 700,000 to 124.6 million.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer segment's financial gains highlight Disney's strategic pivot toward capitalizing on streaming's dominance. Key developments include a significant revenue increase in Hulu subscriptions (up 3% quarter over quarter), which added 1.6 million new subscribers and now totals 53.6 million. Disney's integration of ESPN's digital initiatives with its streaming offerings underscores this focus.\n\nThe theme parks and experiences segment's operating income remained flat at $3.1 billion as it dealt with lost revenue from natural disasters, but international parks performed strongly with a 28% year-over-year income rise. The recent hurricanes impacted operations, costing Disney approximately $120 million, yet robust international attendance and guest spending mitigated these losses. Disney's commitment to enhancing its cruise line operations anticipates long-term growth with pre-opening expenses as new ships are planned.\n\nDisney's content creation and licensing showed impressive results, with operating income skyrocketing from a loss to $312 million, driven by successful film releases like Moana 2. This illustrates Disney's enduring capability in generating influential content. In the sports segment, a turnaround was observed, recording $247 million in operating income from prior losses. This was attributed to increased ESPN advertising revenue, emphasizing live sports' integral role in Disney\u2019s portfolio.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nGoing forward, Disney anticipates robust growth, with management projecting high single-digit adjusted EPS growth for the current fiscal year. Expectations center on the continued expansion and profitability of its streaming services as pivotal to maintaining its competitive edge. Future directions include further investment in new streaming content, capitalizing on its intellectual property, and enhancing international market penetration.\n\nSignificant shifts are also expected within its Experiences segment, with strategic investments planned for parks and cruise lines. Overall, Disney is positioned for ongoing growth, with strategic content releases and technological advancements anticipated to drive robust financial results in the forthcoming years. The upcoming ESPN+ additions and the harnessing of its DTC segment are expected to elevate consumer engagement and expand revenue streams.",

            "content": "The history of The Walt Disney Company is inextricably linked to the greater Los Angeles region, and the destruction from the devastating fires that have affected thousands in our area is truly heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cThe Walt Disney Company is committed to supporting our community and our employees as we all work together to recover and rebuild from this unbelievable devastation,\u201d said Bob Iger, CEO, The Walt Disney Company. \u201cWalt Disney came to Los Angeles with little more than his limitless imagination, and it was here that he chose to make his home, pursue his dreams, and create extraordinary storytelling that means so much to so many people around the world. We are proud to provide assistance to this resilient and vibrant community in this moment of need.\u201d\n\nThese are some of the many ways that The Walt Disney Company has been working to support its community and employees in the LA area in the aftermath of this crisis.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company committed $15 million for initial and immediate response and rebuilding efforts, supporting vital organizations offering essential services on the ground like the American Red Cross, the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, among others.\n\nBeyond critical relief efforts, Disney is working closely with business and community leaders to find ways to support important rebuilding efforts in the region.\n\nDisney Entertainment Television invited employees, production crew, and their families who lost their homes to its wardrobe warehouse in North Hollywood to collect new or gently used clothing and shoes from recent Disney film and TV productions at no expense.\n\n\u201cMost companies are not sitting on an entire warehouse full of wardrobe \u2014 some of which has been barely used, if it\u2019s been used at all,\u201d said Heidi Chong, Vice President of Production Shared Services for Disney Entertainment Television. \u201cWe really want to emphasize to the families: \u2018If you come here, we\u2019ve already organized everything for you. It\u2019s all on display on the racks. You can find what you need.\u2019 There are no limits to the amounts that people are getting; it\u2019s really about what they need.\u201d\n\nDisney Employee Relief Fund and Housing Assistance\n\nDisney teams have been working diligently to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, many of whom have been impacted by these fires. We\u2019ve infused additional resources into our Disney Employee Relief Fund \u2014 a fund maintained for Cast Members and employees who have been affected by natural disaster or financial hardship \u2014 to help those facing distress because of this crisis. Additionally, Disney has provided both short-term and long-term housing to employees who have been displaced by the fires.\n\nDisney VoluntEARS quickly mobilized to assemble hundreds of Disney-themed comfort kits and care packages \u2014 which included coloring and activity books, plush, and more provided by the Disney Experiences team \u2014 for kids staying in American Red Cross shelters in response to the tragic wildfires that have impacted the Los Angeles area. VoluntEARS also packed boxes of items including books, chairs, games, blankets, and more to help fill the kid\u2019s space in the Pasadena shelter.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one company that can bring a smile to somebody\u2019s face when they\u2019re going through their most difficult time, it\u2019s Disney,\u201d Josh D\u2019Amaro, Chairman, Disney Experiences, said. \u201cYou look at operations like this, where Cast Members are coming together, everyone wants to reach out and help. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do.\u201d\n\nDisney\u2019s historic El Capitan Theatre opened its doors to host complimentary screenings of its latest hits, Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King, to help bring a little happiness to kids and families in the LA community affected by the wildfires.\n\nGeneral Manager James Wood, who has worked at the theatre in various roles since 2001, shared that having these screenings in Hollywood at the El Capitan Theatre, \u201ca place that\u2019s close to 100 years old, really showcases that we are going to keep going, that Los Angeles is a place that is strong, that will continue and will always continue.\u201d\n\nMany across the Los Angeles region have lost homes, belongings, and access to basic necessities, leaving them in urgent need of support. Disney VoluntEARS have worked to collect essential items and make them available to families and individuals impacted by the wildfires with the help of community organizations, including Shelter Partnership, Helping Hands, and LA Unified School District.\n\n\u201cSince the moment this disaster hit, our employees have been asking what they can do to help,\u201d said Lisa Haines, senior vice president, Corporate Social Responsibility, The Walt Disney Company. \u201cThe Disney VoluntEARS team quickly mobilized to put on one of the largest disaster relief drives our company has done, collecting more than 200,000 items from employees and Cast Members across the company. This outpouring of support is just one of the many ways we are coming together to help those who have lost so much.\u201d\n\nDonation drives occurred at The Walt Disney Studios Lot, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Disneyland Resort, and other Disney locations.\n\nAt Boys & Girls Clubs in Los Angeles, Disney helped to bring a bit of happiness and sense of normalcy to children impacted by the devastating wildfires in the region with private screenings of the box office hit Mufasa: The Lion King.\n\n\u201cWhen the team proposed the idea of hosting these screenings for kids who have been impacted by the fires, it was an instant yes \u2014 followed by the question, \u2018And what more can we do?\u2019\u201d shared Cathleen Taff, President, Production Services, Franchise Management & Theatrical Distribution, Disney Entertainment, Studios. \u201cWe know the joy and comfort a Disney movie can bring to a child and their family, and we\u2019re honored to provide that sense of happiness and escape for these kids.\u201d\n\nSome snacks and fun giveaways included Mufasa tumblers, friendship bracelets, and Mickey Mouse rice krispy treats. The goodies were accompanied by a surprise visit from Mickey Mouse himself, whose appearance in Pasadena was met with excitement from kids \u2014 and Boys & Girls Club staff \u2014 as he welcomed them with high fives.\n\nA new Disney LA Strong t-shirt is available for purchase on DisneyStore.com as a symbol of community support, and a reminder that together we have the strength to rebuild and heal. For each t-shirt sold in the U.S. through December 31, 2025, Disney will donate $25 to the American Red Cross to help people affected by the wildfires in California during 2025.\n\nThe idea for the Disney LA Strong t-shirt emerged from the desire of Disney employees to give back and show support to those who have been impacted by the fires. The shirt is a tribute to the Los Angeles community\u2019s resilience \u2014 its strength, spirit, and ultimately its ability to rise above adversity.\n\nTo show appreciation for the brave individuals who responded on the frontlines of the recent fires in Los Angeles, Disneyland Resort is announcing the Heroes Ticket, inviting them and a guest to experience a day of fun at the \u201cHappiest Place on Earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are inspired by the endless dedication and contributions of the heroes who battled the fires that took place in the LA area, and our gratitude for their service is immeasurable,\u201d said Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock. \u201cWe hope these heroes can enjoy a memorable day with a loved one at our parks, because they certainly deserve it.\u201d\n\nMarvel Studios invited nearly 1,000 first responders and their families to attend the Captain America: Brave New World world premiere in Hollywood. Attendees included representatives from CAL FIRE, the City of Pasadena Fire & Police Departments, the Los Angeles County Fire Department, the Los Angeles Fire Department and Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, the Los Angeles Police Foundation, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Deeply connected to the greater Los Angeles area, The Walt Disney Company was honored to host and express its gratitude to these heroic first responders.\n\nAs the greater Los Angeles region works to rebuild in the wake of the destructive fires, our hearts are with everyone across Southern California who has been affected by this tragedy. We want to express our overwhelming gratitude to the heroic firefighters and first responders whose courage and professionalism have been a source of tremendous encouragement and pride. Likewise, we are grateful for the outstanding local reporters at KABC and elsewhere who have been a vital resource to all.\n\nThis community\u2019s strength is rooted in its people, and we are proud to be a part of it and offer our support.

Thanks to improving financial performance and positive market sentiment, the stock has climbed 26% in the last six months. This gain meaningfully outpaces the broader S&P 500.\n\nAs of this writing, shares still trade 44% off their all-time high, which was achieved in March 2021. Investors might believe the business still deserves a closer look. Should you buy Disney stock while it's below $120?\n\nProfitability trending higher\n\nBetween fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2021, Disney's segment operating income was cut in half (Disney's fiscal year ends in September). That's certainly a troubling data point that helps explain why shares are still trading at a sizable discount to their record.\n\nThe company was dealing with a whirlwind of issues. Its historically lucrative cable TV networks are in secular decline due to the rise of streaming video entertainment. Disney did launch direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services, but they were posting massive operating losses in an attempt to scale up. And the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily shut down Disney's theme parks and cruise lines.\n\nHowever, the business appears to now be heading in the right direction. Its DTC segment, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, is now generating positive operating income thanks mainly to cost controls. Management expects the division to post a 10% operating margin (excluding ESPN+) in fiscal 2026, which would be substantially better than fiscal 2024.\n\nThe theme parks and cruise lines, although dealing with softer consumer demand in recent quarters, have bounced back nicely since the pandemic. In fiscal 2024, the segment that also includes consumer products reported 5% year-over-year revenue growth, leading to a 4% gain in operating income. In fact, those two figures were both all-time records.\n\nImpossible to replicate\n\nLong-term investors should want to own businesses that possess an economic moat. Having durable competitive advantages helps protect against the threat of competition and new entrants. In essence, the presence of a moat not only indicates a high-quality company, but it also reduces the risk that a business falls by the wayside.\n\nIn Disney's case, its intellectual property (IP) is undoubtedly what makes up its economic moat. Decades of building stories and franchises and characters have created immense value. Even better, because Disney has so many consumer touch points, it's able to monetize this IP in various ways, whether at the box office, on your home TV, at a theme park, on a cruise, or with consumer products at retail stores.\n\nNo business on Earth has the breadth and depth of IP that Disney possesses. Even if someone had unlimited capital, it would be impossible to copy what Disney has created. That's definitely a fantastic position to be in and one that will benefit the company for a long time.\n\nThink about valuation\n\nEven though Disney shares have been volatile in the past 12 months, they have been trending higher since the summer of last year. However, the valuation is still compelling.\n\nAs of this writing, shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.9. This represents a 6% discount to the overall S&P 500, despite Disney being an above-average company.\n\nAccording to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Disney's earnings per share are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.9% between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2027. That outlook seems reasonable, but consider that analysts have been revising expectations higher, which could make the current forecast look conservative. Improving bottom-line performance should result in the market becoming more optimistic toward the company, leading to a higher forward P/E ratio.\n\nBased on the combination of a positive earnings trajectory and a low starting valuation, Disney almost looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity while it's below $120 per share.",

            "content": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies The Walt Disney Company ( ) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nHow Much Debt Does Walt Disney Carry?\n\nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Walt Disney had US$45.8b in debt in September 2024; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$6.00b in cash leading to net debt of about US$39.8b.\n\nA Look At Walt Disney's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Walt Disney had liabilities of US$34.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$56.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$6.00b as well as receivables valued at US$12.7b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$72.0b.\n\nThis deficit isn't so bad because Walt Disney is worth a massive US$204.5b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.\n\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nWith a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.3, Walt Disney uses debt artfully but responsibly. And the alluring interest cover (EBIT of 7.5 times interest expense) certainly does not do anything to dispel this impression. Importantly, Walt Disney grew its EBIT by 32% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Walt Disney can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Walt Disney produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 51% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, Walt Disney's impressive EBIT growth rate implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And we also thought its interest cover was a positive. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Walt Disney can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Walt Disney has we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out without delay.\n\nIf you're looking to trade Walt Disney , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

Investors might believe the business still deserves a closer look. Should you buy Disney stock while it's below $120?\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nProfitability trending higher\n\nBetween fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2021, Disney's segment operating income was cut in half (Disney's fiscal year ends in September). That's certainly a troubling data point that helps explain why shares are still trading at a sizable discount to their record.\n\nThe company was dealing with a whirlwind of issues. Its historically lucrative cable TV networks are in secular decline due to the rise of streaming video entertainment. Disney did launch direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services, but they were posting massive operating losses in an attempt to scale up. And the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily shut down Disney's theme parks and cruise lines.\n\nHowever, the business appears to now be heading in the right direction. Its DTC segment, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, is now generating positive operating income thanks mainly to cost controls. Management expects the division to post a 10% operating margin (excluding ESPN+) in fiscal 2026, which would be substantially better than fiscal 2024.\n\nThe theme parks and cruise lines, although dealing with softer consumer demand in recent quarters, have bounced back nicely since the pandemic. In fiscal 2024, the segment that also includes consumer products reported 5% year-over-year revenue growth, leading to a 4% gain in operating income. In fact, those two figures were both all-time records.\n\nImpossible to replicate\n\nLong-term investors should want to own businesses that possess an economic moat. Having durable competitive advantages helps protect against the threat of competition and new entrants. In essence, the presence of a moat not only indicates a high-quality company, but it also reduces the risk that a business falls by the wayside.\n\nIn Disney's case, its intellectual property (IP) is undoubtedly what makes up its economic moat. Decades of building stories and franchises and characters have created immense value. Even better, because Disney has so many consumer touch points, it's able to monetize this IP in various ways, whether at the box office, on your home TV, at a theme park, on a cruise, or with consumer products at retail stores.\n\nNo business on Earth has the breadth and depth of IP that Disney possesses. Even if someone had unlimited capital, it would be impossible to copy what Disney has created. That's definitely a fantastic position to be in and one that will benefit the company for a long time.\n\nThink about valuation\n\nEven though Disney shares have been volatile in the past 12 months, they have been trending higher since the summer of last year. However, the valuation is still compelling.\n\nAs of this writing, shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.9. This represents a 6% discount to the overall S&P 500, despite Disney being an above-average company.\n\nAccording to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Disney's earnings per share are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.9% between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2027. That outlook seems reasonable, but consider that analysts have been revising expectations higher, which could make the current forecast look conservative. Improving bottom-line performance should result in the market becoming more optimistic toward the company, leading to a higher forward P/E ratio.\n\nBased on the combination of a positive earnings trajectory and a low starting valuation, Disney almost looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity while it's below $120 per share.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walt Disney wasn\u2019t one of them.

The entrepreneur often told the story of a mouse that lived in his desk drawer at the KC studio. He fed it and taught it tricks, eventually growing so fond of the pet mouse that he immortalized it in the studio\u2019s iconic character.\n\nThough Walt Disney was a visionary in entertainment, he didn\u2019t draw many of his legendary cartoons. For that, he relied on his friend Ub Iwerks \u2014 co-founder of Laugh-O-Gram, and the KC-born artist who invented Mickey Mouse.\n\nPreserving KC\u2019s legacy in animation\n\nThe city planned to demolish the Laugh-O-Gram building near 31st Street and Troost Avenue in early 2000. A local nonprofit, Thank You Walt Disney Inc., managed to save it, initiating a decades-long project to restore and transform the building.\n\nModern developments have largely paved over Disney\u2019s KC history. The ad agency where he and Ub Iwerks met is now a parking lot, and the theater where he showed his first animations became the Lightwell Building. Laugh-O-Gram Studio fell into such disrepair that the first few years of restoration meant simply stabilizing the crumbling structure.\n\nIn February 2023, the nonprofit secured $2 million in federal funding to begin its work in earnest. The project will transform the building into a hybrid historical site, educational center, and working space. Board member Gary Sage describes the nonprofit\u2019s vision to create \u201cNot just a museum of the past. It\u2019s now going to be a museum for the future.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to comment on the DeepSeek fallout. He shared that while the performance of the Chinese AI model was impressive, especially as it had managed to match models such as OpenAI's o1, there were other factors to consider particularly when gauging the demand for high-end Blackwell GPUs. These GPUs are made by Wall Street's favorite AI GPU firm, and Cramer is increasingly starting to tilt towards the fact that their true magic might lie in enabling the proper functioning of humanoid robots.\n\nAs for the stock, the CNBC TV host continued to assert that there is a large chunk of traders that do not properly understand the company. Cramer shared \"I was in a bar last week, person to the right said I bought [the GPU stock] because of you. A person left said I bought [the GPU stock] cause of you.\" He added that in response he asked does \"anyone know what [the GPU stock] does?\" Yet, instead of outlining the firm's business model, \"They said yeah! It's something that you recommend!\" he added.\n\nWhile the GPU company might have lost close to $600 billion in value during the selloff, another AI news caught Cramer's attention. This was a Reuters report that claimed that OpenAI was seeking to raise $40 billion in capital on a $400 billion valuation. When asked how such valuation was possible, particularly after Monday's havoc, Cramer replied \"So I was just being like you. It is, without a doubt, a time not of inflation, but of a recognition.\" He added that this 'recognition' is why he likes the GPU firm as well. So what is the recognition that's got Cramer enamored? Well, according to him \"it's a recognition that it is a new industrial revolution. And anybody who's in it is a worth lot more than the people that aren't!\"\n\nHe also sardonically targeted co-host David Faber and said \"Look I'm sure that when they discovered the cotton gin, and you're a weaver, you're saying you know what, that's ridiculous!\" Not satisfied, Cramer continued \"Remember the steam engine? Are you still liking the wheel and the pulley? Are you the wedge? You're the wedge!\"\n\nCramer also commented on the market moving higher during the day after the week's devastation. He mentioned a couple of non-tech sectors that had particularly done well. In his words:",

Shares of the House of Mouse have fallen 18% in the past three years, as the market has been worried -- mostly about the decline of cable TV and what were sizable streaming losses.\n\nBut there are better days on the horizon. After it climbed 33% since mid-August last year (as of Jan. 30), I predict that this top media and entertainment conglomerate will see its stock price soar in 2025 and beyond. My belief stems from improving streaming results.\n\nSetting the standard\n\nI think it's important to first take a step back and realize what direction Disney's finances could be heading in. Luckily, there's a clear-cut leader in the streaming industry to pay attention to: Netflix.\n\nWith 302 million subscribers, Netflix dominates the market. But what's notable is how its profitability has trended. The business reported a stellar 27% operating margin in 2024. That was up from 7% 10 years ago in 2024. Scaling up the revenue base, while keeping content, marketing, and technology costs under control, has been a winning recipe.\n\nDisney's advantage\n\nCan Disney follow what Netflix did? There are reasons to be optimistic.\n\nFor starters, the company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming segment has turned the corner financially. It has reported two straight quarters of positive operating income. Management expects the division to post a 10% operating margin in fiscal 2026 (excluding Hulu Live TV and ESPN streaming results). Looking at Netflix's profitability, Disney likely has much greater upside with this metric over time.\n\nGiven that DTC in total counts hundreds of millions of subscribers and generated $22.8 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue, it certainly has meaningful scale. The leadership team's focus on cost cuts and prioritizing quality over quantity with content spend is encouraging, too.\n\nDisney also has a major advantage, and that is the ability to bundle services. The traditional cable-TV industry is in secular decline, to be sure, but it's hard to deny that the bundling strategy provides tremendous value as we look to the future.\n\nDisney is best positioned to offer its own bundle in the streaming age with Disney+ (family entertainment), Hulu (general entertainment), and ESPN+ (sports). Indeed, management's pricing strategy reflects pushing customers in this direction, with the ad-supported trio bundle costing only $1 more per month than the stand-alone ad-free Disney+ option. The business has also added Hulu and ESPN tiles to the Disney+ service to facilitate a more unified experience.\n\nCustomers can tackle the entertainment needs for the entire household with one subscription. Disney gains by being able to maximize revenue, increase engagement, and reduce churn. That seems like a winning combination that no other competitor can match.\n\nAnd while Netflix is relatively new to the advertising game, Disney has built up expertise in this regard for a very long time. Having competency here creates the ability for better monetization of viewers and their attention.\n\nMaintain perspective\n\nTo be clear, I believe Disney is a compelling investment opportunity right now. The potential for DTC operating income to increase meaningfully is one key reason why.\n\nThe valuation is another convincing argument. Shares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.9. That's below the S&P 500's multiple. The slight discount for what is a world-class company is hard to pass up.\n\nWhile Disney has clear upside for investors, it's not a foregone conclusion that the stock price will soar in 2025. In order for this favorable outcome to become a reality, market sentiment must also improve dramatically. This is totally unpredictable, and it can change at any moment for whatever reason.\n\nAt the end of the day, investors must ask if they think Disney stock looks like a smart investment with a three- to five-year time horizon. In my opinion, it does. Hopefully its performance in 2025 will provide an early indication that my view is correct.",

            "content": "With my youngest child approaching his teenage years I thought my Disney days were over, but when my grandchildren came to me asking, \u201cZayda, can you come with us to Disney,\u201d I couldn\u2019t say no. So, I spent two days this week at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, and brought a baseball cap so that nobody would be able to tell that I am Jewish.\n\nAs we pulled into the park, I decided not to wear it. In a time when too many are trying to scare us, attempting to intimidate us into removing our symbols, hiding our practices or being ashamed of our identity, it is more important than ever to proudly wear our yarmulkas, show our tzitzis, or necklaces displaying Jewish stars, maps of Israel, or solidarity with hostages, and not cower from practices that are appropriate in public.\n\nA woman and her family came over to me at one of the parks to say how happy she was to see Jewish people not afraid to wear their yarmulka in public. When I asked if she was Jewish, she told me she was and that she went to a Jewish school in Minneapolis as a child. A man walking by stopped to say, \u201cShalom.\u201d I responded \u201cShalom\u201d and asked if he was Jewish. He told me he is a pastor from Alabama and that he and his congregation regularly pray for Israel and the Jewish people. His wife quickly added, \u201cand we have been praying constantly for the hostages.\u201d\n\nWe got a \u201cboker tov\u201d [good morning in Hebrew] from one of the Disney employees and a few more \u201cshaloms\u201d and, I\u2019m happy to report, no negativity or hostility. The truth is, I would expect nothing more at the \u201cHappiest Place on Earth.\u201d It is hard to think of another place where such a large quantity of people all seem so courteous, kind, pleasant, and polite.\n\nGenerally speaking, one doesn\u2019t find pushing or shoving, short tempers, a culture of criticism, or impolite and impatient people at Disney, despite having to wait on long lines, pay large fees, endure the hot sun, and spend hours on one\u2019s feet.\n\nAs we observed the throngs of people with smiles on their faces and extraordinary consideration towards one another, I couldn\u2019t help but think, wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if our shuls were like Disney? Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if people thought of our campuses and communities as the happiest places on Earth, places that even if they had to stand for long periods, sometimes wait on lines, endure imperfect temperatures, it would not only be well worth it, they would be clamoring and counting down to coming back.\n\nHow does Disney do it and what could we learn regarding creating a culture of happiness?\n\nHow to Create A Culture of Happiness\n\nMany years ago, I participated in a behind-the-scenes tour of Disney to explore that very question. The design and layouts of the parks, the placement of vendors, and the timing of the shows are all meticulously and brilliantly strategized and arranged. But what struck me most from the tour was the culture and how the attitude of the Disney\u2019s tens of thousands of workers impacts each and every one of their guests.\n\nDisney understands a fundamental psychological principle supported by extensive research \u2013 happiness and joy are contagious.\n\nIn every employee only area, there are signs highlighting the Disney credo, including: \u201cI project a positive image and energy. I am courteous and respectful to all guests including children. I go above and beyond.\u201d\n\nDisney understands a fundamental psychological principle supported by extensive research \u2013 happiness and joy are contagious. Just as if one person yawns others will follow suit, so too, if a person smiles, others around him will start smiling as well. A happy disposition, a positive spirit, and a pleasant countenance are quite literally contagious.\n\nWhose responsibility is it to spread the smiles? There are roughly 77,000 employees at Disney World in Orlando. All members of the staff, from custodial and maintenance, to the ride operators and people who wear the Mickey costumes, are all referred to as \u201ccast members.\u201d How many of the 77,000 cast members do you think are responsible for picking up the garbage? The answer is all 77,000. How many are responsible for helping someone with directions or return a lost child to their parents? 77,000. How many are required to smile and spread the happiness? That\u2019s right, all 77,000.\n\nAt Disney, the cast members know that they each have different tasks but they are taught that they all have the same purpose: spreading happiness.\n\nEvery Jew Is Responsible\n\nHow do we go from a culture of complaining and criticism to creating the happiest place on Earth?\n\nPerhaps we can create a culture in which every single Jew, every participant of the community is a member of the \u201ccast.\u201d We must go from consumers, from members with entitlements and privileges, to stakeholders, cast members who feel a sense of personal responsibility, duty and obligation.\n\nWe must go from consumers, from members with entitlements and privileges, to stakeholders, cast members who feel a sense of personal responsibility, duty and obligation.\n\nIf we want to be a place that attracts all, that inspires non-observant and disaffected Jews, that makes teens and youth excited about their Judaism, we ALL need to be leaders in making happiness, joy and meaning contagious in our institutions and homes.\n\nWhen speaking with a child, Disney cast members are trained to bend down and meet them at eye level. I saw firsthand the subtle but powerful impact of speaking to someone, even a child, at eye level instead of making them look up at you while feeling small. We need to speak to all the members and participants in our community at their eye level. Sometimes that will mean bending down, ensuring nobody feels small, no matter what their Jewish education or level of observance.\n\nIn complimenting and blessing Yehuda, Yaakov says, \u201cHis teeth are whiter than milk.\u201d Of all virtues, why is Yaakov highlighting Yehuda\u2019s teeth? The Talmud (Kesubos 111b) explains that Yaakov saw a quality in Yehuda he greatly admired and benefited from. Yehuda had a habit of smiling, of flashing the white of his teeth when seeing others. Indeed, the Talmud concludes when a person shows the white of his teeth to another by smiling widely, it is more beneficial than giving a cup of milk to drink. Why the comparison to milk?\n\nRav Shlomo Wolbe explains that milk nourishes and nurtures growth. What milk does for the body, a smile does for the heart and soul. He writes that just as plants require sunshine to live, converting the rays of the sun into nutrients, people convert smiles into energy and strength, and without it they wilt and perish. Dogs and cats can\u2019t smile. Smiling at one another is part of what differentiates us as humans.\n\nLet\u2019s all be active members of the Jewish people\u2019s cast and convert our shuls and communities into the happiest places on Earth.",

Known for its sing-along atmosphere and impressive performances, Jellyrolls quickly became a favorite among Disney fans and locals looking for entertainment outside the theme parks. Unlike many other venues at Walt Disney World, Jellyrolls has maintained an adults-only environment, making it a popular spot for those seeking a late-night escape with live music and signature drinks.

(Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nYou know Kenny Mayne is a genuine Wiffle Ball enthusiast when he reminds you how to spell out the brand, \u201cThat\u2019s W-I-F-F-L-E.\u201d\n\nGot it. We\u2019ll get the H outta here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to stand up for the Wiffle Ball people,\u201d Mayne says.\n\nMayne is the former ESPN broadcaster, contestant ever-so-briefly on \u201cDancing With The Stars\u201d and UNLV grad who is headlining at Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s Comedy Club at 7:30 p.m. Monday.\n\n\u201cWiffle Ball,\u201d Mayne\u2019s autobiographical documentary, is to be screened. The man whose memoir is titled \u201cAn Incomplete and Inaccurate History of Sport\u201d is a funny person. But he\u2019s not exactly a stand-up comic \u2014 yet.\n\n\u201cAfter I dreamed up this dumb idea, I tell my wife, and she\u2019s like, \u2018So, you\u2019re basically soft-rolling a comedy career. Is that what we\u2019re doing now?\u2019\u201d Mayne says. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing comedy in one way or the other for a long time, actually, just, we just didn\u2019t call it that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWiffle Ball\u201d is a reference a slice of lore from Mayne\u2019s days as a young broadcaster in Seattle. Mayne challenged then-rookie Mariners sensation Ken Griffey Jr. to a contest to see who could throw a Wiffle Ball the fastest.\n\n\u201cThey had a radar machine or a speed gun, whatever you call it, at the (Pacific) Science Center, and we threw for 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d Mayne reminisces. \u201cIt was just funny that it happened, \u2018Wow, I threw Wiffle Balls against Ken Griffey.\u2019 That\u2019s like saying I shot 3-pointers against Steph Curry.\u201d\n\nVideo from the event took some unearthing, and there is a dispute about who registered the fastest throw (Mayne, of course, claims he did). But what aired at the time were what Mayne says were \u201cquestions that were so bad I can\u2019t believe we showed them on TV.\u201d\n\n\u201cI finally found the tape and just said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna make a really stupid kind of comedy documentary about a day in the life, essentially, and sort of a love letter to my childhood and Wiffle Ball and my friends,\u201d\u2019 Mayne says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of everything.\u201d\n\nThat includes his time at UNLV, when Mayne was a backup QB to the great Sam King in 1980. There was a time he was ahead of Randall Cunningham on the Rebels\u2019 depth chart. Mayne was a senior, Cunningham a freshman.\n\nMayne\u2019s career with the Rebels was cut short when he suffered a fractured right fibula and torn ligaments in a 32-9 loss at Oregon in October 1980. Mayne later said he remembered little about the event, other than an assistant coach giving him a scotch and water on the flight home. As Mayne later conveyed in a piece for ESPN.com, \u201cHey, we\u2019re UNLV, that\u2019s how we roll.\u201d\n\nMayne has delved outside of his role as a prominent broadcaster, becoming a star at ESPN from 1994-2021. He and fellow sports personality Dan Patrick were cast in Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s 1998 satire \u201cBASEketball.\u201d The two announced the BASEketball playoffs.\n\nIn 2006, Mayne appeared in just the second season of \u201cDWTS,\u201d paired with dance pro Andrea Hale. The pair were the first contestants eliminated after a clunky cha-cha.\n\nMayne didn\u2019t feel qualified to be on the show, in terms of dance acumen or star power. But he took it anyway, as a lark.\n\n\u201cI get this call, \u2018Hey, they\u2019re asking if you want to be one of the people on \u2018Dancing With the Stars,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, well, who is the star?\u201d Mayne says. \u201cAm I dancing with Jessica Lange? They were basically trying to cast a wide net.\u201d\n\nDrew Lachey of 98 Degrees and Cheryl Burke won that season\u2019s championship. NFL legend Jerry Rice and Anna Trebunskaya finished second, and WWE wrestler Stacy Keibler and Tony Dovolani (who years later would later be stunt-cast for a guest role in Chippendales at the Rio) were third.\n\nMayne, Rice and the late, legendary judge Len Goodman turned Mayne\u2019s ill-fated performance into a long-running joke.\n\n\u201cWe ended up doing this little comedy bit for seven years or something, where we\u2019d come on every season and do a funny little three- to five-minute fake \u2018Sports Center,\u2019\u201d Mayne says. \u201cWe called it \u2018Dance Center,\u2019 and, you know, just clowned around. It was a great relationship.\u201d\n\nThat is totally on-brand. With Kenny Mayne, it always comes back to the funny.\n\nWe are excited about this\n\n\u2014 The inspired Nas with the Las Vegas Philharmonic returns to Encore Theater on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. This is a run of his groundbreaking debut album, \u201cIllmatic.\u201d Backed by members of the Philharmonic, the rap superstar unspools \u201cIf I Ruled the World\u201d and \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Hard to Tell,\u201d among many other highlights.\n\n\u2014 \u201cBlake Shelton Live in Las Vegas\u201d runs for six shows a the Colosseum at Caesars Palace from Wednesday through Feb. 15.

            "content": "As Walt Disney once predicted, Disneyland will \"never be completed.\" It will continue growing \"as long as there is imagination left in the world.\" Disney's original theme park in Anaheim, California, is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year, and there's a lot of new rides, experiences and shows on the horizon -- both at Disneyland and at its 53-year-old counterpart in Florida, Walt Disney World.\n\nFrom new rides and new lands to huge park expansions, here's everything new coming to Disney Parks and the Disney Cruise Line in 2025 and beyond.\n\nDisneyland's 70th anniversary\n\nConcept art of how Sleeping Beauty Castle will look at Disneyland during the 70th celebration. Artist Concept/Disneyland Resort\n\nKicking off in mid-May is Disneyland's 70th birthday celebration. The original Disney park opened on July 17, 1955, but the birthday celebration begins two months early, on May 16, and continues for more than a year, running through summer 2026.\n\n\"Celebrate happy\" is the theme, and new events will include a Mickey and Friends cavalcade (including Duffy and ShellieMay); a projection show at It's a Small World called \"Tapestry of Happiness\" (as well as Miguel and Dante being added to the ride!) and a projection show at Carthay Circle; new outfits for Mickey and friends; and the World of Color Happiness show. The new World of Color show will be hosted by Joy from Inside Out, with the other Emotions manifesting movie moments from Pixar and Disney films including The Incredibles, Turning Red, A Goofy Movie, Encanto and Tangled.\n\nThe esplanade between Disneyland and California Adventure will be getting a 50-foot sculpture of Sleeping Beauty Castle, with more decorations sprinkled throughout Downtown Disney and Main Street USA, as well as inside Disney's hotels. There will even be 70th anniversary decor included in the Toy Story Midway Mania ride.\n\nConcept art of the 70th anniversary decor in Toy Story Midway Mania. Artist Concept/Disneyland Resort\n\nThe Paint the Night parade, Pixar Pals parade and Wondrous Journeys fireworks show will also be returning for the celebration.\n\nOn the official anniversary day of July 17, Disneyland will debut a new verse for It's A Small World, as well as a three-minute film called The Last Verse in the Main Street Cinema. The movie celebrates the Sherman Brothers, who wrote the music for the ride. There will also be a new gallery exhibition in the Opera House on Main Street USA, featuring never-before-seen images, art and artifacts from the development, opening and evolution of Disneyland. These include the original rocking chair, lamp and table from Walt Disney's private apartment above the Fire Station on Main Street; Walt's 1955 Emmy award; and his Presidential Medal of Freedom from 1964. There will be a second exhibit on the history of animatronics.\n\nThe first ever audio-animatronic figure of Walt Disney himself, as part of the Walt Disney: A Magical Life show inside the Main Street Opera House, will also debut on July 17.\n\nHow much are Disneyland tickets for the 70th celebration?\n\nAnother big drawcard for the 70th anniversary celebrations: ticket pricing.\n\nIf you're visiting Disneyland between May 16 and Aug. 14, 2025, you can buy tickets that are part of the Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer. These will cost $360 for a three-day, one-park-per-day ticket, or $400 for a four-day, one-park-per-day ticket.\n\nAvengers Campus is getting two more rides\n\nThe Avengers Infinity Defense ride Disney\n\nDisney's California Adventure, already home to the Spider-Man Web Slingers and Guardians of the Galaxy attractions in the Avengers Campus area of the park, will be getting two more Marvel attractions.\n\nDuring SXSW over the weekend, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, Imagineering chief creative officer Bruce Vaughn and Iron Man himself, Robert Downey Jr., revealed more details about these two new rides. Avengers Infinity Defense will see you assemble alongside the Avengers battling King Thanos, featuring appearances by Black Panther, Ant-Man and Hulk. Stark Flight Lab, the second ride, will see you help test Tony Stark's latest tech.\n\n\"In Stark Flight Lab, guests will sit in 'gyro-kinetic pods' and roll along a track before stopping in front of a giant robot arm,\" Disney explains on its Parks Blog. \"This robot arm will hoist you into the air where you'll make several high-speed maneuvers inspired by Iron Man and some other Avengers.\"\n\nConstruction begins this year on the Avengers Campus additions.\n\nA first look at the Pixar Cars rally race\n\nThe new Cars rally race ride. Disney\n\nThe Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island at Disney World's Magic Kingdom are being repurposed to add an area themed around Pixar's Cars movies. This expansion of Frontierland, which currently encompasses Tiana's Bayou Adventure and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, will get a Route 66 companion.\n\n\"To make way for this completely new frontier, the Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island will be transformed into vast and rugged terrains for a rally race with some of the world's most iconic racers,\" Disney said in a blog post last year.\n\nSXSW this past weekend also saw Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter and Imagineer Michel Hundgen talk about the new ride vehicle being invested for the Cars ride. You can watch a TikTok video of Disney Imagineers testing out off-road vehicles in the desert in Arizona in an effort to create what the ride will feel like.\n\n\"These are all things Lightning McQueen and Mater haven't experienced before, like racing over rocky terrain, ascending to mountain peaks, and dodging around geysers \u2014 how do you take these real-world elements and put a Cars spin on it?\" Disney Parks says in a blog post. Docter added that each rally car will have its own personality, name and racing number.\n\nDisney last year said there will be a second Cars-themed attraction, too. Cars Land, which was added to Disney's California Adventure back in 2012, remains popular in the west, so it was only a matter of time before it was added to the east. Work is set to begin this year, though there's no closing date yet for Tom Sawyer Island or the Liberty Square Riverboat.\n\nMonsters Inc. land and ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios\n\nDisney's first suspended roller coaster will take you on a ride through the Monsters Inc. factory. Disney/Pixar\n\nAnother new addition coming to Disney World at its Hollywood Studios theme park is a Monsters Inc.-themed area, to replace the current Muppets area (with the Muppets to replace Aerosmith theming in the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster).\n\nRevealed by the voice of Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), the land will let you stroll through Monstropolis from the Pixar movies and shorts. A new ride will also take you through the Monsters Inc. laugh factory aboard one of the doors to the human world \u2014 aka a suspended roller coaster.\n\n\"The first time I saw Monsters, Inc., all I wanted to do was ride on one of those doors like Mike and Sulley,\" D'Amaro said at D23 in August. \"You'll go into the factory and experience the first suspended coaster ever in a Disney park. Remember in the movie how those claws grab the doors and hoist them up into the air to take them away? We're doing that, too. And you're going along for the ride.\"\n\nDocter and Hundgen were also on-hand to talk about the new Monsters Inc. ride during SXSW, which \"will feature the first-ever suspended coaster at a Disney Park, and the first-ever vertical lift.\" The loading area will see you board the ride vehicle and then \"hoisted into the air.\" Here's the TikTok showing the design concept for the Monsters Inc. ride.\n\nYour last day to enjoy MuppetVision 3D is June 7. It'll close permanently on June 8. Work on the Monsters Inc. land will then begin later in 2025. There's no closing date yet for the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster.\n\nCalifornia Adventure is getting a Coco attraction\n\nConcept art for the new Coco ride. Disney/Pixar\n\nDisney's California Adventure is also getting more Pixar rides.\n\nA Coco attraction will be built in a yet-to-be-announced area of the park, but it sounds like it'll be a dark ride like Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, populated by Audio-Animatronics.\n\n\"The attraction will be filled with the characters \u2014 and music! \u2014 you know and love from the beloved movie, as you join Miguel on a trip to the land of the dead,\" Disney says.\n\nWork begins on the Coco ride in 2026, so its launch is still a while away.\n\nBluey says hello at Disneyland and Disney World\n\nMeet and greets with Bluey and her family will be coming to Disneyland and Disney World, as well as to Disney cruises, starting at an unspecified time in 2025. Disney announced this news after revealing that a Bluey movie will be hitting screens in 2027.\n\n\"Bluey has become a household name for families around the world, and we are thrilled to bring her story to life in new ways,\" said Disney Experiences Chair Josh D'Amaro. \"We can't wait to watch our youngest guests and their families make memories with Bluey in our parks and on our cruises.\"\n\nThe hugely popular Australian TV series about a family of dogs is a worldwide hit, with Disney to release the movie in two years' time. (In the meantime, you can watch Bluey episodes and minisodes on Disney Plus.)\n\nAn Avatar area is coming to Disneyland\n\nAn aerial shot of the Avatar-themed area coming to Disneyland Resort. Disney\n\nThe world of Pandora is expanding from Disney World's Animal Kingdom in Orlando to California Adventure in Anaheim. The area in California will take its design inspiration from the second Avatar film, The Way of Water, as well as the upcoming Avatar sequels.\n\nIt'll likely be part of the enormous Disneyland expansion coming to the theme parks that will push the boundaries past Downtown Disney and into the nearby parking lots. While Disney was short on details and dates, the Avatar experience will be \"dynamic, intense and emotional,\" with a dark boat ride much like Pirates of the Caribbean \"taking guests all the way to the wide-open seas of Pandora.\"\n\nDisney World's Magic Kingdom Villains Land\n\nDisney World's Magic Kingdom is getting a Villains Land. Disney\n\nVillains Land, which will celebrate all the classic baddies from Disney films, is coming to the Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, and it will be \"dark and thorny,\" according to the Horizons Disney Experiences Showcase (part of Disney's D23 expo in August) and info that Disney has released since.\n\nVillains Land was first teased during D23 2022. It'll be positioned on the other side of Big Thunder Mountain \u2014 aka, the top left edge of the current Magic Kingdom map \u2014 and will stretch around to where the Haunted Mansion is.\n\nTwo major attractions will be built in Villains Land, as well as dining and shopping \"on an incredibly twisted grand scale.\" The land is already being constructed, but no word yet on when it'll open.\n\nA chilling trailer for the chaotic land on Instagram hints at elements in the land representing Maleficent, Dr. Facilier, Ursula, Gaston, Yzma, Queen of Hearts, Hades, the Evil Queen, Lady Tremaine, Captain Hook, Jafar, Kaa, Madam Mim, Cruella, Scar, King Magnifico and Mother Gothel.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this: Disney Parks Announcements at D23 03:24\n\nTropical Americas land at Animal Kingdom\n\nDisney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World is replacing its DinoLand USA area with Tropical Americas.

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Walt Disney is US$123 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\nWith US$113 share price, Walt Disney appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n\nThe US$125 analyst price target for DIS is 1.4% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Walt Disney\n\nIs Walt Disney Fairly Valued?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.42b US$8.62b US$9.62b US$11.9b US$12.9b US$13.7b US$14.3b US$14.9b US$15.5b US$16.0b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x11 Analyst x11 Analyst x7 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 5.86% Est @ 4.89% Est @ 4.21% Est @ 3.73% Est @ 3.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$6.9k US$7.4k US$7.6k US$8.8k US$8.8k US$8.6k US$8.4k US$8.1k US$7.8k US$7.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$80b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the surge in cruise stocks, offering a perspective that diverges from the usual focus on the tech sector. According to Cramer, the excitement over DeepSeek's impact on technology has caused many to overlook simpler, more accessible opportunities. While questions about power plants, data centers, and the future of companies like Nvidia are complex, Cramer finds comfort in identifying opportunities that are easier to grasp. One such opportunity, he pointed out, is with the cruise line operators.\n\nCramer cited a comment from the CEO of a cruise operator who mentioned that the current macro environment favors experiences over material goods as spending on leisure and travel continues to rise and said:\n\n\u201cHey, to me it means the cruise lines were cyclical stories before Covid, but now they've become genuine secular growth plays and they may stay that way for a generation.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that many investors are still struggling to accept the rapid growth of cruises in such a short time span, despite travel being a massive $2 trillion industry. Cruises, within that context, offer significant value, Cramer noted.\n\nREAD ALSO 7 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar and Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch\n\nHe also highlighted an important factor that has changed the cruise industry since the pandemic: many cruise companies have become far more disciplined in managing their capacity. Unlike before, when too many ships would flood the market, operators are now taking a more cautious approach, which has made the industry more resilient. This shift, according to Cramer, has strengthened the position of cruise lines moving forward. Despite this, he observed that travel and leisure stocks remain undervalued, as many analysts continue to doubt the staying power of the cruise industry.\n\nWhile Cramer acknowledged that there are still underperforming companies in the market, including a struggling airline stock he pointed out, he firmly stated that he would prefer to own shares in the worst cruise line over the best airline.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 28.

            "content": "The Walt Disney Co. has long positioned itself as a leader in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), with a strong emphasis on representation in its storytelling and hiring initiatives. However, amid increasing political and social scrutiny, Disney\u2019s stance on DEI has become more nuanced. While the company has not made any official statements about its current DEI direction, publicly available information suggests both continued commitment and strategic scaling back in certain areas.\n\nDisney\u2019s Public Commitments And Ongoing Initiatives\n\nDisney has historically been a vocal advocate for diversity, integrating themes of inclusion across its programming and corporate policies. The company remains a supporter of diverse gender and sexual identities in its content, as highlighted in recent branded content initiatives with EqualPride. Additionally, its official website continues to prominently feature its DEI commitments, signaling an ongoing prioritization of these values.\n\nAccording to Disney\u2019s Sustainability and Social Impact Report, \u201cWe are committed to attracting, retaining, and developing a workforce that reflects the world\u2019s rich diversity of experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives. This is important to our business and our mission of entertaining and inspiring families from all walks of life.\u201d\n\nThat Park Place noted a recent SEC filing further reinforces Disney\u2019s commitment to DEI with it impacting board selection and executive bonuses. The filing also specifically lists diversity as a key corporate skill. This suggests that, at least at an institutional level, Disney still views DEI as a fundamental component of its long-term strategy.\n\nIs There Writing On The Wall?\n\nDespite these commitments, Disney appears to be making strategic adjustments in response to external pressures. According to Forbes, the company has discreetly pulled back certain DEI initiatives following intense scrutiny from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. One notable shift is the \u201cre-evaluating\u201d of its support for a United Negro College Fund (UNCF) program, which has historically played a role in Disney\u2019s diverse hiring initiatives. This subtle change, as identified in a Forbes caption for a Disney photo, suggests a recalibration of its approach to DEI-related partnerships.\n\nAnother indicator of this shift, highlighted by CNN, is Disney\u2019s recent decision to remove a transgender storyline from its animated series \u201cWin or Lose.\u201d While the company has not publicly framed this move as a retreat from DEI, the decision aligns with broader trends of entertainment companies reconsidering how they engage with politically sensitive topics.\n\nHow Is Disney Navigating The Political And Social Landscape?\n\nDisney\u2019s positioning in the DEI space has drawn criticism from multiple angles. On one hand, the company has been accused of being \u201cwoke\u201d due to its inclusive programming choices, which have sparked backlash from conservative voices. On the other, some advocates could argue that the company\u2019s supposed response to political pressure \u2014 especially in light of recent funding shifts \u2014 indicates a softening of its commitment.\n\nThis balancing act underscores the broader challenges that corporations face in today\u2019s polarized landscape. Disney\u2019s official DEI website still showcases its commitment to fostering inclusion, yet alleged subtle shifts in policy and programming hint at a more cautious approach moving forward.\n\nSince Disney has not made a public statement clarifying its stance, it remains difficult to definitively determine whether its DEI initiatives are a steadfast priority or a strategic recalibration in response to external pressures. This ambiguity reflects the broader uncertainty surrounding corporate DEI commitments in an era of heightened scrutiny and shifting public expectations.",

Since I can remember, Armah has instilled in me a love for history, oldies music, and most of all, musical theatre.\n\nAlmost every summer break, my family would trek up north to go visit her and my grandfather. These trips consisted of showing them whatever the newest Disney movies we had acquired on DVD and car rides down the backshore with Broadway show tunes playing in the background. Going to Disney World without her \u2014 seeing so many things we had bonded over throughout the years in front of me without her by my side to experience them \u2014 always felt like a double-edged sword. I was happy to be around so many things that reminded me of her, but I wanted to experience them with her.\n\nMy Armah is not the biggest fan of traveling, especially planes. I couldn\u2019t tell you how many times we have begged her to come down to Orlando. Armah always puts in such a big effort to come visit her family, but since the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been increasingly difficult. This past year was rough, to say the least. I experienced loss and dealt with grief, feelings I\u2019ve never really had to process before.\n\nMy grandmother, being the selfless person she is, made a decision: she felt as if this was the right time to push past her anxieties and be with her loved ones during the Christmas season. Saying I was ecstatic would be an understatement. My mind almost immediately went to the idea, \u201cCould this be the trip we finally get to go to Disney together for the first time?\u201d\n\nMy grandmother and I, many many years ago.\n\nTaking a grandparent to a theme park is not an easy task, but it was one I was more than up for. Obviously, I was not taking my Armah on Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind or subjecting her to the heat of Toy Story Land. The idea was to do an early morning at Magic Kingdom and lunch at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios.\n\nStrolling down Sunset Boulevard had always been melancholy for me. Sunset\u2019s music loop always reminded me of her, especially her favorite, \u201cBegin the Beguine,\u201d which always plays two songs after my favorite, \u201cIt\u2019s Been A Long, Long TIme,\u201d which is already a song that without fail stops me dead in my tracks. This loop is replaced with Christmas music during the holiday season, so unfortunately we wouldn\u2019t be able to hear the tunes I\u2019d wanted to experience together in my favorite area of the park. Still, I was going to make the very most of what would most likely be a short day due to my grandmother\u2019s energy levels.\n\nIn 2009, Armah and I went to the movie theater to see the new Pixar movie, \u201cUp.\u201d God, I\u2019m sincerely getting choked up just writing this. The future Academy Award nominee for BEST PICTURE had resonated so closely with us. To this day, my grandmother still claims it\u2019s her favorite movie we\u2019ve seen together. A few days before our trip to the park, I gifted her a pin of the iconic house from the movie to commemorate how truly special it was to me that we were going to Walt Disney World. Together. For the first time in my conscious memory. I\u2019m told she was there on my very first trip to Disney, but I, of course, do not remember this on account of being one year old.\n\nEvery time a Walt Disney World ad is on TV or online, I tear up. The place is just down the street, yet seeing a family experience the parks for the first time, albeit scripted in the commercial, tugs my heartstrings without fail. I was going to have that same day, unscripted.",

I\u2019m dressed in running gear, lacing up my Hokas, and rethinking everything as I head out of the lobby of the Disney Beach Club Resort. For starters: Why am I awake? And what did I sign myself up for?\n\nWhat I signed up for, in fact, is the runDisney 10K at Walt Disney World \u2014 one of four races that comprise Marathon Weekend at the world\u2019s happiest place. When I was invited to participate in one of those races, as well as experience the other fitness and self-care offerings available at the resort during January, I was all in. The promise of a fun-filled family vacation plus some built-in me time? Sign me up, indeed. Related story BODi Just Launched a New Subscription Bundle to Help Fast-track Your Fitness Goals \u2014 Here's How to Save Up to 60%\n\nAnd so it is that I\u2019m standing in the dark, with temperatures hovering around 40 degrees, queued in line for a bus that will take me to the start of the race while my husband and two kids are still cozy in their beds back in our hotel room. At the corral, the energy is electric. It\u2019s far and away the biggest crowd of runners I\u2019ve ever been in, and any hint of fatigue has evaporated by the 5:00 a.m. start time. (The early hour, by the way, is because the race winds through Epcot and needs to be over before the park opens.) Still, pitch dark and cold, it feels like we\u2019re running in the middle of the night, which is kind of a thrill in and of itself.\n\nI\u2019m a racing novice, and this is my first 10K. It turns out that that\u2019s a good thing. RunDisney\u2019s Marathon Weekend is a great place to kick off a new-to-you distance because, as I\u2019ve come to understand, runDisney races are not necessarily ones where people push for a PR. They\u2019re designed to be more fun than fast. People dress in costumes, there\u2019s music and live entertainment along the way, and there are built-in breaks for photo ops with Disney characters. (Full disclosure: I was not in peak form for this race, so I welcomed the breathers I got waiting in line to snap pics with Goofy and Princess Aurora.)\n\nWhile the race started in the Epcot parking lot and on the road outside of the park, the fun really started once we were winding our way through the back of Epcot, through the resort (where employees from the different country pavilions cheered us on), and along the BoardWalk. Running past the glowing, lit-up globe of Spaceship Earth was breathtaking (literally and figuratively, as I was huffing and puffing my way past it!). And seeing the park in a way that few people do \u2014 nearly empty save for runners and volunteers \u2014 was super cool.\n\nWhen I crossed the finish line and grabbed my Chip and Dale-decorated finishers medal, my immediate thought was, I want to do this again. I\u2019m hardly the only one who feels that way: there\u2019s an entire category of people who do what\u2019s known as the Dopey Challenge \u2014 running all four race distances (5K, 10K, Half Marathon, and Marathon) in the same weekend. (That\u2019s a whopping 48.6 miles if you\u2019re counting!) Plus, it would have been even more fun if my family had been running with me.\n\nAs it was, they were still asleep by the time I got back to my hotel, making it the perfect way to do something for myself on a family vacation. Later that morning, while they played at the hotel pool, I headed over to Disney Springs to enjoy some of the other Wellness Month activities, including a free yoga class hosted by lululemon and a relaxing mini-facial at L\u2019Occitane. (Other offerings have included Cirque du Soleil-led fitness classes and family Zumba.)\n\nAnd then it was back to Epcot, but this time as a foursome and with an entirely different perspective of the park. I was still in my Hokas, but it wasn\u2019t about running this time. It was about family bonding \u2014 and going on the rides.",

She also co-founded PULSE, a Business Employee Resource Group (BERG) centering the experiences of Black Cast Members and employees. Upon her retirement in 2022, Blanding became the first Black woman to achieve a half-century-long career with The Walt Disney Company and was named a Disney Legend in 2024.\n\nDuring her acceptance speech at the Disney Legend Awards Ceremony this past August, Martha shared a story about meeting with a high school counselor about her future. Her counselor basically had no faith in her because of who she is and said that she would be better off working with her hands. This visibly upset Martha who went home crying to her mother. As she told this story, you could hear sighs of disbelief among the crowd gathered in the Honda Center.\n\nHowever, Martha didn\u2019t let those negative comments stand in her way and made a future for herself working at Disneyland where she broke many barriers in the Company. The crowd applauded and cheered Martha for her contributions to Disneyland and the Walt Disney Company. Martha shared with her twin sister Mary in attendance, who asked her \u201cAre we Legends now\u201d when Martha told her about becoming a Disney Legend. Martha replied, \u201cI\u2019m just an ordinary Black girl from South Central Los Angeles who\u2019s had an amazing job at The Walt Disney Company. And I would do it all over again.\u201d Then she told her sister, \u201cHey Mary! We\u2019re now Disney Legends!\u201d\n\nAlso at the event will be Tim O\u2019Day. Tim O\u2019Day is an award-winning public relations executive, best-selling author, ideation consultant, and event producer. His creative spark was behind creating an Olympic-sized lap pool down Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland for U.S. Olympian swimmers, procuring a Disneyland star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, placing Dumbo the Flying Elephant in the Smithsonian, and retiring the pardoned White House Thanksgiving turkeys to the Disney Parks (among the most successful PR activations in Disney history), in addition to helping establish D23: The Official Disney Fan Club. He also helped secure the National Medal of Arts from President George W. Bush for the legendary Sherman brothers. His career has included work and projects with the Griffin Museum of Science+Industry in Chicago, Pasadena Tournament of Roses, Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences, PIER 39 of San Francisco, and others. He is currently seen on the popular Disney+ series Behind the Attraction, produced by Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.\n\nTickets for Groundbreaking Magic with Disney Legend Martha Blanding and Author Tim O\u2019Day are available now as follows:\n\nWalt\u2019s Circle Donors : Purchase tickets beginning Tuesday, January 28 at noon PT by emailing membership@wdfmuseum.org.\n\n: Purchase tickets beginning by emailing membership@wdfmuseum.org.

            "content": "Forum Forums\n\nPosted:\n\nAccording to The Wrap, multiple sources, including one close to the company, report that the former Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser building near Disney's Hollywood Studios is being converted into office space for Walt Disney Imagineering. The facility, once home to Disney's most ambitious themed entertainment experience, will now serve as a base for the creative division behind theme park attractions, retail locations, and cruise ships.\n\n\n\nThis report follows comments made by Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products Chairman Josh D'Amaro in a 2023 interview with The Points Guy. When asked about the future of the Galactic Starcruiser building, D'Amaro said, \"No hints yet, but something will happen.\" He acknowledged that while the project pushed creativity and storytelling to new heights, \"It didn't work commercially. And so, when we realized that, you just make a call and move on.\" It appeared at that point that D'Amaro was suggesting a guest-facing use of the building, but that plan appears to have now changed.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\n\nThe Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser opened on March 1, 2022, as a two-day, two-night immersive experience priced at approximately $5,200 per voyage. The experience initially saw strong sales, but bookings quickly slowed, prompting Disney to adjust operations to cut costs and boost occupancy. In May 2023, Disney announced the closure of the hotel, with the final voyage taking place from September 28-30, 2023.\n\nAs soon as Disney resumed bookings for the final trips, demand surged, and the remaining voyages sold out within hours. At the time, Disney assured booked guests that the company would work to accommodate those affected by canceled reservations. Cast Members working at the Starcruiser were also given the opportunity to transition to new roles at Walt Disney World.\n\n\n\nWDI Expands as Disney Begins Major New Projects\n\nThe move to convert the Galactic Starcruiser into Imagineering office space comes as Walt Disney World is preparing to launch several major projects, including:\n\nA Monsters, Inc. -themed expansion at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\n-themed expansion at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios A Cars -themed area replacing Tom Sawyer Island at Magic Kingdom\n\n-themed area replacing Tom Sawyer Island at Magic Kingdom The Tropical Americas expansion at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, replacing DinoLand U.S.A.\n\nWith these large-scale projects on the horizon, Imagineering\u2019s presence in Central Florida is expanding. WDI currently operates offices inside EPCOT and at the former STOLport (Short Takeoff and Landing Airport) site near Magic Kingdom.\n\nA Shift in Purpose\n\nWith the building now expected to become Imagineering office space, it appears Disney has no immediate plans to repurpose the facility for another guest experience.\n\nDisney has not officially confirmed The Wrap's report, but the decision to convert the Starcruiser building into office space suggests that any hopes of a new guest-facing experience in the facility, which included day excursions from Batuu, have been put to rest\u2014at least for now.",

            "content": "Those looking for a return to the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d-themed hotel and experience that Disney opened on March 1, 2022 and closed the following September, will probably have to put that dream aside. As of now there are no signs that you\u2019ll be able to return to a galaxy far, far away. (We have been told that the Starcruiser cost upwards of $1 billion; Disney asserts that the number is much, much lower.)\n\nAccording to several sources, including an individual close to the company, the building that formerly housed the immersive adventure (located near Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World) is being converted into offices for Walt Disney Imagineering, the secretive arm of the company responsible for theme park attractions, retail locations and cruise ships.\n\nWDI will be using the building as a hub for several expansion projects coming to the expansive Walt Disney World resort including (among other things) the Latin America area of Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom that will be home to \u201cEncanto\u201d and Indiana Jones-themed attractions; the upcoming \u201cCars\u201d- and Disney Villains-themed lands opening at the Magic Kingdom; and the \u201cMonsters, Inc.\u201d land, complete with door chase coaster, arriving at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios. (That \u201cMonsters, Inc.\u201d coaster is perhaps the most controversial, because it calls for the removal of Jim Henson\u2019s beloved final project \u2013 Muppet*Vision 3D.)\n\nTheWrap had heard rumblings that the building was going to be potentially utilized for a several-hour-long dinner theater-type experience that would use the hotel\u2019s lobby (used for key storytelling moments as part of the Galactic Starcruiser), bridge, bar and restaurant and that the gift shop would also remain open. But TheWrap has now been told, quite firmly, that the building will not be accessible to guests at all.\n\nThis likely has to do with how cumbersome it would be to shuttle guests to the Starcruiser building, which is in a backstage area of the park. When the hotel was open, themed shuttles would transport guests to and from Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios on the experience\u2019s \u201caway day\u201d \u2013 where guests would have exclusive interactions in Disney\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d-themed land Galaxy\u2019s Edge. Those shuttles could only carry a few guests at a time, which isn\u2019t ideal if you\u2019re trying to repurpose the space for a more inclusive dining experience.\n\nAccording to one source, several playtests have been conducted in that part of the old Starcruiser building, with cast members filling in for paying guests. But the tests would be for a potential dining experience in the theme park, not in the Starcruiser building itself.\n\nWhen Oga\u2019s Cantina, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d-themed bar in Galaxy\u2019s Edge, was first conceived, it was initially part of a larger, dinner theater experience. This experience was teased in early concept art and seemingly repurposed when many of these experiences, meant for regular park guests, were shifted over to the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser project. Now, they\u2019re circling back to that dinner theater idea.\n\nWhile the Starcruiser experience only lasted a little more than a year, it has been memorialized by those who actually did it and by those who watched video essayist (and Disney theme park superfan) Jenny Nicholson\u2019s four-hour takedown of the enterprise, which has a whopping 11 million views on YouTube.\n\nSome were hopeful that the experience would reopen as something (perhaps with an overlay attached to whatever \u201cStar Wars\u201d project was currently being promoted by the company), but the conversion to office space seems to close the book on the project for the foreseeable future.\n\nDisney took a tax writedown on the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, which would freeze the use of that building for a specific period of time. And most of the projects outlined above are just starting, so it could be years before they actually open.",

Walt Disney World\u2019s \u201cStar Wars hotel\u201d as it was often referred to, was a multi-day experience that attempted to make guests feel like they were part of the galaxy, far, far away to a degree never even attempted before. It was an incredible leap forward in themed entertainment\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes when you swing, you miss, and that was the case with the Galactic Starcruiser. The attraction's high price point likely narrowed the audience to the point that it became unsustainable. The Galactic Starcruiser closed a year and a half ago, but with any theme park closure, there\u2019s an excitement for what could happen next. Get ready for disappointment, because what\u2019s coming won\u2019t be that impressive to most guests\n\nGalactic Starcruiser Is Becoming Offices For Walt Disney Imagineering.\n\nAccording to a new story from The Wrap, the Galactic Starcruiser won\u2019t be transformed into an expansion for Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge, or any other guest-facing operation. Instead, the plan is to make the building offices for Walt Disney Imagineering, the arm of the Walt Disney Company tasked with creating its theme park experiences.\n\nNeedless to say, this is something of a bummer. There were a lot of hopes that since Starcruiser had been something available to guests before, whatever replaced it would as well. Perhaps a new attraction could be added. Maybe the dining experience that was a key part of the Galactic Starcruiser would become something that any Disney World guest could make a reservation for.\n\nWalt Disney World Has A Lot Of New Projects To Work On\n\nHaving said that, it must be admitted that there\u2019s good reason to find a place that Walt Disney Imagineering can work from that is close to the action of Walt Disney World. There\u2019s a lot going on in the parks over the next several years.\n\nWhile Disney World doesn\u2019t have any major new attractions this year, the combined total of what\u2019s coming to Disney World in 2025 is extensive. Beyond that, there are three new theme park lands currently in development, a Tropical Americas land coming to Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, a Monsters Inc. land coming to Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios, and a Villains land set to be built at Disney World\u2019s flagship Magic Kingdom. There\u2019s also a massive redesign of Fronterland on the way.\n\nAt one point Disney was considering relocating nearly all of Imagineering to Florida, and while that plan was scuttled, there are still plenty of Imagineers in Florida who need a place to work, and now more than ever, having that place beat the heart of the action is not a bad call.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMaybe down the road, once a lot of the planned work is done, Imagineering won\u2019t need the offices anymore. If and when that happens the Galactic Starcruiser space could still become something for guests to enjoy, but it seems clear that if that day does come it\u2019s still several years away.",

Disney VoluntEARS are working to collect essential items and make them available to families and individuals impacted by the wildfires with the help of community organizations, including Shelter Partnership, Helping Hands, and LAUSD.\n\n\u201cSince the moment this disaster hit, our employees have been asking what they can do to help,\u201d said Lisa Haines, senior vice president, Corporate Social Responsibility, The Walt Disney Company. \u201cThe Disney VoluntEARS team quickly mobilized to put on one of the largest disaster relief drives our company has done, collecting more than 200,000 items from employees and Cast Members across the company. This outpouring of support is just one of the many ways we are coming together to help those who have lost so much.\u201d\n\nHere are a few of the donation drives throughout the region where cast members and employees have donated items and volunteered their time in support of the Los Angeles community.\n\nDonation Drive at The Walt Disney Studios Lot\n\nDisney hosted a Los Angeles Area Fire Relief Donation Drive at The Walt Disney Studios Lot in Burbank and packaged over 27,000 essential items for those affected. Nearly 1,000 cast members and employees from across Southern California donated new items and volunteered to count, sort, and pack items such as hygiene essentials, baby supplies, games and toys. The teams at Fox, Hulu, and ABC satellite offices also collected items to contribute to the larger drive.\n\n\u201cDisney\u2019s magic is in our people, and seeing the Disney VoluntEARS in action pulls at my heartstrings. I love that we\u2019re providing a little bit of comfort and happiness to families who have been impacted by the fires,\u201d said Kym Belzer, senior manager, Corporate Social Responsibility, The Walt Disney Company. \u201cEvents like this give an outlet for employees to be a part of something, especially rebuilding the lives of the families who have been impacted by the fires.\u201d\n\nLeading by example, executives and their teams came to help alongside hundreds of Disney VoluntEARS.\n\nFrom left to right: Rachel Hutter, EVP, Operations, Disney Entertainment, Studios with her team; Lisa Haines, SVP, Corporate Social Responsibility with Sonia Coleman, Chief Human Resources Officer\n\nFrom left to right: Josh D\u2019Amaro, Chairman, Disney Experiences; Lylle Breier, EVP, Partnerships, Promotions, Synergy & Events, Disney Entertainment Studios Marketing with Potrock, President, Major Events Integration, The Walt Disney Company.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live Donation Center\n\norganized the \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live Donation Center\u201d on its Hollywood backlot to collect essential resources for those impacted by the LA fires. Staff, friends, and fans came together to collect nearly 70,000 much-needed items during the week-long drive.\n\n\u201c[The wildfires have] been a sickening, shocking, awful experience. But it has also been, in a lot of ways, a beautiful experience. Because once again, we see our fellow men and women coming together to support each other,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel said in his monologue following the start of the fires.\n\nThe Kimmel team brought the donations to a pop-up distribution center for those with immediate needs in Altadena. At the end of the week, two five-ton trucks of donations were delivered to a soundstage at Disney\u2019s Burbank Studio lot, where Disney VoluntEARS counted and sorted the items at the donation drive event for additional distribution.\n\nDisneyland Resort Donation Drive\n\nIn the Disneyland Resort spirit, more than 60 Anaheim-based Disney VoluntEARS, including Disney Ambassador of Disneyland Resort Raul Aquino Rojas, collected and sorted essential items donated by hundreds of Disneyland Resort cast members to support those impacted in the local community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud to see our Disneyland Resort cast members come together to provide relief for the communities affected by the fires,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cEvery contribution, no matter how small, helps rebuild lives \u2014 reminding us all that together, we can overcome anything.\u201d\n\nThe event also brought teams together, as some Disneyland Resort cast members were personally impacted by the fires. One cast member, Jennifer Santillan, manager, Guest Talent & Imagination Campus, was able to reunite at the event with a fellow cast member who lost her home.\n\n\u201cYou want to always think of a way to help, a way to think outside the box and help those that are in need, and the best way is to take action. Today, I get to take action in helping those that will need these items, need some joy and need one less thing to worry about,\u201d Santillan said.\n\nBy the end of the event, Disneyland Resort had collected more than 50,000 essential items and supplies to contribute to wildfire relief efforts.\n\nVolunteering is an important and enduring part of Disney\u2019s DNA, and Disney VoluntEARS have collectively contributed more than 13 million hours of service to their communities since the program\u2019s inception in 1983.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into The Walt Disney Co's (NYSE:DIS) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-29, The Walt Disney Co's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $58.08. It's currently trading at a price of $112.14. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -93.08%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nBeyond Market Price: Uncovering The Walt Disney Co's Intrinsic Value\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. The Walt Disney Co's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $5.03 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.53%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = -4.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 23.9 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 7.79 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 58.08\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $54.08. This valuation indicates that the The Walt Disney Co is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -107.36%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Amidst The DeepSeek AI Selloff. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn the episode of CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on the day of the DeepSeek stock market selloff, Jim Cramer mentioned the risks that utility companies had talked to him about when it came to investing in power generation. Energy stocks were among the hardest hit during the selloff due to earlier investor optimism about the high power demand from AI. Cramer shared \u201cWell look . . .a bunch of utilities behind the scenes have been telling me, we would like to spend. But what happens if something comes out Carl, that doesn\u2019t burn as hot. Then they would have spent a fortune and they don\u2019t want to go rate payer versus data center. They didn\u2019t want to make that trade-off. And today I think that the AIPs of the world, the American Electric Powers, they may actually catch a nice bid.\u201d\n\nOne concern that co-host David Faber raised during the program was DeepSeek having access to large amounts of data, including the entire Gmail account used to sign up for the service. In response, Cramer shared that he had been trying to cancel his service during the break. \u201cBut they have everything,\u201d he added. He mentioned the amount of time that he\u2019d spent on TikTok and DeepSeek and wondered if he would be able to remove his DeepSeek account if he said \u201cthat I love Mao? Would that help me? I think Mao was a great man and should\u2019ve gotten the Nobel Peace Prize. What would help me at this point? That Tiananmen Square was a great celebration? What do I do? Tell me what to do?\u201d\n\nThe primary reason stocks shed billions of dollars on Monday was that investors wondered if companies would have to spend billions of dollars to set up AI platforms. However, Cramer argued that the argument that some firms might see an ROI improvement from lower costs was very important. He listed the beneficiaries of AI and stated \u201cWe have so many beneficiaries, now we have a healthcare rotation going on, we have the beneficiaries that have really been hamstrung. We have the notion like the Justice Department said under the previous President, there\u2019s been too much concentration.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the environment as the market fell Cramer shared \u201cLook I do think it\u2019s a moment, Carl, where all of us were talking, like it was when we first discovered ChatGPT, and we were playing Haiku.\u201d Yet, he remained skeptical about the accuracy of the data surrounding DeepSeek and R-1. According to Cramer \u201cThe difference here I think is that, if we really think that they are playing by American rules and they\u2019re telling us everything, then maybe that\u2019s why we keep seeing such a great number, a growth number from the Chinese economy.\u201d\n\nOn whether the American GPU restrictions against China had failed after DeepSeek, Cramer maintained that \u201cthe point of the ban was military.\u201d He also believes that President Trump might ban DeepSeek and added \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just shut it down?\u201d Returning to DeepSeek accessing huge amount of data, Cramer said \u201cI\u2019ve been really upset about this. I was playing on it all weekend. And I didn\u2019t realize they were playing me. I mean it is on your PC. They\u2019re like, what are they burrowing through it right now? Are they gonna get like personal things that I\u2019ve said to my wife? Which would be devastating. I mean in a positive way.\u201d\n\nFinally, in his last morning remarks, Cramer shared that he thought that the selloff could have been much worse. According to him:\n\n\u201cYes, I have to tell you that I thought these things, when I first saw this [NVDA share price graph] I\u2019m not saying that I was in a panic but I said look, this could be, a lot of people are going to say this is the end of Mag 7. And of NASDAQ. But people are discerning winners and losers. We have to hear from Jensen, we haven\u2019t yet, Jensen Huang. But frankly, I thought it would be worse.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 27th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 76\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a global media and entertainment giant with a presence in the theme park, film, and television industries. It\u2019s a regular feature of Cramer\u2019s morning show, and the host is nothing but full of praise for the firm. Cramer believes that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\u2019s management, led by Bob Iger, is executing a turnaround strategy well as evident through declining losses at its cable business and a profitable streaming business. Yet, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\u2019s share rose during the DeepSeek selloff and closed the day 1.60% higher. Cramer was exasperated:\n\n\u201cIs Disney somehow a winner? I mean you see these things that are just up and you want to say, are you kidding?\u201d\n\nOverall DIS ranks 7th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer talked about as DeepSeek wreaked havoc on the stock market. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DIS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Ltd Skipper Canteen: Best Overall Restaurant at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: Dr. Falls Signature Grilled Steak, Kungaloosh!\n\nDr. Falls Signature Grilled Steak, Kungaloosh! What you can\u2019t miss: Classic Skipper jokes and immersive theming\n\nClassic Skipper jokes and immersive theming Location: Adventureland\n\nAdventureland Pricing: $$\n\nJungle Navigation Co. Ltd Skipper Canteen \u2014 or just Skipper Canteen for short \u2014 is the best restaurant at Magic Kingdom, irrefutably. This is a Table-Service meal, which means you\u2019ll need an Advance Dining Reservation (ADR), but because it\u2019s tucked away back in Adventureland and doesn\u2019t have the same appeal to kids as other heavy hitters like Cinderella\u2019s Royal Table and Be Our Guest Restaurant, it\u2019s actually not too challenging to book a meal here.\n\nThe experience at Skipper Canteen is a continuation of what you\u2019ll encounter on Jungle Cruise (did I mention that Jungle Cruise is the best ride at Magic Kingdom?). That means it\u2019s got amazing theming, almost like a museum full of artifacts discovered by Dr. Albert Falls on his adventures. And much like the Skippers aboard Jungle Cruise, the waitstaff at Skipper Canteen are chock full of good (bad) jokes throughout your meal.\n\nOh, and what a meal. The Skipper Canteen menu is inspired by the cuisine of Asia, Africa, and South America. Picky eaters might struggle to find something to their liking here, but for the adventurous, there are plenty of tasty bites (like that Brazilian Cheese Bread, a secret item not on the menu!). And Adventurers Club fans will be happy to know that you can order a beer here called Kungaloosh, brewed specially for Walt Disney World.\n\nBe Our Guest Restaurant: Best for High-End Dining at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: French Onion Soup, Grilled Filet Mignon\n\nFrench Onion Soup, Grilled Filet Mignon What you can\u2019t miss: The utter immersion that is Beast\u2019s Castle\n\nThe utter immersion that is Beast\u2019s Castle Location: Fantasyland\n\nFantasyland Pricing: $$$$\n\nBe Our Guest is one of the hardest ADRs to snag, and it\u2019s also one of the most expensive meals at Magic Kingdom. The three-course prix fixe meal is $72 for adults (10 and up) and $43 per child, plus tax and tip. But oh, how it\u2019s worth it. Be Our Guest is easily the most upscale dining experience at Magic Kingdom, with a French-inspired menu that includes trout, filet mignon, and macarons. Weary parents can enjoy a long list of champagnes, wines, and beers.\n\nFans of Beauty and the Beast will not be disappointed by any of the three dining areas: the Castle Gallery, West Wing, or Grand Ballroom. But of course, if you have a choice, the Grand Ballroom is the place to be, as it evokes memories of that stunning scene from the film.\n\nThe Plaza Restaurant: Best for Picky Eaters at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: Bacon Cheeseburger, Plaza Loaded Fries, Dark Chocolate-Banana Bread Pudding with Soy Milk Frozen Dessert\n\nBacon Cheeseburger, Plaza Loaded Fries, Dark Chocolate-Banana Bread Pudding with Soy Milk Frozen Dessert What you can\u2019t miss: Classic comfort food dining\n\nClassic comfort food dining Location: Main Street, U.S.A.\n\nMain Street, U.S.A. Pricing: $$\n\nThe Plaza Restaurant feels like classic Disney. You\u2019ll find it along Main Street, U.S.A., giving it a turn-of-the-century vibe replete with Art Nouveau touches. It\u2019s a Table-Service meal, so you\u2019ll want advanced reservations, but unlike Skipper Canteen and Be Our Guest, which boast menus that are less approachable to those who fuel themselves on chicken nuggets and mac and cheese, The Plaza Restaurant has a menu that everyone, even picky eaters, will love.\n\nThe difference? Unlike other theme park restaurants serving up classic American fare like burgers, chili, meatloaf, and chicken sandwiches, The Plaza Restaurant\u2019s food quality scores high marks. And while dining inside gives you a welcome, air-conditioned reprieve from that Florida heat, you can also elect for an outdoor table, giving you stunning views of Cinderella Castle while you eat.\n\nThe Crystal Palace: Best Buffet at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: Buffet \u2014 get whatever looks good!\n\nBuffet \u2014 get whatever looks good! What you can\u2019t miss: Winnie the Pooh and friends\n\nWinnie the Pooh and friends Location: Main Street, U.S.A.\n\nMain Street, U.S.A. Pricing: $$$\n\nOne of the biggest appeals of The Crystal Palace is the character dining. Being able to knock out a hearty sit-down meal and meet Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, and co. all in one go is a serious time-saver.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an all-you-can-eat buffet to get the most out of your budget, The Crystal Palace has you covered. You\u2019ll find carving stations (get the prime rib), salads, fresh vegetables, and mashed potatoes. Plus all the desserts you can stomach.\n\nCinderella\u2019s Royal Table: Best Princess Character Dining at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: Chilled Jumbo Shrimp, Roasted Lamb Chops, The Clock Strikes Twelve\n\nChilled Jumbo Shrimp, Roasted Lamb Chops, The Clock Strikes Twelve What you can\u2019t miss: Your favorite Disney Princesses\n\nYour favorite Disney Princesses Location: Inside Cinderella Castle\n\nInside Cinderella Castle Pricing: $$$$\n\nOne of Magic Kingdom\u2019s most expensive restaurants is also one of Magic Kingdom\u2019s best restaurants. Like The Crystal Palace, Cinderella\u2019s Royal Table is known for its character dining. This is the best way to see your favorite Disney Princesses, including Cinderella, Aurora, Snow White, and Ariel. If you\u2019re lucky, you may get to dine with Belle or Jasmine. Reservations for Cinderella\u2019s Royal Table are a must (and really hard to get). You\u2019re dining inside Cinderella Castle after all.\n\nThe major downside of Cinderella\u2019s Royal Table is the price. With four people over the age of 10, you\u2019re looking at a lunch or dinner bill of roughly $352 \u2014 and that\u2019s without tax or tip. The menu is prix fixe, and the food is decent, but if forced to choose, we\u2019d go with Be Our Guest\u2019s French-inspired menu when throwing down the big bucks. You\u2019re not so much paying for the food as you are for the experience. And don\u2019t worry: Even though mussels and chickpeas crowd the menu for adults, kids can order familiar favorites like chicken nuggets.\n\nCheshire Caf\u00e9: Best Snacks at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: Cheshire Cat Tail and Mixed Berry Tea Slushy\n\nCheshire Cat Tail and Mixed Berry Tea Slushy What you can\u2019t miss: Alice in Wonderland theming\n\nAlice in Wonderland theming Location: Fantasyland\n\nFantasyland Pricing: $\n\nYou\u2019ve got lots of options for snacks at Walt Disney World, from Mickey Bars to Dole Whip. And while Sleepy Hollow (and that holy of holy Spring Roll Cart) offers great options and Storybook Treats has the scrumptious Peter Pan Float, our must-go place for sweets at Magic Kingdom is Cheshire Caf\u00e9.\n\nWhy? Three words: Cheshire Cat Tail. This is the dessert of desserts at Magic Kingdom. It may not enjoy the same fame as Dole Whip or churros, but it\u2019s colorful, quirky, and delicious. Plus, you can wash it down with a Mixed Berry Tea Slushy. How refreshing!\n\nCasey\u2019s Corner: Best for Nostalgia at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: All-Beef Hot Dog or Chili-Cheese All-Beef Foot-long Hot Dog\n\nAll-Beef Hot Dog or Chili-Cheese All-Beef Foot-long Hot Dog What you can\u2019t miss: A piano player tickling the ivories\n\nA piano player tickling the ivories Location: Main Street, U.S.A.\n\nMain Street, U.S.A. Pricing: $\n\nCasey\u2019s Corner seemingly has limited appeal, specializing in hot dogs, hot dogs, and, well, more hot dogs. But here you can get a variety of (really good) hot dog options, even plant-based options. Walt\u2019s Chili-Cheese All-Beef Foot-long Hot Dog pays homage to Walt Disney himself and includes Walt\u2019s Favorite Chili Recipe. Plus, a staple of any Disney World vacation is listening to the Casey\u2019s Corner pianist tickling the ivories. This is a can\u2019t-miss experience.\n\nFans of Disney deep cuts might even make the connection that the restaurant is inspired by the \u201cCasey at Bat\u201d vignette from one of the earlier Disney animated classics, Make Mine Music. Get to Casey\u2019s Corner early enough in the day, and you might even get to take part in the \u201cfirst pitch\u201d when the restaurant opens.\n\nMain Street Bakery: Best Breakfast at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: Mickey Cinnamon Roll\n\nMickey Cinnamon Roll What you can\u2019t miss: All the Starbucks\n\nAll the Starbucks Location: Main Street, U.S.A.\n\nMain Street, U.S.A. Pricing: $\n\nThere\u2019s no better way to start a day at Magic Kingdom than with a Mickey Cinnamon Roll in the Hub in front of Cinderella Castle. Just be prepared to stand in long lines to get it. Main Street Bakery is especially busy right when Magic Kingdom opens, given its location on Main Street and the fact that it\u2019s the only place to get Starbucks at Magic Kingdom.\n\nLiberty Tree Tavern: Most Filling Meal at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: Patriot\u2019s Platter\n\nPatriot\u2019s Platter What you can\u2019t miss: American history on full display\n\nAmerican history on full display Location: Liberty Square\n\nLiberty Square Pricing: $$$\n\nHistory buffs and fans of massive Thanksgiving meals will both be happy with a sit-down meal at Liberty Tree Tavern. The restaurant pays tribute to our nation\u2019s founders with theming reminiscent of Colonial Williamsburg, with brick fireplaces, candelabra chandeliers, and wood paneling.\n\nWhen you dine, you\u2019ll choose from six rooms representing six important founders:\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nBetsy Ross\n\nPaul Revere\n\nJohn Paul Jones\n\nAnd while the theming is a nice touch (and decidedly different from Disney Princesses or a cartoon mouse), it\u2019s the food that keeps bringing us back. The meals here are so filling that you might have to be rolled out. The menu is prix fixe, with options ranging from salads and toffee cake to the Patriot\u2019s Platter, which is ripe with turkey, pot roast, and pork (plus vegetables \u2014 yes, you have to eat them!).\n\nThe Friar\u2019s Nook: Best Quick Meal at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat to order: Cheddar, Bacon, and Ranch Tots, Tiana\u2019s Famous Beignets\n\nCheddar, Bacon, and Ranch Tots, Tiana\u2019s Famous Beignets What you can\u2019t miss: Mobile Order (it\u2019s a major time-saver)\n\nMobile Order (it\u2019s a major time-saver) Location: Fantasyland\n\nFantasyland Pricing: $\n\nIf your ideal day at Magic Kingdom is go, go, go so you can fit in as many rides, cavalcades, and selfies as possible, skip the sit-down meals. Instead, put in a Mobile Order while you\u2019re in line for Peter Pan\u2019s Flight, then head over to The Friar\u2019s Nook right after to grab your meal and go.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nWhile these restaurants didn\u2019t make our list of the 10 best Magic Kingdom restaurants, we thought they deserved recognition for something special they bring to the Disney World experience:\n\nSleepy Hollow: Where else are you going to get a Fresh Fruit Waffle Sandwich?\n\nWhere else are you going to get a Fresh Fruit Waffle Sandwich? The Diamond Horseshoe: The Diamond Horseshoe can be a little pricy for the quality of food, but it\u2019s actually one of the cheapest spots to grab a beer in Magic Kingdom.

            "content": "Disney+ has signed a landmark agreement to invest 25% of its annual sales generated in France to finance French and European series and films. As a payoff for this commitment, the streamer will be allowed to access newly released films nine months after their theatrical release, a big improvement from the previous 17-month window.\n\nBy comparison, Netflix, which ranks as France\u2019s leading streaming service in terms of subscribers, has a 15-month window; while Apple TV+, which just signed its first ever agreement in France to invest 20% of its turnover in local and European productions, is at 17 months.\n\nUnder their three-year agreement, Disney+ will also made a big push into local movies as it\u2019s signed on to buy or pre-buy and finance a minimum of 70 films over this period, ensuring a diversity of genres and budgets.\n\nThe long-gestated deal follows rollercoaster negotiations with the local industry which fell through at certain times, notably when Disney decided to forgo the theatrical release of \u201cStrange World\u201d in 2022. The forceful move propelled French exhibitors in a state of panic, but also led for negotiations to be re-launched. A Disney spokesperson had called out the French rules for being \u201ccumbersome\u201d and \u201canti-consumer, ignoring how behaviour has evolved over the last several years and putting us at increased risk for piracy.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDisney, like other streaming services, has been on a crusade to see France amend its strict windowing rules for several years. These guidelines are even responsible for the absence of Netflix at the Cannes Film Festival, since the event requires every film in competition to be distributed in cinemas in France. But the country\u2019s main players, particularly the pay TV group Canal+, have been pushing back because they are the biggest financiers of local movies and want to stay ahead with their preferred access to newly released films, which is currently set at six months.\n\nShortly before the Disney agreement was unveiled, Canal+ Group CEO Maxime Saada said in an audition at the Senate that the pay TV group would not continue investing 220 million euros per year in French movies for a six-month window if Disney were granted a nine-month window in exchange for an investment five times lower.\n\nThis landmark deal with Disney is happening as the U.S. studio became France\u2019s top distributor in 2024, with blockbusters like \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis agreement marks an important step for French cinema-goers,\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Etzi, chairman of The Walt Disney Company France. \u201cMaking films accessible to as many people as possible, first in cinemas, then much more rapidly on the Disney+ platform, is an essential first step in meeting the needs of French audiences,\u201d said Etzi. \u201cThis agreement testifies to Disney\u2019s unwavering commitment to the public,\u201d she says, \u201cand its desire to continue working with French talent and producers in the film and audiovisual sectors.\u201d\n\nThe pact has been celebrated by film guilds in France, including the ARP, BLIC and BLOC that regroups producers, filmmakers and distributors. \u201cWe are delighted that Disney+ has joined the ranks of media chronology signatory operators who have signed a financing and broadcasting agreement with the film industry, enabling it to strengthen its support for French and European creation, and offer its subscribers recent films,\u201d said the orgs in a joint statement.",

            "content": "Happy Wednesday everybody. This week was a mixed bag of questions focusing on remakes, sequels, and spinoffs. While I do share my thoughts on some projects, I have also sprinkled some tea you might not know. So, let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhy is live-action Hercules turning into a Hades-focused movie instead of a straightforward remake?\n\nIt should be noted, Disney has yet to confirm this change. That said, Maleficent has proved to be a popular franchise and was a fresh take on Sleeping Beauty as opposed to a more copy-and-paste remake like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin. Also, by centering the story on Hades, the film could delve deeper into his character, motivations, and relationships, providing audiences with a more nuanced understanding of the deity often portrayed solely as a villain. I mean, look at what Wicked has done for the famed Wicked Witch, it is a successful model Disney may want to take advantage of.\n\nWill there be a live Action Little Mermaid 2 movie?\n\nBased on everything I have been told, Disney has no interest in a sequel at this time. There were spinoffs being discussed but those ideas have been axed. What I can tell you is The Walt Disney Company intends to work with Halle Bailey on another project (big-name franchise) but that\u2019s all I can say at this time while I try to get some things confirmed.\n\nAre Bambi, Hercules, and the The Hunchback of Notre Dame live-action films still in development? Are there any casting whispers?\n\nBambi and Hercules (titled Hades) are both still in the works, both projects are searching for new directors. Hunchback of Notre Dame is not in development at this point. There are no casting choices for these projects at this time.\n\nHow much do you think Snow White will make at the box office?\n\nThis is a tough one, this could go one of two ways. First let\u2019s talk best case scenario, $750 million\u2013$1 billion globally, assuming strong reviews, family appeal, and solid overseas performance. The worst-case scenario is $500 million\u2013$700 million globally, similar to The Little Mermaid if the reception is mixed or certain markets underperform. Sadly, this film has seen quite the social media uproar regarding casting and while I do not believe the casting is the problem, we saw what it did to The Little Mermaid\u2018s performance a couple of years ago. The film needs to make at least $340 million to break even and fortunately for Disney, Snow White will not have any major competition when it hits theaters.\n\nIs It true a Descendants 5 is in the works and the filming is set to start between March and May and a potential release date on July 2026?\n\nYes, a new film is in the works but a release date has not been set at this time.\n\nWhat Disney movie spots do you think we\u2019ll get for Super Bowl LlX ?\n\nDisney is expected to make a strong marketing push during the Super Bowl this year. Thunderbolts, Fantastic Four, Snow White, Elio, Tron: Ares, and Lilo & Stitch are expected to debut footage during the big game.\n\nDo you support if Disney cast Jonathan Bailey as Prince Hans in Frozen Live-Action remake? Do you think he suits the role well?\n\nDisney at some point will work with Jonathan Bailey for what project and role? Who knows at this point? I will say I\u2019d like to see him lead a project (Pirates of the Caribbean) not a villain role in a remake.\n\n\n\nWhat are the chances of Disney doing a Brother Bear photorealistic live-action remake?\n\n\n\nSadly, this is a long shot. Brother Bear just isn\u2019t as universally received to people like Lilo & Stitch or Aladdin. While it\u2019s possible, a Brother Bear remake is likely lower on Disney\u2019s priority list compared to more iconic films like The Princess and the Frog or Tangled, both of which are in the works. If Disney continues mining its animated catalog and Brother Bear gains more attention over time, it could happen\u2014just not in the immediate future.\n\nLive action How To Train Your Dragon releases the same day as Elio. Is there concern about Elio losing money at the box office?\n\nYes, I think there is a bit of concern. Both films target similar family audiences, and How to Train Your Dragon benefits from being an already popular franchise, which may give it an advantage over the original IP of Elio, which has had it\u2019s own production problems, which was the reason they moved it from a 2024 to 2025 release.\n\nWill Mickey Mouse and his Friends ever had a new 2D animated short series that\u2019s not aim for preschoolers?\n\nGreat question, it all depends on the demand for it. The success of the 2013 Mickey shorts shows there is interest. As I have always said on The DisInsider Show there is a risk in taking the company\u2019s iconic character and making him a star for older audiences as their tastes change over time. Still, people of all ages love Mickey and the gang, so who knows, but as of now there isn\u2019t anything in the works at this time.\n\n\n\nAre Disney and 20th Century actively trying to launch their next big original franchise or is there any book out there that has the potential to become a succesful franchise if they adapt it? Their last big original franchises were Pirates in 2003 and Avatar in 2009, if I\u2019m not wrong. I think there\u2019s great value in launching a new IP which will create opportunities for sequels, merchandise etc.\n\nLaunching a new IP is a daunting task, Disney is full steam ahead on making the Kenneth Branagh-led Agatha Christie universe a thing as there are multiple projects in the works. That said, 20th Century Studios has a rich list of IPs that are working for Disney with Planet of the Apes, Alien, Predator, and Kingsman, all of which have new movies in the works. Disney tried launching new franchises for instance the studio was hoping The Lone Ranger would be their next \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d but we saw how that turned out at the box office. In the end, we will see both Disney/20th Century Studios continue to launch new material, it\u2019s just a matter of how the audience responds at the box office.\n\nWhen is the Princess Diaries 3 and Sister Act 3 gonna be released?\n\nBoth projects do not have a release date and as far as I am concerned Sister Act 3 is dead at this point. Princess Diaries 3 is still in development but we are ways off a release as there is no production date scheduled for the project at this time.\n\nThat\u2019s all for this week\u2019s mailbag, stay tuned as every week a new DisInsider Mailbag will drop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Post Author",

The project invites a wide range of leading composers to create new solo etudes, each performed by an LA Phil musician, which showcases their distinct voices and the possibility of their chosen instrument. The theme of soloist spotlight continues with Donnacha Dennehy\u2019s threshold-pushing piano concerto Limina and Missy Mazzoli\u2019s bass concerto, Dark with Excessive Bright, which borrows its name from Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost and slips between centuries with Mazzoli\u2019s blend of new ideas and influences. Plus, Adams leads a world premiere by Noah Jenkins, whose music explores everything from drones to audio phenomena.\n\nPrograms, artists, dates, prices, and availability subject to change.

            "content": "The late, great Walt Disney, one of the most influential artists of all time, continues to shape popular culture 58 years after his passing. His creative legacy is everywhere\u2014in Disney\u2019s animated and live-action films, TV shows that captivate on screens big and small, the rides and attractions of Disney Parks, and on theatrical stages worldwide, where Disney on Broadway has become synonymous with musicals both comforting in their familiarity and bold in their theatricality.\n\nWalt Disney shows off the set model for his \"Carousel of Progress\" at the 1964 New York World's Fair, where it premiered (Photo c/o Walt Disney Archives)\n\nDisney has been creating Broadway shows for just 30 years (current smashes: Aladdin and The Lion King), but a visit to Walt Disney World confirms that theatricality has always been part of the 100-year-old company's DNA.\n\nIconic Walt Disney World attractions (top to bottom): \"Carousel of Progress,\" \"It's a Small World\" and \"Enchanted Tiki Room\" (Photos c/o Disney)\n\nSome of the earliest attractions Disney himself created are pure theatrical magic\u2014like the Carousel of Progress he designed for the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair, billed as the \u201clongest-running theatrical production in the world.\u201d This ride guides audiences through a nostalgic journey with an audio-animatronic family in the early 1900s, 1920s, 1940s and today. Equally iconic are the blissfully escapist treats It\u2019s a Small World and the Enchanted Tiki Room\u2014all three feature original songs by the legendary Sherman Brothers of Mary Poppins fame.\n\nEven Disney\u2019s newer attractions\u2014while undoubtedly more outwardly \u201cthrilling\u201d than these midcentury classics\u2014are never straightforward carnival rides. Like any great stage production, the best attractions combine unforgettable characters, stunning design elements and emotional resonance. When those elements come together in modern roller coaster hits like Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind or TRON Lightcycle/Run, the effect is dazzling and, in their way, unexpected high art. It's no wonder these must-see experiences bring fans back to the parks repeatedly.\n\nBroadway \"Frozen\" co-stars John Riddle and Patti Murin take to the stage at Walt Disney World for the Disney on Broadway Series (Photo c/o Disney)\n\nEvery winter since 2017, the artful legacy of Disney is celebrated at the EPCOT International Festival of the Arts, running through February 24 at Walt Disney World. This popular destination brings together artists and Disney fans for interactive art attractions, creative photo ops, animation classes from pros, colorful cuisine options, meet-the-artist storefronts and\u2014maybe best of all\u2014the Disney on Broadway Concert Series, featuring a starry lineup of Broadway headliners performing favorite Disney musical theater songs.\n\n\u201cThis feels like the Super Bowl of Disney on Broadway,\u201d says Jelani Remy, a former Lion King and recent Back to the Future star, who is performing alongside Frozen alum Caissie Levy, the Olivier-nominated star of Next to Normal, in the series through January 30. \u201cIt\u2019s a truly magnificent event for the fans, but also for us.\u201d\n\nThe series features many more delightful Disney star pairings\u2014Patti Murin and John Riddle, Adam Jacobs (Aladdin) and Josh Strickland (Tarzan), Ashley Brown (Mary Poppins) and Alton Fitzgerald White (The Lion King), Michael James Scott (Aladdin) and Kissy Simmons (The Lion King), and finally, Rodney Ingram (Aladdin) and Kara Lindsay (Newsies). This lineup offers a chance to see beloved Disney songs performed by the actors who brought them to life on stage\u2014and perhaps to hear a few unexpected gems as well.\n\nTop to Bottom: \"Festival of the Lion King,\" \"Finding Nemo: The Big Blue... and Beyond!\" and \"Drawn to Life\" (Photos c/o Disney and Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group)\n\nWith these incredible performers headlining over the next four weeks, Walt Disney World feels more Broadway than ever. But park-goers can always enjoy a variety of musical theater offerings. In Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, Finding Nemo: The Big Blue\u2026 and Beyond!, a charming 25-minute musical adaptation of the Pixar classic by Frozen\u2019s Oscar-winning songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, features wonderful puppetry and heartfelt tunes (as well as Broadway vets including Jared Bradshaw, Grant Norman and Lindsay Northen). Also in the park, Festival of the Lion King presents a revue-style celebration of The Lion King with live singing, acrobatics and puppetry.\n\nAt the nearby Disney Springs, the original Cirque du Soleil show Drawn to Life offers an unexpectedly moving exploration of animation as an art form, blending Disney\u2019s iconic artistry with jaw-dropping Cirque performance elements. This collaboration celebrates the timeless magic of Disney storytelling, redefining how you view a pencil or a scrap of paper on an artist's desk.\n\nBack at EPCOT, the Disney on Broadway Concert Series stars perform three 30-minute shows per night on the open-air stage of the America Gardens Theatre in the American Adventure Pavilion, offering ample opportunities to expose Disney's stage magic to new audiences strolling through the countries of EPCOT.\n\nBroadway.com's Paul Wontorek (center) celebrates opening night of the Disney on Broadway concert series with stars Caissie Levy, Patti Murin, Michael James Scott, Jelany Remi and John Riddle\n\n\u201cYou know, these Disney songs\u2026 they\u2019re bangers!\u201d laughs Patti Murin, Broadway\u2019s original Anna in Frozen. \u201cThey\u2019re powerful songs, so it\u2019s a big sing, but we really do get a lot of time to rest, recuperate and take care of ourselves, too.\u201d\n\nMichael James Scott, an Orlando native who takes a leave from his nine-year run as the Genie in Aladdin every year for the series, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re giving you the best of Disney on Broadway! So it\u2019s like eleven-o\u2019clock number after eleven-o\u2019clock number. And we start our shows at 5:30PM\u2026 for theater folk, that\u2019s early! It\u2019s a real shift for us vocally, physically and how we prepare.\u201d\n\nBoth Levy and Murin\u2014Broadway\u2019s iconic Frozen princess duo\u2014have made the Festival of the Arts an annual vacation with their husbands and kids, mixing showtimes with family time.\n\n\"Aladdin\" star Michael James Scott shows off his costume at the \"Once Upon a Stage: 30 Years of Disney on Broadway\" Exhibit (Photo c/o Disney)\n\n\u201cWe got to meet Elsa and Anna in Norway yesterday,\u201d Levy shares. \u201cMy son can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s so proud of his mom for being the original Elsa on Broadway that he tells everyone, including Elsa and Anna in Norway. They knew already, but they stayed in character beautifully!\u201d\n\nMany of the original costumes that stars like Levy and Scott wore on Broadway are on display at Once Upon a Stage: 30 Years of Disney on Broadway, an exhibit that is also part of this year's Festival of the Arts. The beautifully curated event also features puppets, set models, props and information on indispensable behind-the-scenes players like Aladdin tailor Maria Sanchez and quick-change dresser Ritchy McFadden Cauldwell.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been begging to come to this festival,\u201d says John Riddle, who memorably played Hans in Frozen. He had to turn down a previous invite because he had just started a run as Raoul in The Phantom of the Opera. \u201cI was like, \u2018Can I go to Disney?\u2019 And they were like, \u2018Are you crazy?\u2019\"\n\nDisney on Broadway stars performing at this year's festival: Caissie Levy (\"Frozen\"), Alton Fitzgerald White (\"The Lion King\"), Michael James Scott (\"Aladdin\"), Kara Lindsay (\"Newsies\"), Patti Murin (\"Frozen\"), Josh Strickland (\"Tarzan\"), Jelany Remy (\"The Lion King\"), John Riddle (\"Frozen\"), Rodney Ingram (\"Aladdin\"), Ashley Brown (\"Mary Poppins\"), Kissy Simmons (\"The Lion King\") and Adam Jacobs (\"Aladdin\")\n\nAfter a late-night rehearsal at EPCOT, Riddle shares he found himself marveling at the surreal beauty of Spaceship Earth illuminated in the stillness of the park. \u201cCan you believe this is our work right now? Walking through EPCOT at two in the morning? It feels pretty cool.\u201d\n\nFor performers and fans alike, the EPCOT International Festival of the Arts is a testament to Disney\u2019s enduring ability to merge magic, art and theater. It's clear that Walt Disney\u2019s creative legacy continues to dazzle and inspire on every stage imaginable.\n\nClick for more info on the EPCOT International Festival of the Arts.",

            "content": "Forum Forums\n\nPosted:\n\nOvernight, Walt Disney World quietly made a notable change to the wording of its Disability Access Service (DAS) policy. The updated policy no longer includes the word \"only\" in the \"What to Know About DAS\" opening paragraph.\n\nPrevious wording:\n\n\"DAS is intended to accommodate only those Guests who, due to a developmental disability like autism or similar, are unable to wait in a conventional queue for an extended period of time.\"\n\nUpdated wording (January 28, 2025):\n\n\"DAS is intended to accommodate those Guests who, due to a developmental disability like autism or similar, are unable to wait in a conventional queue for an extended period of time.\"\n\nThis seemingly small adjustment raises questions about its implications for how Disney defines eligibility for DAS and its impact on guests.\n\nThe Significance of Dropping \"Only\"\n\nThe removal of the word \"only\" may soften the exclusivity implied in the previous wording. By doing so, Disney could slightly broaden how it interprets eligibility for DAS. While the policy still emphasizes developmental disabilities like autism as the core criteria, the absence of \"only\" could be interpreted as leaving room for other similar conditions that may not fit traditional definitions but still meet the intent of the service.\n\nThis shift may also indicate an effort by Disney to avoid legal or interpretative limitations tied to the term \"only,\" ensuring that the policy language is more inclusive and adaptable. However, no official statement has been made to clarify whether the change reflects a broader operational adjustment or is simply a refinement in wording.\n\nWhat It May Mean for Guests\n\nRemoving \"only\" could allow Cast Members greater discretion in determining eligibility for DAS during the video chat registration process. This might benefit guests with non-traditional or less-common disabilities.\n\nThe previous wording may have inadvertently discouraged some eligible guests from applying, believing they did not meet the strict criteria. The updated language might encourage those who need DAS to register.\n\nWhat Hasn't Changed\n\nIt's important to note that no other changes have been made to the DAS policy. Guests must still register via live video chat and meet the criteria determined by Disney's Cast Members. The primary purpose of DAS remains unchanged: to assist guests who cannot wait in traditional queues due to a developmental disability or similar condition.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Disney has not provided further clarification on this wording change, it could have implications for how DAS is administered. For now, the impact will depend largely on how Cast Members interpret the updated language during the registration process. Guests relying on DAS should continue to provide a clear explanation of their needs to ensure smooth registration.\n\nHow to Register for DAS at Walt Disney World",

            "content": "When I tell you I\u2019m a Disney gal, I mean it. I grew up just outside the Orlando area. Walt Disney World was my \u201cspecial place.\u201d My second home. Some of my fondest memories occurred inside of EPCOT, Magic Kingdom, and\u2014later\u2014Disney\u2019s\u2013MGM Studios, now known as Hollywood Studios.\n\nI remember dancing gleefully when Captain Hook kissed my hand during a parade on Main Street. I recall the excitement I experienced when I met Figment for the first time. And I remember the joy I felt when I finally measured up and was able to ride Tower of Terror, a ride which\u2014at the time\u2013was the ultimate \"big kid\" attraction. I also remember being there with my sister, mom, and dad. And while our family dynamic was far from perfect, in Disney, our memories were of a different hue. So when I had kids, I knew the magic of Disney was something I wanted to share with them, even though my family and I now lived hundreds of miles away.\n\nBut our latest trip, while not our first, would be different. It would be on an abbreviated timeline. We had 72 hours to visit four parks. My husband would not be joining us. It would just be me and my two children. And did I mention we would be traveling on those dates? Yes, it would be a whirlwind for sure, especially with a young child in tow.\n\nI was apprehensive, at best. I wondered if I could pull it off\u2014if we could pull it off\u2014but I quickly realized my fears were for naught because while kids will be kids, i.e. there were the usual parenting hiccups, our three day Walt Disney World trip was as magical as any because Disney remains a magical place. It was also unique because my son finally hit a major milestone: He was able to ride all but five attractions. And this? This transformed our vacation, especially since my children have a five year age gap. It made things easier, allowing us to enjoy rides together.\n\nWhere the Magic Began\n\nDay one began like any other, except earlier. Much earlier. We awoke around 4:00am to get ready and catch a ride to the airport. We arrived at the hotel around lunch time\u2014Disney\u2019s Art of Animation\u2014and were quickly enamored with its oversized characters and quirky charm. We found our room was just as delightful. My son is obsessed with Cars and we were in a Cars Family Suite, which had traffic cone-shaped lights, a sofa which looked like passenger seats, and bumper stickers all around. It also had not one but two pull out (or pull down) beds: a real treat. And then we hopped the Skyliner soon after dropping our bags, headed for a day at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios.\n\nThat\u2019s where the magic really began.\n\nYou see, we had measured my son (multiple times) at home. He is in elementary school but is very small for his age. I didn\u2019t want to promise him anything he couldn\u2019t do, but there were attractions he was excited about trying\u2014one\u2019s he couldn\u2019t on our last trip, two years ago: Rise of the Resistance, Tower of Terror, and Soarin, to name a few. And according to the hashes on our wall, he would measure up. But still, I held my breath.\n\nA cast member near the entrance to Tower of Terror was the first to measure my son. They stood him upright beside a small wooden placard, all while he smiled on. His blonde head poked just above the wood bar and they waved him through. He bounded on, still smiling, his little heart racing\u2014mostly with excitement but also with a twinge of fear. And then, before I knew it, it was time to board.\n\nHe claims he loved it. It was his favorite ride of the trip. His face, however, told a different story. But that story is for another day. What matters is that he got off and wanted to ride it again. (We didn\u2019t, unfortunately.) We did, however, ride many other attractions: in Hollywood Studios, Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, and Animal Kingdom, many of which he rode for the first time. And because he met the height requirements, our little trio was able to enjoy the parks on a different level.\n\nMy daughter was apprehensive about riding alone. She could; she just didn\u2019t want to. But she is older and seeks bigger thrills. Now, we could enjoy these thrills together. It was also so much fun\u2014for both she and I\u2014to watch him react. (Hello, Dinosaur!)\n\nThe trip was also something of a rite of passage. With my littlest meeting so many milestones, he was able to embark on new adventures, experiencing new things\u2014and thrills. He also felt like one of the \"big kids,\" which was truly special for him.\n\nAbout Disney's Height Requirements\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re the parent of a child on the cusp of meeting a height requirement\u2014and you\u2019ve got your next vacation booked\u2014you may be wondering how you can bend the rules, especially if your little one is a half inch too short and has their heart set on a certain ride. But height requirements are put into place for a reason. They are also not negotiable. Children will be measured at every single ride. Sometimes they are measured twice.\n\nThe good news is Walt Disney World has dozens of attractions that have no height requirements. This means that infants can go on these rides. And the rides that do have restrictions? They range from 32 inches or taller to 48 or taller/smaller, depending on the attraction.\n\nDealing with disappointment\n\nOf course, if your child does not measure up, they may be disappointed. I was when I was kid. I remember burying my head into my father\u2019s shoulder and exclaiming how it \u201cwasn\u2019t fair.\u201d But it\u2019s important to explain the requirements to your child using both plain language and empathy. Say something like \u201cI know you\u2019re sad/angry/disappointed right now but you need to be a certain height to stay safe. Let's find something else fun to do.\"\n\nTemper expectations\n\nIt's also important to temper expectations; just because a child meets the height requirement for a ride doesn't mean they are ready. During our trip, my son just tall enough to ride Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. However, after doing my homework (and watching ride videos), I quickly realized he wasn't prepared for an attraction of this gravity. No pun intended.\n\nIf you have a child who is a bit more cautious or apprehensive, you may want to ride the ride first (if you can) or read up on it. A little research goes a long way and can save you pre- and post-boarding tears.\n\nOther Ways to Make Disney Magic\n\nDisney is a magical place\u2014full of whimsy, wonder, and excitement. And while meeting most of the park\u2019s height requirements did transform our vacation, the experience was special because Disney remains a special place. There was magic to be made at every turn. Here are a few ways to make the most of your Disney vacation.\n\nMake the most of little moments\n\nOne of the greatest things about Disney is that magic can be made anywhere\u2014and at any price point. You can book a meal at Cinderella\u2019s Royal Table or, my favorite princess dining experiences, Akershus Royal Banquet Hall, but you can also meet princesses for free around the parks. Many princesses appear in World Showcase in EPCOT, for example, while others appear in Princess Fairytale Hall in Magic Kingdom. Parades and shows are another great way to make the most of little moments. (As I mentioned, it was during a parade that Captain Hook kissed my hand.) And never underestimate the power of Mickey-shaped foods.\n\nArrange for a character wake up call at Disney Resorts\n\nIf you are staying on property, a fun way to add some magic to your Disney vacation is to arrange for a character wake up call. Sure, you could set an alarm but why not wake to an enchanting message from Mickey Mouse.\n\nSetting up your wake-up call is easy. Simply locate the wake-up call button on your phone and follow the prompts to choose your desired time. When the appointed hour arrives, the phone in your room will ring and your children will be overjoyed to hear from one of their favorite characters.\n\nUse the My Disney Experience App to help structure your day\n\nWhile planning may not sound very magical, a little foresight can go a long way\u2014particularly in Walt Disney World. In the My Disney Experience app, users will find maps, a tip board, lists of wait times to their favorites attractions, mobile ordering options, and Genie, a free tool that helps plan your day. Genie is great because it creates a personalized itinerary based on user interests. It displays all of your reservations in one place, and it provides personalized recommendations. All you need to do is to share what attractions, dining experiences, and entertainment options are important to you. Genie will do the rest. Need to adjust your plans? Don\u2019t worry. You can modify Genie recommendations at any time.\n\nMix classic rides with Disney\u2019s latest and greatest attractions\n\nIf this is your first trip to Walt Disney World, or your fifth, you\u2019ll want to be sure to get the most out of your experience. But how? When it comes to riding rides, make sure you're mixing things up. This means riding classic rides like It\u2019s a Small World, Spaceship Earth, and Pirates of the Caribbean in addition to new, big ticket attractions (like Tron and Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind). Why? Well, not only are wait times typically less for \u201cthe classics,\u201d the former also give you a taste of Disney nostalgia, i.e. they are a magical reminder of the way things were.\n\nRemember, you can\u2019t do it all\u2014and that\u2019s OK\n\nWhether you are visiting Disney for three days or 10, chances are you won\u2019t be able to \u201cdo it all.\u201d Walt Disney World is massive and is comprised of four theme parks, two water parks, one shopping and dining district, and an endless array of experiences. Unexpected hiccups may also occur. The rainy season may shut down some of your favorite attractions, even if only for a few hours. A cold snap could close pools and water rides, and your child may have a midday meltdown, causing you to pump the brakes on everything. But having realistic expectations\u2014and knowing things will not go according to plan\u2014is half the battle. Be flexible. Utilize the My Disney Experience app, and (most importantly) have fun.",

But, there\u2019s a new Lightning Lane trend we\u2019re seeing at Disney World that we\u2019re hoping doesn\u2019t stick around for long, and we have a feeling you\u2019ll probably agree.\n\nDon't wait until the last minute! Download our Lightning Lane Multi Pass guide to know ALL the tips & tricks before you go. Get the Guide\n\nIn July 2024, Genie+ was replaced with Lightning Lane Multi Pass and Individual Lightning Lanes are now Lightning Lane Single Passes. These two pay-to-skip-the-line systems \u2014 along with the pricier Premier Pass \u2014 can be a great add-on if your goal is to ride as many rides as possible without waiting in long lines.\n\nOne of the biggest perks of the new systems is that you can book your Lightning Lanes in advance of your trip. Disney World hotel guests (and those staying at select other hotels) can select Lightning Lanes up to 7 days in advance for their entire trip, while every other guest can book them 3 days in advance.\n\nYou may also choose to book yours on the day of your visit. The benefit of booking in advance is the better likelihood of getting the rides and times that you want (however, these are not guaranteed). Since Lightning Lanes can be purchased and booked in advance, Disney shares the daily prices in advance.\n\nAnd, we\u2019ve started to notice that on certain dates in Animal Kingdom, the Single Pass price for Avatar: Flight of Passage is MORE expensive than the Multi Pass price for the rest of the Lightning Lane attractions at this park! Typically, the Single Pass costs around $14 (depending on the season and crowds) per person per day but we have seen it as high as $18 before. The Multi Pass for this park can range as high as $29 per person per day.\n\nSo, if you have Animal Kingdom plans for February 15th, 2025, you can expect to pay more to ride Flight of Passage ($18) than you would pay to gain access to the short lines for nine other attractions ($17). This is the first time we\u2019ve noticed this trend and we hope it doesn\u2019t continue at any of the other parks!\n\nHave you noticed this Lightning Lane trend when planning your Disney World vacation?

            "content": "From Neverland to Wilmington: Meet the area's Disney fairy who continues to enchant all\n\nA real-life Walt Disney character is living her happily ever after in Wilmington after spending her whole life in Hollywood.\n\nMeet Margaret Kerry, 95, the model for Tinker Bell in the 1953 animated movie \"Peter Pan\" and the voice behind one of the film's mermaids.\n\nTinker Bell may only be a fictional character to most, but for Kerry, Tinker Bell is her best friend and other half.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to say that Tinker Bell has done wonders for my life,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nThe pixie fairy has become a beloved staple for Walt Disney and continues to grow.\n\n\u201cI did that work 72 years ago. \u2026 And she is still going strong,\u201d she said.\n\nA snapshot of Kerry's life\n\nKerry was adopted at the age of 3. Her adopted mother moved her to Los Angeles and signed her up for dance classes and acting gigs when Kerry was four. It was then Kerry knew she was born to entertain.\n\n\u201cI would entertain on a bus,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nKerry attended a girls boarding school alongside Walt Disney's daughters. She explained she could get permitted to work quickly if she went to a boarding school as opposed to a regular public school.\n\nWhile working for Walt Disney Studios, she said, she was not allowed to play with other childhood stars because catching a cold meant stopping production.\n\nAs she grew up in the industry, Kerry acted in \"The Little Rascals,\" \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" \"The Ruggles\" and much more. Her work, including voiceovers, spans from TV and movies to radio.\n\nWith over 20 different dialects, 40 individual voices and imagination in her pocket, Kerry was equipped for a lifetime of entertaining.\n\nCreating Tinker Bell\n\n\u201cTinker Bell is wonder, she is absolute wonder,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nKerry's voice, attitude and physique were the inspiration for animators designing Tinker Bell in the 1953 animated film \"Peter Pan.\"\n\nKerry's love for dance influenced the fairy's movements to be dancer-like while her wit and attitude created Tink's unique mood.\n\nIn one of her Tinker Bell Talks events, Kerry said she was filmed for several months performing \"kittenish\" looks and ballet style moves on a large sound stage. Animators, including Marc Davis, then turned her moves and attitude into an animated Tinker Bell.\n\nThe magic was in the animation, said Kerry, noting the Tinker Bell costume was only a green one-piece bathing suit.\n\n\u201cI think Disney Studios is about the best place that anyone could ever work, just an amazing place and to be with all those people with their imagination,\u201d she said.\n\nAnything can happen in the world of Hollywood. During her time being filmed on a sound stage for the role, Kerry said Walt Disney worked on the plans for animatronics in a corner of the room.\n\nProtecting Tink\n\nOver the years, Kerry said she has had to protect Tinker Bell's character of wonder, adventure and curiosity from the world.\n\nSome people will try to make Tink act or pose provocatively, Kerry said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not who she is,\u201d she fired sternly.\n\nTinker Bell is a character of wonder that brings joy, she explained, not a scandalous or sexual character.\n\nThough the green fairy is an important character to many, Kerry said the majority of Tink fans are grown men with Tinker Bell tattoos and fantasies. Many of the men send her fan mail, too, she noted.\n\n\u201cThey had dreams about Tinker Bell,\u201d she said.\n\nThere have even been men who set Tink as a standard for when they look for a wife, she added.\n\n\u201cYou can tell that Tinker Bell has a great deal of meaning to their lives,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nCreating her own fairytale ending\n\nKerry had been married twice before but both husbands passed away. After 90 years of living, the whimsical fairy she inspired eventually led Kerry to her own fairytale ending.\n\nIn 2019, Kerry received an email about a man named Robert Boeke being interested in reuniting. Kerry dated Boeke when she was in her 20s. Boeke is a retired Mobil Oil executive and World War II veteran.\n\nThe yearn to reignite the light sparked after seeing a \"Tinker Bell's choice\" sign in Amsterdam.\n\nThough the first date was long ago, Kerry said she always kept a bracelet Boeke had gifted her and agreed to meet up.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just absolutely remarkable,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nIn less than a year of relighting their love, the two got married in 2020 in California with 400 of their friends and family watching.\n\n\u201cAnd it wouldn\u2019t have happened unless I was Tinker Bell,\" Kerry said.\n\nWhere are the love birds today?\n\nAbout two years after getting married, Boeke surprised Kerry by buying a house in Leland. He lived in the Brunswick Forest community years before and, Kerry said, they both fell in love with the Wilmington area.\n\n\"I just couldn't believe how beautiful this place is,\" Kerry said.\n\nKerry and Boeke recently moved from Leland to the Porters Neck area. Both continue to work, stay active and enjoy each other's company.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED: Keep up with the area\u2019s latest Brunswick County news by signing up for the Brunswick Today newsletter and following us on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\u201cGod and Disney have been looking after me all these 95 years,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nHer passion for dancing and the bright lights of stardom are still alive as she travels to different celebrity shows and conferences to meet and speak with fans.\n\n\u201cI still love Los Angeles, that\u2019s my home,\u201d she said.\n\nKerry's autobiography \"Tinker Bell Talks: Tales of a Pixie Dusted Life\" was published in 2016. The book is filled with stories about her life in Hollywood.\n\nHer newest project involves lyric writing for her \"Just Sayin Songs\" video series. She said she has big plans for her series and that she plans to stay busy.\n\nAs the magic of Tinker Bell continues to shine, so does Kerry's love for adventure and laughter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep entertaining,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nFor more information about Kerry and her upcoming adventures, visit www.tinkerbelltalks.com.\n\nSavanna Tenenoff covers Brunswick County for the StarNews.

Grab your mouse ears and join us on this virtual visit to a California wonder that has captured the imagination of the world for over 70 years.\n\nAbout the guest:\n\nDr. Andi Stein is a professor in the Department of Communications at Cal State Fullerton, where she teaches courses about entertainment and tourism communications. Her Deconstructing Disney class examines the influence of the Walt Disney Company on entertainment and society. Prior to becoming a professor, Stein was a journalist and public relations practitioner in the San Francisco Bay Area.

She is also coauthor of An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry and News Writing in a Multimedia World. Stein has a BA from George Washington University, an MA from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a PhD from the University of Oregon.\n\nHere are some notable quotes from today\u2019s event:\n\nOn how the idea for Disneyland materialized: \u201cThe story goes that Walt Disney had two daughters\u2014Diane and Sharon\u2014and on the weekends he would get to play with the girls and he would usually take them to Griffith Park in Los Angeles. He would sit on a bench in the park and they would ride the carousel, and he would sit and watch them. He would be bored out of his mind because he didn\u2019t have anything to do other than watch the girls on the carousel. And he started thinking, why is there no place where parents can go with their children and have the same exciting experience that they have?\u2026 He got an idea that maybe he should create an amusement park that would be family friendly and where the whole family could come and be entertained.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story goes that Walt Disney had two daughters\u2014Diane and Sharon\u2014and on the weekends he would get to play with the girls and he would usually take them to Griffith Park in Los Angeles.

Now we have Universal Park in Universal Studios in Hollywood. There\u2019s SeaWorld in San Diego; there\u2019s Legoland in Escondido. I don\u2019t know that any of that would be here if it wasn\u2019t for Disneyland, because that kind of set the ball rolling with the theme park industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t necessarily be so much that films might be different, but certainly, the theme park industry would be different.

I don\u2019t know that any of that would be here if it wasn\u2019t for Disneyland, because that kind of set the ball rolling with the theme park industry.\u201d On the appeal of Disneyland: \u201cWhen I walk through the gate, I\u2019m not thinking about work, I\u2019m not thinking about paying bills, I\u2019m not thinking about whatever stressors I have. I\u2019m thinking about how long it\u2019s going to take for me to get on my favorite ride, what am I going to eat for lunch, and what they are selling today in the shops. You get immersed in this world of fantasy for a few hours, or, in some cases, a few days. And it does make you feel good. It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy and happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I walk through the gate, I\u2019m not thinking about work, I\u2019m not thinking about paying bills, I\u2019m not thinking about whatever stressors I have.

It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy and happy.\u201d On what Disney would think of the park today: \u201cI think he would be blown away. I think he\u2019d be really, really proud as well, because he was somebody who was always looking to the future, always looking to what\u2019s the next innovative thing that we can do. He did that with his films. He certainly did it with the theme park. A lot of people who are upset with all the different things that the company has purchased say this is not Walt\u2019s park, but Walt was all about innovation and technology. And Walt himself might be really pleased that the park has grown into what it has and that the company has grown into what it has.\u201d\n\nCheck out these links to some of the topics brought up this week.\n\n",

[Photo/Courtesy of Tyrus Wong Family]\n\nUnder the crystal-blue dome, beneath a cherry tree, stands the lonely figure of a young deer looking into the distance. Leaving an indelible mark on the history of US animated film, this image of Bambi was created by renowned artist Tyrus Wong, whose legacy today, 110 years after his birth in 1910, seems more pioneering and pertinent than ever.\n\nBidding farewell to his mother and sister at the age of nine, Wong, born in Taishan in China's Guangdong province, sailed with his father to a distant land.\n\nEncouraged by his father to practice calligraphy at night in lieu of art school, the young Wong eventually dropped out of junior high school in California to attend Otis College of Art and Design on a full scholarship. He received formal Western art training while studying the art of the Song Dynasty at Los Angeles Central Library in his free time.\n\nWong's Chinese roots and American upbringing allowed his work to flourish in the heartland of the world's film industry, Hollywood, at a time when Asian faces were a rarity.\n\nHe was working as an \"in-betweener\" at Walt Disney Studios at the age of 28, filling out the movements between key drawings, when he learned that the studio was in pre-production for the 1942 feature film Bambi.\n\nTyrus Wong at his home in Sunland, CA 2004, photograph by Peter Brenner [Photo/Courtesy of the Museum of California Art and Design (MoCAD)]\n\nWong went home and painted several pictures of a deer in a forest, influenced by the rich landscapes of the Song Dynasty. These evocative sketches immediately captured the attention of Walt Disney himself \u2013 the lush pastel strokes shot through with a sense of unbounded fantasy, magnificent pairs of antlers blurring into red-orange flame, flickering in the mist of green woods. They were illustrations that allowed you to almost smell the forest.\n\nTo eke out a living, Wong set up a restaurant in Chinatown, Dragon's Den, where he and his fellow artists created giant murals and hand-painted menus. He was later hired as a production illustrator and sketch artist, creating concept art for hundreds of live-action films for Warner Brothers. During his 26 years at the company before his retirement in 1968, he worked on productions including Rebel Without a Cause, Calamity Jane, The Wild Bunch, Sands of Iwo Jima and Auntie Mame.\n\nWong's creativity and drive helped shape the cultural and artistic life of Los Angeles in the 1930s and '40s. Little known to the public in his lifetime, by his death on December 30, 2016 at the age of 106, he had risen to prominence as a highly regarded Chinese-American artist. His story is an inspiration to all those who pursued their dreams in an unfamiliar land.",

            "content": "In a disclosure filed with the SEC it was revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger saw himself getting a 30% pay increase in 2024. The result was a pay package for Iger that totaled $41 million. Most of the pay came in the form of stocks and other options. His base salary was $1 million.\n\nThe 2024 pay package for Iger was in contrast to the $31.6 million that he earned in 2023. In that year, most of the pay came in the form of stock and option awards. Iger is currently contracted to stay with Disney through 2026.\n\nThis is Iger\u2019s second stint as CEO of The Walt Disney Company. It is expected to end in 2026. The new Chairman of the Board for Disney, James Gorman, shared that finding a new CEO is a top priority.\n\n\u201cA critical priority before us is to appoint a new CEO, which we now expect to announce in early 2026. This timing reflects the progress the Succession Planning Committee and the Board are making, and will allow ample time for a successful transition before the conclusion of Bob Iger\u2019s contract in December 2026,\u201d Gorman said.\n\nIn his first annual shareholder letter, Gorman reinforced this goal. \u201cAs Chair of the Succession Planning Committee, I am focused on managing our succession process, and we have continued to make strong progress over the last year,\u201d Gorman wrote. \u201cIn response to shareholder feedback, I was pleased to share an update on our expected timing to announce a CEO successor in early 2026. The full Board is engaged in and committed to finding the right leader for the Company and we are planning for a smooth leadership transition that will enable Disney\u2019s continued success.\u201d\n\nAlong with Iger\u2019s pay package, the pay of other top executives was shared as well. This included CFO Hugh Johnston, who earned a pay package that totaled $24.5 million. Chief legal and compliance officer Horacio Guttierez brought home 15.8 million.\n\nMost of the pay comes in the form of stock and options. Because of this, the take-home packages can vary based on the company\u2019s success. Disney shared that Iger\u2019s payment reflected a reward earned by the successes at the box office, reaching profitability with Disney\u2019s streaming services, and engaging with fans at D23: The Official Disney Fan Event.",

            "content": "Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Walt Disney\n\nWalt Disney Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Chairman of the Board James Gorman bought US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$106 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$112. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Walt Disney insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.\n\nIn the last twelve months insiders purchased 31.76k shares for US$3.1m. On the other hand they divested 5.40k shares, for US$579k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Walt Disney insiders. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nNYSE:DIS Insider Trading Volume January 25th 2025\n\nThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. If investing in lesser known companies is your style, you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nInsider Ownership Of Walt Disney\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Walt Disney insiders own 0.04% of the company, worth about US$73m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Walt Disney Tell Us?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Walt Disney shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Walt Disney insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Walt Disney. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Walt Disney you should know about.",

            "content": "Working at Disney World is a dream for many people!\n\nDisney World is an exciting place to be thanks to the new land coming to Hollywood Studios, the new nighttime show in Magic Kingdom, and so much more. Becoming a Disney World Cast Member is a dream for many but I think it\u2019s time to talk about the things you need to consider before working for the mouse.\n\nWhen I was a Cast Member, I worked for the company through something called The Disney College Program! The Disney College Program, or DCP for short, is a program that college students can participate in that allows them to come work in Disney World while getting college credit.\n\nI participated in this program for 7 months and worked in a few different positions like quick service and merchandise. It was such an incredible time in my life but there are 5 things you need to know before signing up for the DCP! First, you will somehow both over-pack and under-pack before heading out for your program.\n\nThis one is a bit more light-hearted than the other things we\u2019ll discuss but it\u2019s true! For my 7 months, I brought more bags than I care to admit and I used very little of the things I packed but I bought many, many things. From the items you need to decorate your room to your clothes and other necessities, there\u2019s going to be a lot!\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad about packing no matter how much or how little you bring. You\u2019re away from home for several months and things are bound to happen but I was honestly surprised at how much I brought and bought. The thing you need to know next before heading to the DCP is probably the most important thing and it\u2019s that the DCP is a job!\n\nDuring my time at Disney, I worked at the BoardWalk Bakery (now Deli), the Pizza Window, Ample Hills (now BoardWalk Ice Cream), Rock Around the Shop, and Tower Gifts! These jobs were truly so much fun but they weren\u2019t without their challenges.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Disney College Program is a job that requires hard work and long hours. Often at the bakery, I would have 4 AM shifts and at Hollywood Studios I sometimes would work until 1 AM if there were After Hours Events. You also have to focus on customer service and in the spirit of honesty, I had some tough guest experiences that I had to handle.\n\nThey really tested me and helped me grow in a professional environment but many people think of the DCP as living in Disney World and forget about the work aspect of the program. Speaking of, you need to remember you will be blocked out of the parks!\n\nThe Cast Member main gate pass you get while working for the company operates similarly to an annual pass with block-out dates. During busy seasons, especially the holidays, you won\u2019t have access to all of the parks, especially Magic Kingdom! The crowds are coming and Disney wants to make sure they have room for new guests.\n\nThis is an aspect that many people forget about before starting the program and then they are surprised when they don\u2019t have unlimited access to the parks. If you want to go to the parks on a block-out date, you\u2019ll need to buy a ticket. Next up, you need to know not every roommate will be your lifelong friend and that is totally okay!\n\nWhen participating in the DCP, you\u2019ll stay at Flamingo Crossings Village if you don\u2019t have other housing options and you will have roommates. Depending on where you stay, you could have up to 4 people per apartment which is a bit different from my experience. Before Flamingo Crossings was built, the previous housing options had up to 6 people per apartment which was what I did!\n\nI have been lucky enough to build lifelong friendships with some of my roommates from that period of my life but not every single one of them. Just like any situation in life, you will connect with some roommates, and some you won\u2019t connect with as deeply. It doesn\u2019t mean there is negativity but if you\u2019re expecting to become lifelong best friends with every single roommate you might be disappointed.\n\nIt\u2019s just important to remember to be respectful and to remember that this is a shared space for everyone. Be kind to your roommates and hopefully, they will be kind to you. Finally, before doing the Disney College Program you need to remember it is what YOU make it!\n\nThe DCP changed my life in so many ways. It taught me how to make friends as an adult outside of the classroom, it taught me to be independent, how to manage my money, how to be away from home, and what it was like to have a full-time job. I loved the person I became thanks to these experiences but not everyone leaves the program with these same feelings.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you keep in mind that it\u2019s a job with some difficult aspects and not just a few months in Disney World, you\u2019ll be okay! This entire program is what you make it. If you decide to find the silver linings and enjoy the ride, you will!\n\nOverall, I can\u2019t speak more highly of the program but it is important to keep all of these things in mind well before heading to live in Orlando!

The show promises to take visitors on an immersive journey through stories from Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios.\n\nFor the first time, the show will integrate the facades of Main Street, U.S.A. with projections on the Sleeping Beauty Castle.\n\nGuests will rediscover stories from Disney Animation such as \"Pinocchio,\" \"Cinderella,\" \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"The Lion King,\" \"Lilo & Stitch,\" and \"Encanto,\" as well as Pixar films including \"Coco,\" \"Inside Out,\" and \"WALL-E.\" The show will be an immersive 20-minute spectacle combining modern technologies such as drones, synchronized fountains, high-definition projections, and ultra-bright lasers.\n\nAt the center of the soundtrack is \"Live in Magic,\" performed in both French and English by No\u00e9mie Legrand, accompanied by a 100-piece orchestra recorded in London. The soundtrack includes arrangements of over 20 songs from Disney and Pixar animated films, including the original piece \"Live in Magic.\"\n\n\"The projection quality is unprecedented,\" said Metin Cig, the special effects and fireworks designer for the show, according to The Sun. \"We wanted to offer a strong visual experience, notably with the symbol of baby Simba that Rafiki draws on the tree, which then gives way to a magnificent 3D Mufasa appearing in the sky, just like in the film when Mufasa emerges from the clouds.\"\n\n\"It's marvelous. We've never seen such a beautiful light show,\" said Sacha Tellier, a 33-year-old mother visiting Disneyland Paris with her family, according to The Epoch Times. \"It gave me chills. The combination of music, lights, and drones felt like pure magic. I've been to Disney before, but this show is on another level,\" said Nathan Ruiz, a graphic designer from Madrid, as reported by The Travel.\n\nThe standout feature of \"Disney Tales of Magic\" is ultra-bright lasers, including 15 ultra-bright lasers with super-bright colors, which were previously used only once before at the Paris 2024 Olympics during the opening ceremony featuring a performance with Celine Dion. \"The Paris Olympics used it first. But we saw it first,\" said Dana Harrel, executive entertainment director at Disneyland Paris, according to The Washington Times.\n\nThe expansion plan at Disneyland Paris features the addition of the World of Frozen and The Lion King land, which will bring the Pride Lands to life with a log flume cascading from Pride Rock and encounters with characters like Simba and Timon. The World of Frozen will transport guests to Arendelle and include the Frozen Ever After boat ride, along with themed dining, shopping, and accommodations.\n\n\"These projects reflect our commitment to innovation and storytelling,\" said Natacha Rafalski, head of Disneyland Paris, adding that they will further strengthen Disneyland Paris's position as Europe's most important tourist destination, according to The Travel. Disneyland Paris received more than 10 million visitors in 2023, reinforcing its status as the most important tourist destination in France and Europe, surpassing famous landmarks like the Louvre Museum.\n\nThe ongoing \u20ac2 billion expansion at Disneyland Paris is part of a $60 billion global investment announced by Disney in September 2023, aimed at redefining amusement parks, cruise lines, and attractions over the next decade. Despite the challenges, Disney doubled down on its investment in Disneyland Paris, enhancing the visitor experience with new attractions and strategic marketing changes.

            "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Space Mountain, the roller coaster that launched Walt Disney World into a new era, turns 50 years old this month.\n\nThe ride, a key part of Magic Kingdom\u2019s first major expansion, opened to the public on Jan. 15, 1975, three years and three months after the theme park\u2019s debut. The coaster design prompted another wave of interest to the resort and put thrills into the mix.\n\nThe attraction has become a cultural touchstone. The words Space Mountain can indicate scary situations, total darkness, unexpected turns, perceived speed, up-and-down experiences or long, long waits. It deserves its rollicking reputation and remains a favorite today, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe mystique of this ride has always been really alluring to coaster enthusiasts and people that love Disney,\u201d said Chris Gray, vice president of Orlando-based Skyline Attractions.\n\nIt\u2019s a Magic Kingdom must-do, Gray said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a true testament to say that that ride is 50 years old, and people still wait in line for two hours to ride it,\u201d he said.\n\nOut of this world\n\nOn opening day in 1975, Disney hosted astronauts Scott Carpenter, James Irwin and Gordon Cooper, who took early rides on Space Mountain. The trio posed for photos alongside Mickey Mouse, decked out in his own spacesuit. They politely compared it with actual space flight.\n\nFestivities included a massive band of high schoolers, daytime pyrotechnics and the release of doves and balloons. Entertainers Lucie Arnaz and Tommy Tune were there, taping a \u201cWonderful World of Disney\u201d TV special.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of buzz about it. \u2026 There were a lot of people who streamed out there,\u201d said Dean Johnson, a former Orlando Sentinel entertainment editor who helped cover the opening.\n\n\u201cI remember that first ride. It was pretty wild. And it was in the dark, so I wasn\u2019t used to that. It was pretty innovative,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe coaster \u201cwas so fast that they were losing things,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, they might go down under (the tracks) there and find everything from glasses to wallets. \u2026 Cameras, of course. And weird stuff like false teeth.\u201d\n\nThe ride\u2019s theming played off the real-life space race that had intrigued Americans, particularly Central Floridians. Space Mountain passengers boarded rocket-inspired ride vehicles headed into the vast darkness. Other screaming riders streaked by on its twin tracks.\n\n\u201cYou really have no idea where you are,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just a mangled mess of track inside there.\n\nMaking a mountain\n\nSpace Mountain\u2019s roots are in the 1960s. Walt Disney wanted to add a space-themed ride to his Disneyland, building on the success of the California theme park\u2019s Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction.\n\nImagineers worked on the project, but the ride was deemed too big to squeeze into Disneyland. Attention turned to building it in Florida. Making the transcontinental transition was its distinctive dome, designed by Imagineer John Hench, an official Disney Legend.\n\n\u201cThe cone is a logical way of dispersing the energy that is represented by lifting a car to a certain height and letting it run out by gravity in a spiral,\u201d Hench said in vintage footage seen in an episode of \u201cBehind the Attraction,\u201d a Disney+ series.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing greater than riding the monorail through the Contemporary, making that turn and seeing this colossal, futuristic, architecturally perfect building,\u201d said Chris Kraftchick, who is on the operating committee of American Coaster Enthusiasts and a former WDW cast member who had shifts at Space Mountain.\n\n\u201cThat building is so massive it holds two stand-alone coasters that could stand on their own out in the park somewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nBlue LED lighting fills the \u2018Starport\u2019 as guests blast off on Space Mountain during a soft-opening preview at the Magic Kingdom, at Walt Disney World on Nov. 16, 2009. RHR-Z-SPACEMOUNTAIN-0126\n\nSignage at Space Mountain at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World on Jan. 7, 2025, in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The attraction marks its 50th anniversary this month. RHR-Z-SPACEMOUNTAIN-0126 Show Caption 1 of 2 Blue LED lighting fills the \u2018Starport\u2019 as guests blast off on Space Mountain during a soft-opening preview at the Magic Kingdom, at Walt Disney World on Nov. 16, 2009. RHR-Z-SPACEMOUNTAIN-0126 Expand\n\nMysteries of the dark\n\nThe enclosed, dark nature of Space Mountain boosts its mystique and helps create illusion. Unlike an out-in-the-open ride, future passengers cannot spot its features or gauge the coaster\u2019s speed before boarding.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cthat nervousness, that trepidation, that whatever you want to call it, of riding a coaster that you have no idea what you\u2019re about to do,\u201d Kraftchick said. \u201cDoes it go upside down Does it go 100 miles an hour? Do the trains fly by each other so close you can high-five the others? You don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nFor some visitors, it\u2019s a ride of passage. As a kid, Gray said, his cousin hyped Space Mountain.\n\n\u201cShe enveloped us with this mystique about this being the best roller coaster in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she goes, \u2018You know, you had no idea where you were. You were flying through the stars.\u2019 \u2026 I was mystified by that for 10 years.\u201d\n\nAs modern coasters go, Space Mountain isn\u2019t speedy. It gets up to about 28 mph. The current record holder is Formula Rossa at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, which hits 149.1 mph, according to the Roller Coaster Database. Orlando\u2019s speediest is SeaWorld\u2019s Mako, which travels 73 mph.\n\n\u201cThe whole essence of being in the dark with things whizzing by you. \u2026 That always accelerates the pace of things,\u201d Gray said.\n\nOver the years, injuries and deaths have been reported following Space Mountain rides. Sometimes, pre-existing conditions are indicated; sometimes, lawsuits are filed, and settlements are reached. The coaster has been regularly listed on quarterly reports supplied to the state by theme parks.\n\nFlorida\u2019s major theme parks self-report about visitors injured on rides who need 24 hours of hospitalization. No updates are required after those initial assessments.\n\nThe tracks\u2019 knotted design can be a factor with objects coming out of vehicles, and the length of the rails allows many vehicles to be in motion at the same time. (\u201cIt\u2019s a capacity monster,\u201d Gray said.)\n\nLike many coasters, the rails are divided into several segments, separated by braking systems. They are restricted to one car at a time. If the ride must be stopped, it takes time to release each car manually, one at a time, starting with the segment closest to the finish and moving upward, Kraftchick explained.\n\nGlobal appeal\n\nThe minuses have not halted the momentum of Disney World\u2019s five-decade coaster trend. There are now four more coasters at Magic Kingdom alone: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Barnstormer, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Tron: Lightcycle / Run, a 2023 addition and Space Mountain\u2019s next-door neighbor in Tomorrowland.\n\nWDW has enclosed coasters at Epcot (Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, a 2022 debut) and Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios (Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster). Slinky Dog Dash also operates at Hollywood Studios. At Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, Expedition Everest runs an indoor-outdoor route in a mountainous environment.\n\nSpace Mountain was Disney World\u2019s first coaster and is now the oldest roller coaster in operation in Florida.\n\nDisneyland finally got a Space Mountain in 1977, though it features one track in a building about two-thirds the size of the Magic Kingdom original. The Space Mountain brand includes coasters at Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\n\u201cYou say Space Mountain in the amusement realm, anywhere in the world, and people are going to know what it is,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt is pretty crazy to think about the level of theming that Disney was kind of inspired to go to to recreate this, this basically space-warp idea,\u201d said Gray. \u201cThat\u2019s just beyond anything that I think most people were thinking about at the time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe space-based story \u201cmakes it exciting, and it makes it fun, and it makes you want to do it again,\u201d Kraftcheck said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just taking you on a roller coaster. We\u2019re taking you on an adventure into outer space,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took an OK coaster and made it phenomenal.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"",

KABC \u2014 a Disney owned television station \u2014 also helped to spread news of the screenings.\n\nTo make a wonderful experience for these special guests, Disney and The El Capitan also provided free drinks, popcorn, collectibles and film posters. Ghirardelli Chocolate shop \u2014 which has a location next door to the El Capitan \u2014 also sweetened the experience with chocolate bars.\n\nFamilies took photos next to images of some of Disney\u2019s iconic films, often with the help of Disney employees who donate their time to their local communities. These employees are a part of a program at Disney called Disney VoluntEARS.\n\n\u201cDisney VoluntEARS greet all of the families as they come in, making sure that their experience is top notch, and really to that Disney standard,\u201d Sarah Whitney, Senior Manager, CSR at Disney Entertainment, said.\n\nMaking New Memories\n\nThe goal has been \u201cto provide new memories for these families,\u201d Whitney noted. \u201cWe hope that this gives families the opportunity to have that safe space and be able to come back rejuvenated.\u201d\n\nWood has been able to peek into the theatre during screenings and see how the guests are reacting. \u201cIt seems like a joyous, normal moviegoing experience, which is what we wanted it to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe history of Disney is inextricably linked to the LA area and the teams across the company have been working tirelessly to help our hometown community bounce back from these devastating fires.\n\nThat includes committing $15 million for initial and immediate response and rebuilding efforts; Disney Entertainment Television opening its wardrobe warehouse in North Hollywood to employees who lost their homes; assembling hundreds of comfort kits for kids impacted by the fires; hosting various donation drives across the company; ABC News Group expanding its SoCal Strong coverage across platforms; and much more.\n\nThe El Capitan is \u201cDisney\u2019s home on Hollywood Boulevard,\u201d Wood explained.\n\nWood, who has worked at the theatre in various roles since 2001, added that having these screenings in the El Capitan Theatre, \u201ca place that\u2019s close to 100 years old, really showcases that we are going to keep going, that Los Angeles is a place that is strong, that will continue and will always continue.\u201d",

Amid ongoing and unprecedented industry disruptions, we have emerged from a period of considerable challenges well positioned for growth and optimistic about our future. What has long set Disney apart is the way we successfully leverage our businesses to work seamlessly together to generate value. That was again the case this past fiscal year across our Entertainment, Sports and Experiences segments. We have reinvigorated our film studios, which are operating with renewed creative strength. Disney ranked number one at the global box office in 2024 with an impressive slate of films that generated $5.46 billion, including Pixar\u2019s Inside Out 2 and Marvel\u2019s Deadpool & Wolverine, both of which set new records. We were the first studio whose films surpassed $5 billion in box office sales worldwide since 2019 and have led the box office for eight of the past nine consecutive years. In television, our branded series and general entertainment programming have been performing exceptionally well, drawing new audiences and winning an unprecedented number of accolades in fiscal 2024, including a record-breaking 60 Emmy Awards. We continued to make progress toward turning our streaming businesses into significant growth drivers for the Company. This past year we delivered profitability for our streaming businesses, and in just five years we have built Disney+ into a streaming destination unlike any other with more than 120 million Disney+ Core subscribers at the end of fiscal 2024. And with the recent additions of the Hulu and ESPN tiles on Disney+, we have expanded the high-quality entertainment options accessible within a single platform for bundle subscribers. We are focused on ESPN\u2019s continued evolution as the preeminent digital sports platform, serving fans anytime, anywhere. We have successfully obtained long-term rights to many of the most popular live sports, including the NFL, college football and our recently renewed NBA and WNBA deals, securing an industry-leading portfolio of sports programming. We are also excited for the launch of ESPN\u2019s flagship direct-to-consumer offering in 2025. Our Experiences businesses remain the gold standard for the industry, and we are confident in the segment\u2019s long-term prospects and committed to investing to drive continued long-term growth. Our footprint continues to grow with multiple projects and expansions currently underway at our parks around the world. We are also expanding Disney Cruise Line, allowing us to bring our most beloved IP into markets where we don\u2019t have theme parks. This past year we debuted a new island destination \u2014 Lighthouse Point \u2014 and we recently launched our latest ship \u2014 the Disney Treasure \u2014 in December. In addition, our collaboration with Epic Games will bring together Disney\u2019s beloved brands and franchises in a transformational new games and entertainment universe. For all these strategic priorities, creative excellence remains at the center of our work as we build our businesses and seek to drive shareholder value. We will continue to strive to keep high quality and bold storytelling front and center for our Company to set us apart from others. On behalf of the senior leadership team, thank you for your continued support of The Walt Disney Company and the wonderful storytelling and experiences we create. I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished over the past fiscal year, and I am confident in our continued ability to drive sustained growth and create shareholder value. Sincerely, Robert A. Iger Chief Executive Officer",

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.45b US$8.63b US$9.70b US$11.9b US$12.9b US$13.7b US$14.3b US$14.9b US$15.5b US$16.0b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x11 Analyst x11 Analyst x7 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 5.86% Est @ 4.89% Est @ 4.21% Est @ 3.73% Est @ 3.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$6.9k US$7.4k US$7.7k US$8.8k US$8.8k US$8.6k US$8.4k US$8.1k US$7.8k US$7.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$80b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$16b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (8.0%\u2013 2.6%) = US$307b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$307b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$143b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$222b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$111, the company appears about fair value at a 9.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.300. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Walt Disney\n\nStrength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Entertainment market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Current share price is below our estimate of fair value. Threat Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

            "content": "After finally meeting the market in 2024, the House of Mouse is ready to beat the market in 2025.\n\nAfter several years of market underperformance, Walt Disney (DIS 1.83%) finally came to play in 2024. The shares rose 24% last year, roughly in line with the previously elusive S&P 500. Now that the entertainment giant was finally able to meet the market, it's time to beat the market in 2025.\n\nA lot of things can go right for Disney in the new calendar year. Let's look at some of the catalysts that could turn a market laggard over the last four years into a leader.\n\nYou can't spell mouse with \"mo\"\n\nMomentum is on Disney's side these days. Many of its recent shortcomings are now leading the way. After a rare showing in 2023 when it was not the box office champ, the studio put out the three highest grossing movies of 2024. The Disney+ led streaming segment that just a couple of years ago was posting billions in annual operating losses turned profitable earlier than expected. Its market-leading theme parks that were shut down for a long time early in the pandemic are more lucrative now than they were before the global COVID-19 crisis.\n\nWith Disney's market cap now back above $200 billion, the optimists are finally starting to be rewarded with the fairy tale finish that was elusive in recent years. Things aren't perfect. Revenue growth has been in the single digits for four of the last five fiscal years. The turnaround since Bob Iger returned as CEO has been focused on the bottom line.\n\nDisney has topped Wall Street profit targets in each of the four quarters of fiscal 2024. Net income is growing a lot faster than the top line. Revenue inched a mere 3% higher last year for the House of Mouse, but adjusted earnings scored a 32% jump in fiscal 2024 with a 39% surge in its latest report.\n\nThe good and the bad of 2025\n\nIger has completed most of the operating optimization that he was hoping to achieve before he steps down near the end of next year. This year may seem rather ordinary on paper. Analysts are modeling just 4% in revenue growth in fiscal 2025. Disney's guidance calls for adjusted net income to rise in the high single digits.\n\nThere will be more seed planting than harvesting at Disney this year. It's in the process of building out massive expansion projects at both domestic theme parks that will bear fruit when they open in the next few years. Now that Disney is one of the few legacy media companies with a profitable streaming platform it can start to lay the groundwork of scalability for Disney+ in the future.\n\nDisney will add another cruise ship to its fleet later this year. It has announced major additions to its premium cruise line twice over the last six months. This is more important than you think. If Disney shares rising 24% in 2024 is applause-worthy, the country's three largest cruise lines soared an average of 47% last year. The industry almost doubled Disney's stock return, even though Mickey Mouse is growing his fleet the fastest.\n\nHeading out to the local multiplex, Disney will have fresh installments in the Captain America, Zootopia, and Lilo & Stitch franchises hitting theaters in 2025. However, it's going to end the calendar year with what should be the largest film of the year. Avatar: Fire and Ash will roll out in December. The first two movies in James Cameron's series are among the three highest-grossing films of all time.\n\nIs Disney stock cheap right now? The leisure tastemaker is trading at a reasonable 20 times this year's adjusted earnings estimate. Disney itself sees a return to double-digit bottom-line growth in fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027. Safeguarding against fumbling the CEO transfer this time around, Disney's board has said it will announce Iger's successor early next year.\n\nHeadwinds are becoming tailwinds. With valuations extended for many of the recent market tech leaders, Disney is emerging as a compelling flight-to-safety play in 2025. It knows it needs to stick the landing this time, and investors are ready.",

            "content": "When new attractions come to Walt Disney World, it almost always means that old attractions must close at Walt Disney World. It\u2019s the circle of life. This means that excitement for new rides is often balanced by sadness that old attractions are going away. I try to always look on the bright side of replacements. Yes, something I enjoyed will be gone, but hopefully the new thing will be even better. This means that even though I am sad to be losing the Muppet Courtyard at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios, I\u2019m also looking forward to the new Monsters Inc. land that will take over the space, and that\u2019s happening a lot sooner than I thought.\n\nToday, Walt Disney World announced the closure dates for the three locations inside the Grand Avenue area of Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios, also known as the Muppet Courtyard. Melrose\u2019s Ristorante Italiano will have its last day on May 10, and it will be followed by fan-favorite restaurant PizzeRizzo and Muppet*Vision 3D, which will see their last day of business on June 7.\n\nSeeing the Muppet Courtyard closing down in less than six months, and specifically Muppet*Vision 3D closing that soon, is certainly a surprise. While we\u2019ve known that Muppet*Vision was closing since November, we\u2019ve also known that the Rivers of America was being replaced at Magic Kingdom for months longer than that, and we still don\u2019t know when that work is starting. Muppet*Vision 3D surviving a bit longer seemed more likely.\n\nI\u2019ve Been Excited By The Monsters Inc Door Coaster For Years\n\nOn the one hand, this excites me because it means that the new Monsters Inc. land will be opening that much sooner. While we don\u2019t have an official opening widow, the sooner one ride closes, the sooner its replacement will open. Pf all the things that were announced at last year\u2019s D23 event that I\u2019m excited about, and there was a lot, one of the biggest was the reveal that the long-rumored Monsters Inc. Door Coaster was finally happening.\n\nWe sometimes hear rumors about attractions being developed by Walt Disney Imagineering that are never officially announced. One of those in recent years was a roller coaster themed after the door conveyor belt sequence from the first Monsters Inc. movie. At one point, it was believed the attraction might replace the Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, but we never heard anything about it.\n\nAfter enough time goes by, you forget about the things that don\u2019t happen, which is why I, and many others, were shocked at D23 to see Billy Crystal take the stage to announce the land based on Monsters Inc., and then Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D\u2019Amaro confirmed the coaster was part of the land.\n\nThe new ride will be the first suspended coaster ever in a Disney Park. It will also include a sequence where ride vehicles are lifted vertically from one track to another. It looks and sounds incredible.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nI Probably Won\u2019t See Muppet*Vision 3D Before It Closes\n\nAs excited as I am that the Door Coaster is moving forward, I am still lamenting the loss of Muppet*Vision 3D. But my biggest issue isn\u2019t that it\u2019s going away specifically. It\u2019s that because these wheels are turning so quickly, I likely won\u2019t get to experience the show one more time before it\u2019s gone.\n\nI live 3000 miles away from Walt Disney World, and while my job makes me lucky enough to visit Walt Disney World, usually at least once a year, and sometimes more, I don\u2019t expect I\u2019ll be hitting the parks before June. As such, I may never see Muppet*Vision 3D again.\n\nI expected I\u2019d have more time. When Disney World announced that Dinoland U.S.A. was getting replaced, it made sure to plan that construction in a way so that fan-favorite attraction Dinosaur would remain open. The work on the Tropical Americas area of Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom has begun, but Dinosaur is expected to remain open through the end of 2025.\n\nDoing something similar with Muppet*Vision and keeping it open while the rest of the land went under construction was likely impossible simply due to the geography involved. But considering one land at Disney World is already being worked on, nobody would have been shocked if nothing had happened with the new Monsters Inc. land for even a couple of years. Disney World has a lot of new things planned and nobody expects them all to happen at once.\n\nAlong with the closure, Disney World reiterated a previous statement indicating hopes to \u201cpreserve the film and other parts of the experience.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what exactly that means. Maybe it means that I will have a chance to watch Muppet*Vision 3D again someday in the future. Even if that day comes, it's probably years away, but who knows, sometimes things happen faster than you think.",

            "content": "Planning a Walt Disney World vacation this year? You\u2019ll need to stretch your dining budget further as Disney World increased hundreds of prices for snacks, drinks, and the most iconic Disney eats at the end of 2024. Nothing is safe. Mickey pretzels. Dole Whip. Even a bottle of water. It\u2019s all more expensive now. But you can save money at Disney World by bringing your own food and drink. Well, some of it.\n\nIn 2020, security responded to a scene at Disney Springs where a family had created a makeshift camp grill with a roasting pan and hot dogs. It was a bold choice to be sure. We\u2019d love to tailgate at Disney World, but that is absolutely not allowed. And not just for the DIY fire. Technically, you can\u2019t bring hot dogs to Disney. Unless you pickled them. Or had a pocket full of canned Vienna sausages. That\u2019s all totally fine.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about bringing food into Disney World parks.\n\nCan You Bring Drinks Into Disney World?\n\nBYOW. Water bottles are allowed as long as they\u2019re not glass. And each park has water bottle-filling stations as well as the ol\u2019 money-saving trick of asking for a cup of free water at quick service counters instead of buying the now $4 Dasani bottle at kiosks.\n\nYou can bring other drinks into the parks as long as they\u2019re not alcoholic and aren\u2019t in glass containers. This is a great way to save on soft drinks, juice boxes, and electrolyte drinks for the summer. I like to partially freeze a sports drink in a water bottle so that when I\u2019m in the parks I have an electrolyte slushie.\n\nWhat Food Is Allowed in Disney World?\n\nAccording to Disney World\u2019s park policy, as long as the food doesn\u2019t require \u201cheating, reheating, processing, refrigeration, or temperature control,\u201d it\u2019s allowed. Shelf-stable snacks are a great thing to toss in a purse or backpack. I love Disney popcorn, but it\u2019s more economical for my family to bring a bag of popcorn from home.\n\nLike water bottles, food cannot be stored in glass containers. The only exception is small baby food jars. Another rule: Food can\u2019t have \u201cpungent odors.\u201d So leave your fermented fish and kimchi at home.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that food items will flag you at security, though in my experience my umbrella seems to set off the scanners more often than a water bottle. However, Disney World does state that you should let Security Cast Members know that you are bringing in food when you go through security.\n\nGetty Images\n\nCan You Bring a Cooler Into Disney World?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: A PB&J or a cup of applesauce is pretty shelf-stable but everything needs \u201ctemperature control\u201d in Central Florida in the summer. Enter the cooler. This is how my family did lunches at Disney growing up. It kept costs down for a family of four and prevented snacks from turning into melted goo.\n\nToday, coolers are allowed as long as measurements are smaller than 24 inches long by 15 inches wide by 18 inches high, and there are rules about the type of ice you can use in a cooler. \u201cLoose pack\u201d and dry ice aren\u2019t allowed, but reusable ice packs are fine.\n\nA cooler also allows fans of soda that aren't under the Coca-Cola empire to have their favorite ice-cold drink in the park. A cooler full of Cheerwine, Ale-8, or Buffalo Rock on the Magic Kingdom hub lawn sounds pretty perfect.\n\nNow, you likely don't want to lug a cooler around the parks all day so each park has lockers to rent for a daily fee. Small lockers (12\" x 10\" x 17\") in each theme park and standard lockers (12.5\" x 10\" x 17\") in each water park are $10 a day. Large lockers (15.5\" x 13\" x 17\") are available at all parks but are $12 a day in theme parks and $15 a day in water parks. And both Magic Kingdom and EPCOT have jumbo-sized (17\" x 22\" x 26\") lockers for $15 a day.\n\nWhat Cutlery Is Allowed in Disney World?\n\nEven if you\u2019re not bringing a full lunch into the parks, reusable cutlery is a great thing to throw in a purse or backpack, especially if you\u2019re dining around World Showcase for an EPCOT festival. But leave the knife at home. All knives are prohibited and, yes, that includes reusable metal cutlery.\n\nAre There Mini Fridges at Disney World?\n\nDisney's Baby Care Centers in each park are not able to accommodate bottles or food storage. However, there are microwaves and a kitchenette area with a sink for use.\n\nFor a fridge, you can book a premium patio at Disney's Blizzard Beach Water Park and that comes with a mini fridge. This is clutch if you\u2019re pumping or have medication that needs to be refrigerated.\n\nThese private rentals come at a steep price, but if you\u2019re celebrating a birthday or have a big family, it\u2019s a great way to bring homemade cupcakes or allergy-friendly foods that would get squished in a cooler.\n\n",

            "content": "Walt Disney (DIS 1.83%) investors who were confident about a rebound in 2024 got a kind of rebound. Disney stock gained 24.5% last year, and I include that half percent because it was just a half percent off the S&P 500's 25% gain. That's not too bad, but not exactly magnificent.\n\nAre Disney's better days over? I don't think so. I don't expect Disney to run circles around the broader market, but I do expect it to keep its top spot in entertainment and media, increase its dividend, and create shareholder value. Here are three reasons to buy it, and another reason to buy it right now.\n\n1. Streaming is now profitable\n\nAs the leading global content creator, it's not surprising that Disney has developed one of the most competitive streaming platforms in the world. That includes Disney+ as well as Hulu and ESPN+. It has been one of the top media companies for decades, with a portfolio that includes the ABC network and several smaller networks, but it made an early switch to streaming in 2019.\n\nThat switch proved providential when the pandemic forced people inside just a few months later, but the accelerated rollout weighed on the bottom line for too long. Disney+ quickly catapulted to the top of streaming, but it took until this past summer to report a profit.\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter (ended Sept. 28), entertainment streaming, which excludes sports, reported $253 million in operating income, up from a $420 million loss last year. Total streaming operating income was $321 million.\n\nThe company ended the quarter with $174 million total streaming subscriptions, including 120 million core Disney+ subscriptions, 4.4 million more than last year. The ad-supported platform contributed 14% of the growth. Management is expecting an $875 million increase in entertainment streaming operating income in 2025.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) for the year increased from $1.29 to $2.72, and management is guiding for a low increase in adjusted EPS for 2025.\n\n2. Disney has expected hits in the pipeline\n\nDisney is a huge company with many different moving parts. In general, the system works well because even if one part isn't pulling its weight, the others can make up for it. When it all works together, it's a beautiful symphony worthy of a Disney smash hit.\n\nSpeaking of smash hits, Disney, through its various top studios, is expecting several blockbuster releases coming up. The company typically accounts for many of the top films in any given year, giving it an unrivaled lead in the film industry. In 2024, it had the three top-grossing films worldwide, Inside Out 2, Deadpool & Wolverine, and Moana 2, plus No. 7, The Lion King: Mufasa, which was only recently released.\n\nIt has 10 films slated for release in 2025, and most of them are sequels or based on previous content. They include Avatar: Fire and Ash and the live-action Snow White, and it already has more expected blockbusters into 2028, with another Avatar coming out in 2026 and the third Frozen movie in 2027.\n\nDisney's model is to create compelling content and then milk it for all it's worth with more content based on the same characters, both in theater and streaming, plus park rides, products, and more. It actually releases very little completely new content, and when it does, it's with the hope that it will be another moneymaking franchise.\n\n3. Parks are performing\n\nParks are the standout Disney assets because they are unparalleled anywhere in the world. Although you might say the same for Disney's content library, it still has competition from other film studios and streamers, while the parks and experiences are in a class of their own. In some ways, they're the glue that holds the model together and makes Disney a differentiated leader. Fans see the shows and buy the products, but visiting a Disney park can be a once-in-a-lifetime (or more for loyal fans) experience that makes the magic happen.\n\nThe parks and experiences segment was mediocre in the fourth quarter, with a 1% sales increase and 6% operating income decrease. Management is expecting that to pick up as the American consumer becomes stronger, and Disney is invested in new rides and experiences, like themed resorts and cruises, to benefit from a strengthening customer down the line.\n\nLast thing -- why now\n\nDisney reports earnings on Feb. 5. As the company turns a corner on streaming profits and expects a strong parks consumer, there's a good chance the news will be positive. But don't buy it for a post-earnings jump; there's no guarantee of that. Consider Disney stock for its industry-leading position. Its recently reinstated dividend doesn't hurt, either.",

These events range from the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics to the 250th Anniversary of the United States of America.

He also oversaw the opening of the Avengers Campus, the reimagining of Pixar Place Hotel, and the transformation and expansion of Downtown Disney District. He also has led the continued expansion of Disney California Adventure, including recent announcements about two new attractions coming to Avengers Campus.

He will also guide Disneyland Resort in a new era of growth with DisneylandForward. Mazloum recently led Disney Signature Experiences where the Disney Cruise Line expanded and secured investment and development plans that will double the fleet size by 2031. Before this role, he held various leadership positions at Walt Disney World Resort. He oversaw Operations, Resorts, Transportation, ESPN Wide World of Sports, Club 33, Disney Springs, and more. In his new role, Mazloum will continue to report to Josh D\u2019Amaro.\n\nPresident of Disney Signature Experiences\n\nJoe Schott is the new President of Disney Signature Experiences (DSE). This division of Disney Experiences was previously led by Thomas Mazloum. It offers family travel and leisure experiences beyond the theme parks. It includes the Disney Cruise Line (DCL), Disney Vacation Club, Aulani \u2013 A Disney Resort & Spa, Adventures by Disney, Storyliving by Disney, and more. Schlott has worked for Disney for four decades. Since 2019, he led Shanghai Disney Resort as President and General Manager. In that role, Shanghai Disneyland expanded with a new Zootopia-themed land and added new attractions and entertainment. There is also a third hotel and a new Spider-Man-themed attraction in development. Before leading Shanghai Disney Resort, Schlott led operations at Disneyland Paris and was Executive Managing Director of Walt Disney Attractions Japan at Tokyo Disney Resort. Disney shared that Schott has a vast experience in global markets and extensive knowledge in international operations that will be pivotal to the future of Disney Cruise Line as it continues to expand to new destinations globally. Schott will report to Josh D\u2019Amaro.\n\nPresident & General Manager of Shanghai Disney Resort\n\nAndrew Bolstein has been named the President & General Manager of Shanghai Disney Resort. Bolstein was part of the opening leadership team for the resort and worked hand-in-hand with imagineers as the park came to life. He has a three-decade career with Disney that started at Walt Disney World Resort. During his career, he has had leadership roles in Hong Kong and Tokyo. He has been in Shanghai for nearly 13 years. Bolstein has vast operational knowledge, a passion for the Disney Cast Members, and the surrounding community. He also has strong relationships with key government, business, and industry partners. Andrew will report to Jill Estorino, President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International.\n\nDisney shared that the transitions to the new roles will begin immediately.\n\nDisney Experiences has a vast reach that includes over 40 countries. It has global theme park travel and experience businesses that include 12 parks around the world, the Disney Cruise Line, and its Disney Consumer Products division which brings Disney IP into homes around the world.

Chief Executive Bob Iger received a $41.1-million pay package last year, according to a filing Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThat figure is about 30% higher than his 2023 compensation, which totaled $31.6 million. Iger\u2019s pay was a mix of cash bonus, stocks and options, with a base salaryof $1 million. The executive\u2019s payout is largely tied to company performance.\n\nThe Burbank media and entertainment company said Iger, 73, was rewarded for Disney\u2019s performance at the box office, which included two billion dollar-grossing films with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d reaching profitability in its streaming business, as well as successful fan engagement at its D23 convention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIger, who is now on his second go-round as Disney chief, has long been one of the highest-paid CEOs in the media business.\n\nHis pay increase comes as the company continues to vet potential successors. Iger\u2019s contract ends in December 2026, but the Disney board of directors has said that it will name the next CEO by early 2026 to allow for a successful transition.\n\nThis time, there is no room for error.

            "content": "Last week, Disney VoluntEARS quickly mobilized to assemble hundreds of Disney-themed comfort kits and care packages for kids staying in American Red Cross shelters in response to the tragic wildfires impacting the Los Angeles area.\n\nDisney VoluntEARS put together the comfort kits, including coloring and activity books, plush, and more provided by the Disney Experiences team. VoluntEARS also packed boxes of new items including books, chairs, games, blankets, and more to help fill the kid\u2019s space in the Pasadena shelter.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one company that can bring a smile to somebody\u2019s face when they\u2019re going through their most difficult time, it\u2019s Disney,\u201d Josh D\u2019Amaro, Chairman, Disney Experiences, said. \u201cYou look at operations like this, where Cast Members are coming together, everyone wants to reach out and help. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Disney is working with the American Red Cross to identify other ways to bring a little bit of happiness to the kids and families staying in shelters, including potential Disney movie screenings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful for Disney\u2019s unwavering support of our mission and their generous commitment to help those in need,\u201d Cliff Holtz, president and CEO of the American Red Cross, said. \u201cJust last week, I was able to connect with Bob Iger when he visited an American Red Cross shelter in Pasadena. I can\u2019t thank the Disney team enough for standing with us to bring hope and comfort in the wake of these devastating wildfires.\u201d\n\nMobilizing for a Cause\n\nWith so many children and families displaced as a result of the wildfires, Disney teams have been dedicated to supporting nonprofit organizations serving the local community and employees in Southern California.\n\n\u201cThe Disney VoluntEARS came together at a moment\u2019s notice to help us compile these comfort kits and care packages,\u201d Karen Kawanami, Manager, Corporate Social Responsibility, Disney Experiences, said. \u201cThey care so much about the communities and the nonprofits that Disney works with.\u201d\n\nVolunteering is an important part of The Walt Disney Company\u2019s culture, and with thousands impacted by the Los Angeles area fires \u2014 including Disney Cast Members, employees, and their families \u2014 the Disney VoluntEARS leapt into action.\n\n\u201cThis is really part of the DNA of our company,\u201d John Breckow, Director, Corporate Social Responsibility, Disney Experiences, said. \u201cOur employee base has such a strong sense of community, of giving back. Frankly, that\u2019s why I work here.\u201d\n\nCalling it \u201can all-hands-on-deck moment for Disney,\u201d Breckow said it was a company-wide effort to gather everything required to fill the comfort kits and care packages.\n\n\u201cWe have VoluntEARS from everywhere, but we\u2019ve also got items from everywhere. We have Mickey Krispie treats from Disneyland, and we have coloring books from Disney Consumer Products,\u201d he said.\n\nD\u2019Amaro went on to say that \u201cfor kids who have gone through a situation like this, where maybe they\u2019ve lost their home and they find themselves in a shelter, to open a Disney bag, to see a Disney plush inside, and to be able to read a Disney book \u2014 these are things that warm people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\nInvesting in Each Other\n\nFor many of the Disney VoluntEARS assembling comfort kits and care packages for the American Red Cross, the event felt especially personal. Being able to give back during such a difficult time \u2014 and to do so with colleagues and friends \u2014 also reaffirmed a sense of community and pride among the Disney VoluntEARS.\n\n\u201cWe are headquartered here; this is our home,\u201d Breckow said. \u201cWhen you live in Los Angeles, you take care of Los Angeles. I\u2019m so proud to see how we here at Disney rally in a moment like this.\u201d\n\nVoluntEARS efforts like this are just one way that Disney is offering support to its community and employees impacted by the tragic event.\n\nEarlier this month the company announced it is committing $15 million for initial and immediate response and rebuilding efforts in the area \u2014 including funding for the American Red Cross, an organization that Disney has supported for decades. Disney recently opened its wardrobe warehouse to help support employees, production crews, and their families who lost their homes and Good Morning America announced on Friday that more than $6 million was raised as part of ABC News\u2019 SoCal Strong. Disney is also airing the American Red Cross wildfire PSA across ABC, ABC Owned TV stations, Freeform, FX, Nat Geo, and Hulu.\n\nFor more information on the company\u2019s social responsibility efforts, visit impact.disney.com.",

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the entertainment company had lost 3.43% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 1.39% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Walt Disney in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on February 5, 2025. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.45, indicating a 18.85% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $24.7 billion, reflecting a 4.87% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nDIS's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.41 per share and revenue of $94.94 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +8.85% and +3.91%, respectively.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Walt Disney should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. At present, Walt Disney boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Walt Disney is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 20.08. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 21.51.\n\nWe can also see that DIS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.94. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Media Conglomerates industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.43.\n\nThe Media Conglomerates industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 169, which puts it in the bottom 33% of all 250+ industries.",

            "content": "Close your eyes. Think back to the first piece of art you can remember having an impact on you. The first song, film, or book that you can remember catching your eye and holding your fascination.\n\nChances are, if you grew up in the United States, you just thought of something produced by, or in connection with, The Walt Disney Company.\n\nThe media giant, which is the only entertainment company to rank in the top of the Fortune 500, is one of the largest generative corporations in the world. Since its founding 102 years ago, Disney has worked its way into the everyday lives of just about every person in the United States, from nature lovers (National Geographic) to sports fans (ESPN), and of course, to the legion of arts aficionados who have embraced Disney's vast output in just about every artistic discipline known to man. From performance art to pottery, Disney has tried their hand at it all.\n\nSince 2017, Disney has celebrated this array of artistry with the Festival of the Arts: held at the beginning of each year in Walt Disney Worlds EPCOT park, the festival mirrors EPCOT's mission of cultural exchange by presenting just how many artistic disciplines can thrive together under the Disney umbrella. From animation classes with Disney artists to a massive group paint-by-numbers mural to exclusively curated culinary delights in the different country pavilions, every day of the festival has something new and enriching on offer.\n\n\n\nThe 2025 Festival, which runs through February 24, is paying special attention toward the theatre arts. Last spring, Disney Theatricals turned 30 years young, making this year's festival the first soire\u00e9 since the anniversary. In celebration, a large new exhibition has been unveiled at EPCOT, allowing fans a chance to get up close and personal with The Lion King's puppet-making process, Aladdin's costume fabrication, and a variety of special items from Frozen, Tarzan, Newsies, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aida, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Never to do something halfway, Disney World also has an exclusive-to-Disney Cirque du Soleil show called Drawn to Life (which highlights the importance of imagination), and the Disney on Broadway concert series, which brings Disney Theatricals stars back to the stage for limited concert runs.\n\nThis year, the Disney on Broadway concert series includes Patti Murin (Frozen) and John Riddle (Frozen), who are performing together January 23, 25, 27, and 28; Caissie Levy (Frozen) and Jelani Remy (The Lion King), who are performing together January 22, 24, 26, 29, and 30; Adam Jacobs (Aladdin) and Josh Strickland (Tarzan), who are performing together January 31, February 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 11; Ashley Brown (Mary Poppins) and Alton Fitzgerald White (The Lion King), who are performing together February 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 13; Michael James Scott (Aladdin) and Kissy Simmons (The Lion King), who are performing together February 14, 16, 17, 20, and 23; and Rodney Ingram (Aladdin) and Kara Lindsay (Newsies), who will be performing together February 15, 18, 19, 21, and 22. Additionally, there will be a special final performance featuring Ingram, Lindsay, Scott, and Simmons February 24.\n\nIn celebration, Playbill checked in with a handful of Disney on Broadway vets to learn about their formative Mouse memories, what makes Disney Theatricals different from any other Broadway producer, and to get their top tips for any theatre fans visiting the parks for the Festival of the Arts.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael James Scott (The Genie, Aladdin)\n\nDo you remember the first piece of art produced by Disney that moved you as a child?\n\nMy mom would put on Winnie the Pooh when I was a kid, and I would just be enamored. That was my entryway into Disney and into what the art of animation can do. Winnie the Pooh is really what started it all for me.\n\nWhat is different about working for Disney Theatricals than any other Broadway producer?\n\nThere really is such a thing as Disney magic. You can't even really describe it, but there is a special energy shift that you feel when you are working with this company. The producers, the creative teams, the leadership, the whole team have all been so, so good to me, and working with them always feels like home. It's always felt like such a beautiful, safe place to just be me, where I can be the artist that I am, and do my thing on so many levels, beautifully.\n\nIf someone is visiting Disney World for the first time to experience the Festival, what should they make sure to do while in the parks?\n\nOh, you've gotta do Pandora! The Avatar ride. It is such a good example of what Disney does when creating the world of a story. From the foundation up, they think of everything. Pandora is like going into a whole new world, the music, the story, the smells, the sights, what you're feeling, the emotion, it is just incredible.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaissie Levy (Elsa, Frozen)\n\nDo you remember the first piece of art produced by Disney that moved you as a child?\n\nFor me, it was Belle in Beauty and the Beast. It was the first show I did at summer camp, I was nine years old, and I played Belle, and it was what made me say \"theatre is it for me.\" I just loved that she was this bookish princess, and I love the message of Beauty and the Beast. But also The Little Mermaid and Ariel, that was the first Disney movie I saw in the movie theatres, and I was just blown away.\n\nWhat is different about working for Disney Theatricals than any other Broadway producer?\n\nDisney is truly like a family. They treat you so beautifully, they want to hear from you in the process. Especially when I was creating Elsa on Broadway, both Patti and I got to voice our thoughts about these women and have our voices and opinions heard. And that's something we never took for granted. And then, once you're in the family, you're in for life. It's such an honor to come back again and again.\n\nIf someone is visiting Disney World for the first time to experience the Festival, what should they make sure to do while in the parks?\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy! I feel like I'm flying on that ride, and I just can't wipe a smile off my face. It's like pure joy. It's exhilarating. I think it's perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\nJelani Remy (Simba, The Lion King)\n\nDo you remember the first piece of art produced by Disney that moved you as a child?\n\nSebastian the Crab [from The Little Mermaid]. My parents are Caribbean, and so Caribbean cultures were in the house, the music, the dialect. Sebastian was the first thing that sounded like my family. So I would imitate that, as a kid, because he sounded like my Grandpa. That representation was everything to me.\n\nWhat is different about working for Disney Theatricals than any other Broadway producer?\n\nI think that they just do an incredible job of magical care. There's just a magic to the care that they have with these shows, in bringing these iconic characters to life. And there's a certain level of beauty that's behind these shows, that is just so infectious. There's always something to see, if you see it more than once, you'll catch something else. There's such amazing detail in everything they do, and always something for everyone.\n\nIf someone is visiting Disney World for the first time to experience the Festival, what should they make sure to do while in the parks?\n\nI second Caissie 100 percent, I love Guardians of the Galaxy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatti Murin (Anna, Frozen)\n\nDo you remember the first piece of art produced by Disney that moved you as a child?\n\nSnow White! Which is fascinating now, because the original movies are so different from the animated movies that they have today. They're just not the same pacing. When I go to show my daughter, it just doesn't move her the same way it moved me. But when I was a kid, I just loved Snow White and her spirit. I wanted all of the animals to come to me!\n\nWhat is different about working for Disney Theatricals than any other Broadway producer?\n\nThey make it such a real family. Once you are in, they take you into the fold, and you are part of their family for life. Disney is one umbrella for all these different things\u2014the parks, the shows, the movies, the music\u2014but they're all connected through this family, and they take very, very, very good care of you. Even when your show closes, you are still a part of that.\n\nAll the people from the other shows, we all get to mingle, and we all know each other because we've done these things for Disney, all these special events that they do, and you have such an immediate bond with with anybody else who has worked for them. We're all Disney, and that means we are all connected\n\nIf someone is visiting Disney World for the first time to experience the Festival, what should they make sure to do while in the parks?\n\nI think everyone should make sure to go to the Magic Kingdom, and really spend time in the original park that was here. All the other ones are so fun, and it's amazing how they add rides, attractions, and shows as their catalog expands. But that original park, with the castle, is special. Walking in and seeing Main Street... I think nothing is better than that feeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Riddle (Hans, Frozen)\n\nDo you remember the first piece of art produced by Disney that moved you as a child?\n\nSomebody showed me Mary Poppins when I was little, and I was addicted. It was my entire personality growing up. But my other favorite was Sleeping Beauty. Every frame is a painting, I love watching that one, still.\n\nWhat is different about working for Disney Theatricals than any other Broadway producer?\n\nThere's something to how they can be a constant. When a new show comes to Broadway, it is sort of its own entity that lives for a moment in time and then goes into the ether of Broadway history after it closes, and everyone disperses. But when something is in the Disney canon, like Frozen, it never really goes away. This is a story that existed before we were there, but once we added our stamp onto it, we became a part of this whole thing, of what Frozen is moving forward under the Disney umbrella. There's something lasting about it in a different way. Like these concerts! Normally when you close a show, you put it in the mental filing cabinet, but this show keeps on living in new ways for me.\n\nIf someone is visiting Disney World for the first time to experience the Festival, what should they make sure to do while in the parks?\n\nThe fireworks at Magic Kingdom. I can't wait to take my three year old nephew, it's one of the most magical things I've ever seen. I mean come on, who doesn't love Tinkerbell?!\n\n",

Last week, the outlet also reported closures at the water park from Tuesday, Jan. 14, through Thursday, Jan. 16, as a result of another cold front.\n\nThe water park remains closed until Thursday, Jan. 23, according to Disney's official website. Disney World has another water park, Typhoon Lagoon, but it\u2019s currently shut down for the season.\n\nWhile most Disney resort pools are heated at 82 degrees all year round, it\u2019s possible that water parks could face closures if temperatures start dropping below 70 degrees, according to the official Disney resource for helpful tips, planDisney.\n\nCinderella Castle at Walt Disney World Resort.

It\u2019s important to bundle up while walking around outside, however indoor rides are regulated so temperatures could feel warmer.\n\nIt\u2019s best to opt for the many indoor attractions offered at the parks, as guests are especially susceptible to feeling cold and being exposed to winds in the open spaces at Animal Kingdom and Epcot, per unofficial Disney blog, WDW Magic.\n\nDespite having to bundle up for the cold, planDisney points out that guests may be able to take advantage of shorter wait times for rides as the resort tends to be slightly less crowded during this time.\n\nSnow falling down at the Florida Welcome Center.

However, some thought there could still be a chance.\n\nThe last time the Orlando area saw snow was in 1977 when snowfall accumulated to less than one inch.

            "content": "I\u2019ve been going to Disney World pretty consistently since I was a kid. In fact, my first trip to the parks actually happened when I was only 6 months old when my two newbie parents planned a vacation and essentially thought, \u201cWe have a kid now\u2026 so I guess we go to Disney World?\u201d\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve visited the parks dozens of times, both on vacations and as part of my job. I\u2019ve done all the rides, visited most of the Disney resort hotels, and taken in quite a bit of what Disney World has to offer. Still, this past year, I found myself doing a first at the Most Magical Place on Earth: I visited the parks while pregnant.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t planned to be that way\u2014my husband and I had planned out a winter Disney trip with our toddler and were surprised with a positive pregnancy test a few weeks in advance. But while I\u2019ll admit the thought of visiting Disney World while pregnant (especially in my first trimester) scared me, it ended up being one of the best trips we\u2019ve ever taken. Here\u2019s a bit of what I learned.\n\nDisney World Pregnant: What You Need to Know\n\nFirst and foremost, you may be wondering the obvious: Is there actually anything you can do at Disney World while pregnant? With tons of rides and attractions, you may worry there are limitations on what you\u2019ll actually be able to experience.\n\nThe truth is that there were really only a handful of rides that were off-limits specifically for pregnant people (think roller coasters and high-intensity motion simulators). While you\u2019re at the parks, you can go through the My Disney Experience app and select attractions, where you can filter by Expectant Mothers Advisory to see what is not recommended.\n\nNow, that being said, you should always speak with your doctor beforehand and consider your own limitations. For example, while Alien Swirling Saucers does not have an advisory, the spinning of the attraction would very much not have sat well with my stomach during pregnancy.\n\nMy Experience at Disney World Pregnant\n\nWhile unexpected, I really enjoyed our family trip to Disney World while I was pregnant. At the time, I was in my first trimester, so not yet showing or dealing with the physicality of a bump. I also managed to go right before the worst of my first trimester morning sickness and fatigue hit (for which I\u2019m eternally grateful). Because of that, I was still able to do quite a bit of what we had planned while leaning a bit more on my husband for helping with our toddler than I would have otherwise.\n\nThese were a few of the major pros and cons I personally experienced.\n\nThe Pros of Doing Disney World Pregnant\n\nThere is a LOT You Can Still Do\n\nOne of the most welcome surprises was realizing how much I could do while pregnant at the parks. While my beloved roller coasters were off limits, I found that just about everything my toddler wanted (and was able) to do in the parks was fine for me to go on as well. Frozen Ever After, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and Under the Sea \u2013 Journey of the Little Mermaid were all hits for her, and I was thankful to be able to experience her reaction for each and every one.\n\nOn top of that, we also took in some shows and entertainment\u2014things I\u2019ve found we don\u2019t always take the time to do when we\u2019re running from ride to ride.\n\nDisney World Attractions for Pregnant Moms\n\nHere\u2019s a full list of attractions without the advisory for pregnant people:\n\nMagic Kingdom\n\nAstro Orbiter\n\nBuzz Lightyear\u2019s Space Ranger Spin\n\nCountry Bear Musical Jamboree\n\nDumbo the Flying Elephant\n\nEnchanted Tales with Belle\n\nThe Hall of Presidents\n\nHaunted Mansion\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small world\u201d\n\nJungle Cruise\n\nLiberty Square Riverboat\n\nMad Tea Party\n\nThe Magic Carpets of Aladdin\n\nThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\n\nMickey\u2019s PhilharMagic\n\nPeter Pan\u2019s Flight\n\nPirates of the Caribbean\n\nPrince Charming Regal Carrousel\n\nSwiss Family Treehouse\n\nTom Sawyer Island\n\nTomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover\n\nUnder the Sea \u2013 Journey of the Little Mermaid\n\nWalt Disney World Railroad\n\nWalt Disney\u2019s Carousel of Progress\n\nWalt Disney\u2019s Enchanted Tiki Room\n\nEPCOT\n\nThe American Adventure\n\nAwesome Planet\n\nBeauty and the Beast Sing-Along\n\nCanada Far and Wide in Circle-Vision 360\n\nDisney and Pixar Short Film Festival\n\nFrozen Ever After\n\nGran Fiesta Tour Starring the Three Caballeros\n\nImpressions de France\n\nJourney Into Imagination with Figment\n\nJourney of Water, Inspired by Moana\n\nLiving with the Land\n\nMission: SPACE\n\nReflections of China\n\nRemy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure\n\nSeaBase Aquarium\n\nThe Seas with Nemo & Friends\n\nSoarin\u2019 Around the World\n\nSpaceship Earth\n\nTurtle Talk With Crush\n\nDisney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nAlien Swirling Saucers\n\nMickey & Minnie\u2019s Runaway Railway\n\nMuppet*Vision 3D\n\nToy Story Mania!\n\nVacation Fun \u2013 An Original Animated Short\n\nWalt Disney Presents\n\nDisney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nAffection Section\n\nAnimal Trails\n\nConservation Station\n\nIt\u2019s Tough to Be a Bug!\n\nNa\u2019vi River Journey\n\nWildlife Express Train\n\nYou Can Set Your Own Pace\n\nSpeaking of a slowed down pace, one of the added benefits of going to Disney World pregnant is I found my group naturally took on a more chilled pace than usual. While this may vary from group to group (we only had a toddler with us as opposed to a hyped-up older kid), my pregnancy made it so we took a little longer getting ready in the morning, not forcing us to wake up at the crack of dawn. We also took midday breaks and chose to stay out a little bit later instead.\n\nSetting the pace you\u2019re comfortable with while pregnant is key, whether that means taking it easy while others go on the rides or sleeping in a little bit in the morning to ensure you have energy through the day.\n\nA Welcome Distraction\n\nFirst trimester symptoms can be rough, and while I wasn\u2019t experiencing the worst of them yet, I was already dealing with a slight bit of nausea, headaches, and fatigue. While this made me worry about how I\u2019d be able to handle the parks, I honestly found that the vacation ended up being a welcome distraction. Instead of zeroing in on the symptoms (which is what I tend to do at home), I found that moving around and having my mind focused on being in Disney helped a lot with taking my mind off some of the more unpleasant things I was feeling.\n\nThe Cons of Going to Disney World While Pregnant\n\nCertain Rides Will Be Off Limits\n\nAs someone who has been to the parks multiple times, I wasn\u2019t particularly worried about missing out on any ride. However, if this is a once-in-a-lifetime trip for you, it can be disappointing to not be able to experience every ride.\n\nDisney World Attractions With Pregnancy Advisories\n\nWhile many options are still available for you, the following rides are not advised for expecting parents:\n\nMagic Kingdom\n\nThe Barnstormer\n\nBig Thunder Mountain Railroad (closed until 2026)\n\nSeven Dwarfs Mine Train\n\nSpace Mountain\n\nTiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure\n\nTomorrowland Speedway\n\nTRON Lightcycle / Run\n\nEPCOT\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind\n\nMission: SPACE\n\nTest Track\n\nDisney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nMillennium Falcon: Smugglers Run\n\nRock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster\n\nSlinky Dog Dash\n\nStar Wars: Rise of the Resistance\n\nStar Tours \u2013 The Adventures Continue\n\nThe Twilight Zone Tower of Terror\n\nDisney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nAvatar Flight of Passage\n\nDINOSAUR\n\nExpedition Everest \u2013 Legend of the Forbidden Mountain\n\nKali River Rapids\n\nKilimanjaro Safaris\n\nThe Weather (Depending)\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Disney World can get hot. From June through mid-October, the weather can be borderline unbearable with high temperatures and humidity you need to experience to believe. From experience, I know being pregnant in high temperatures can be miserable, and that can definitely affect your enjoyment of your trip.\n\nIf you are pregnant and visiting during the summer, you\u2019ll want to make sure to take extra precautions to stay cool, from spending time in air conditioning to using cooling towels and a fan when outdoors.\n\nIt Can Be Exhausting\n\nWhile setting your own pace is key to Disney World, especially while pregnant, there\u2019s no denying that it is a very physical and exhausting vacation. Going from place to place, you\u2019ll definitely get in your 10,000 steps per day (in fact, plan for quite a bit more), whether you\u2019re taking it slow or not.\n\nDepending what stage of pregnancy you\u2019re in, this is a consideration you\u2019ll definitely want to take into account when planning whether to take the trip or not.\n\nWould I Do It Again?\n\nYes, experiencing Disney World pregnant was tiring and made for a very different kind of trip. But would I do it again? Personally, I\u2019d say yes\u2014with a few notable caveats. If I were to plan a trip knowing I would be pregnant, I\u2019d shoot for the second trimester. While it\u2019s not always possible to plan these things out, I know for me the first trimester could\u2019ve made for a much more unpleasant trip if I\u2019d visited just a little while later once my symptoms had set in. And from a previous pregnancy, I know by the later stages of the third trimester, I\u2019d have been out of breath walking around the parks.\n\nI also would consider how often you plan on visiting Disney World with your family. If this were a once-in-a-lifetime trip, it may be worth holding off until you are able to go and experience everything Disney has to offer since some rides will be off limits.\n\nBest Advice If You\u2019re Going to Disney World While Pregnant\n\nBut if you are doing Disney World while pregnant, my biggest piece of advice would be this: don\u2019t panic. Immediately after realizing we\u2019d be visiting while expecting, I began Googling and seeing dozens of threads from people saying they had the worst time visiting while pregnant or recommending against going. And that, I would disagree with.\n\nWhile it\u2019s ultimately up to you and your specific situation, there is still plenty of fun to be had while visiting the parks\u2014especially if you have other kids you\u2019ll be taking along with you! Nothing could compete with getting to experience the joy in my daughter\u2019s eyes when we sailed past Anna singing Let It Go on Frozen Ever After or pointing out every Winnie the Pooh character on The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Sure, the trip was different than my other Disney trips, but overall, with a few changes, it will go down as one of my favorite trips to the park I\u2019ve ever taken.",

So with all the snow that fell in Florida, did it snow at Disney World?\n\nSnow, ice, sleet, and very cold temperatures hit across Florida, but especially North Florida. In Central Florida, where Disney World is located, no snow fell, but it has experienced frigid temperatures and rain.\n\nWhile many parts of the country experience cold temperatures, often below freezing during this time of the year, snow and temperatures as cold as what is being experienced in Florida are very uncommon. When snow hits Florida (which is super rare, but does happen once in a while), the ability to clear it in the way a northern state might isn\u2019t available, which makes it more dangerous to those living in the area.\n\nIn Disney World, the high temperature for January 22nd was 51 degrees while the low was 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The coldest \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature hit 27 degrees around 10 AM. Around 12:40 PM, the \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature was 34 degrees, making it a very cold day in Disney World. But not only is it a cold day in the parks, it has also been a rainy one. The frigid Florida temperatures mixed with the dampness of rain can really chill you to the bone if you\u2019re not properly dressed for the conditions.\n\nIf you are planning on visiting Disney World in the winter, we suggest packing warm layers that you can add or remove as needed depending on the weather. With the humidity in Florida, it can feel drastically colder than it really is, so packing appropriately for any kind of winter weather is a must!\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t snow in Disney World this time, snow does fall at the parks from time to time. It has been very cold and rainy in Central Florida, so make sure you\u2019re watching the weather as you begin packing for your next vacation so you can pack accordingly.\n\nFor more Disney news, keep following AllEars!\n\nJoin the AllEars.net Newsletter to stay on top of ALL the breaking Disney News!

Here's what to know.\n\nHas it ever snowed at Disney World?\n\nYes, it has snowed at Disney near Orlando.\n\nAccording to People Magazine, the Magic Kingdom theme park saw snow in January 1977.\n\nHas it ever snowed in Orlando, Florida?\n\nDid you know Disney World isn't technically in Orlando? It's outside of the city limits in a town called Bay Lake; however, its listed mailing address is in the adjacent town of Lake Buena Vista.\n\nSo has Disney's neighbor to the north gotten any snow?

Disney successfully justifies its pricing to consumers by emphasizing this unique experiential value.\n\nTiered Pricing Strategy\n\nWalt Disney adopts a tiered pricing strategy that offers various levels of pricing based on different consumer segments. This strategy is evident across its theme parks, where ticket prices vary depending on age groups (children, adults, seniors), peak versus off-peak seasons, and the types of experiences (one park versus park-hopper tickets).\n\nThis approach allows Disney to maximize attendance throughout the year by making it attractive for families, young adults, and various demographics, thus widening its target market.\n\nDisney\u2019s pricing strategy also extends to its accommodations. The company offers diverse lodging options ranging from budget-friendly value resorts to luxurious deluxe hotels catering to various income levels.

For example, the launch of a new film can be complemented by merchandise releases, theme park experiences, and various media ties.\n\nFor example, when \u201cFrozen\u201d debuted, it was not just a movie but an entire phenomenon. Disney marketed it through a strategic combination of merchandise sales, a theme park attraction that featured characters from the film, and a dedicated segment in their television programming.\n\nThis brand integration ensures that the promotional efforts drive engagement across all Disney platforms, creating a holistic experience for the consumer.

By reposting user-generated content, Disney amplifies engagement and creates a sense of belonging and community among its fans.\n\nExperiential Marketing\n\nDisney\u2019s promotional strategy is also heavily reliant on experiential marketing, which transforms the concept of a mere advertisement into an unforgettable experience. This includes the magical experiences created in Disney\u2019s theme parks, where immersive environments allow customers to engage with beloved stories and characters.\n\nThrough seasonal events like Halloween or Christmas celebrations, Disney enhances its appeal, offering unique experiences that promise to remain in visitors\u2019 memories for years to come.

Disney excels at creating narratives that resonate with audiences profoundly and emotionally. Disney tells stories that evoke happiness, adventure, nostalgia, and sometimes even sadness through its films, theme parks, and merchandise.\n\nThis strategy is key to building brand loyalty, as consumers are more likely to connect with a brand when it taps into their emotions. For example, iconic characters like Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, and Elsa aren\u2019t just characters; they\u2019re symbols of values such as kindness, bravery, and perseverance. Disney fosters an emotional connection between these characters and audiences by developing rich backgrounds and relatable stories.\n\n\n\nAlso, every Disney narrative is tied together by themes of hope and happiness, using the tagline \u201cHappily Ever After\u201d to reinforce positive outcomes.

Sponsoring school events, local parades, or holiday celebrations helps Disney position itself as a partner in the community rather than just a commercial entity.\n\nDisney also excels at using digital platforms to engage with communities worldwide. The YouTube channel, which features trailers, behind-the-scenes footage, and user-generated content, serves as a dynamic space where fans can connect with each other and with the brand. Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter/X inspire participation through challenges, hashtags, and giveaways, encouraging users to create and share their Disney experiences.\n\nThrough charitable donations, Disney further reinforces its community engagement.

By broadening representation and inclusivity in its content and campaigns, Disney increases its market potential and strengthens consumer loyalty and brand identity.\n\nDisney\u2019s mergers and acquisitions, such as Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, have allowed it to produce various franchises that appeal to different age groups, interests, and cultures.

Craft a compelling narrative that showcases how your products or services address customer pain points, aspirations, or dreams. Utilize various storytelling mediums, such as social media, blogs, or videos, ensuring consistent themes and character representation in your marketing.\n\nIn addition, consider using testimonials or case studies that highlight customer stories, positioning your audience as key characters in your brand narrative. This builds relatability and creates an emotional bond that can turn consumers into loyal advocates. By prioritizing emotional storytelling, you can transform your brand into a relatable and memorable presence, as Disney has done across generations.\n\nMaster the Art of Cross-Promotion Tactics\n\nDisney enhances brand visibility by integrating various products and experiences while generating additional revenue streams. Here are key tactics that businesses can draw from Disney\u2019s successful cross-promotion:\n\nUtilize Multi-Channel Engagement: Businesses should consider multichannel campaigns that connect products to an overarching story, ensuring that customers move fluidly from one medium to another;\n\nCollaborate with Complementary Brands: Disney frequently partners with brands that align with its image, such as the collaboration between Disney and LEGO for themed sets. Businesses can benefit from similar partnerships, aligning with other brands with a target audience, thus broadening reach and enhancing market presence through shared promotions;\n\nLeverage Iconic Characters and Themes: Your business can tap into consumers\u2019 emotional connections with certain themes or characters related to your market. This could involve using established imagery in advertising or creating limited-time offers that feature beloved characters or narratives;\n\nSeasonal and Event-Based Promotions: Businesses should regularly evaluate opportunities to create seasonal campaigns that relate to their products while incorporating relevant themes from popular culture to attract attention;\n\nCreate Exclusive Experiences: Creating exclusive events, limited-time offers, or immersive promotions helps to generate buzz and fosters a sense of urgency among consumers.\n\nLeverage Digital and Tech Innovations\n\nWalt Disney\u2019s marketing strategy has embraced digital and technological innovations, enabling the brand to maintain relevancy and enhance customer experiences. To effectively apply this aspect of Disney\u2019s plan to your own business, consider the following approaches:\n\nUtilize Augmented and Virtual Reality: Disney has successfully integrated AR and VR into its theme parks and media, creating immersive experiences that engage customers on a deeper level. Businesses should explore similar technologies to create unique product demonstrations or enhanced customer interactions that can differentiate them from competitors;\n\nImplement Data Analytics: Disney leverages big data to tailor its content and marketing strategies, gaining insights into customer preferences and behavior. Companies should invest in data analytics tools to track consumer trends, allowing them to personalize offerings and improve customer engagement;\n\nEnhance Online Presence Through Streaming: By developing streaming services or digital platforms tailored to your brand, you can ensure continuous customer engagement and create an additional revenue stream;\n\nOptimize Customer Experience with Mobile Technology: Disney\u2019s use of apps for park navigation, ticket purchasing, and queue management has streamlined the visitor experience. Businesses can follow suit by creating mobile apps that provide convenience and personalized services, making it easier for customers to interact with your brand.\n\nAdopt Experiential Marketing\n\nExperiential marketing goes beyond traditional advertising; it involves creating moments that allow consumers to interact with the brand meaningfully. Disney excels in this by transforming theme parks into living narratives where guests can become part of the story. For a business, this could translate into hosting events, workshops, or even branded installations that allow consumers to experience the product or service firsthand.\n\nTo adopt this strategy effectively, consider the following steps:\n\nUnderstand Your Audience: Just as Disney tailors experiences to different demographics \u2014 from thrill-seekers to families \u2014 businesses should research their target audience\u2019s interests, values, and preferences to craft relevant experiences;\n\nLeverage Storytelling: Use storytelling to create a cohesive experience that resonates emotionally;\n\nCreate Immersive Environments: Invest in environments that allow for active participation. This could mean interactive pop-up shops, virtual reality experiences, or exclusive previews that make customers feel part of something unique;\n\nEncourage Social Sharing: Design experiences that are not only enjoyable but also shareable. Disney parks integrate social media opportunities into attractions, capitalizing on user-generated content. Encourage attendees at your events to share their experiences online, amplifying reach through social channels;\n\nFollow-up: After an experiential event, maintain the connection. Gather feedback and offer incentives for future engagement, ensuring that the initial experience translates into long-term relationships.\n\nEngage in the Community\n\nBy actively participating in community initiatives, Disney strengthens its local ties and builds a positive brand image that resonates with its audience. Businesses can apply this aspect of Disney\u2019s strategy by identifying local causes and events that align with their brand values and mission.\n\nFor instance, Disney frequently supports educational programs, conservation efforts, and local health initiatives, demonstrating its commitment to community welfare. Companies can emulate this by sponsoring local events, volunteering, or collaborating with non-profit organizations that reflect their brand ethos. In addition, maintaining a presence at community events allows businesses to connect with customers authentically, creating a sense of belonging and shared purpose.\n\nLeveraging social media to promote these initiatives amplifies their impact, allowing customers to engage with the brand on a deeper level. Sharing stories and updates about community involvement enhances brand reputation and invites customer participation \u2013 turning casual consumers into dedicated brand advocates.\n\nUltimately, engaging with the community reinforces brand loyalty while providing businesses valuable insights into consumer preferences and local needs, mirroring Disney\u2019s holistic approach to customer engagement.\n\nTarget Diverse Demographics\n\nWalt Disney has long been recognized for its ability to engage a wide range of demographics, which is fundamental to its marketing strategy. This inclusivity is pivotal in fostering brand loyalty and expanding market reach. To effectively apply this approach to your business, consider the following methods:\n\nInclusive Content Creation: Disney produces content that reflects diverse cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. Your business can emulate this by creating marketing materials and content that resonate across cultural lines;\n\nSegmented Marketing Campaigns: Whether family-oriented ads during holiday seasons or highlighting LGBTQ+ themes during Pride Month, laser-focused marketing ensures messaging resonates with particular groups. Your business can use data analytics to identify distinct audience segments and craft campaigns addressing each group\u2019s unique needs and values;\n\nCommunity Engagement and Representation: Disney actively engages with various communities, enhancing brand perception and trust. Businesses should seek to embed themselves within local and diverse communities through partnerships, sponsorships, or purpose-driven initiatives that resonate with potential consumers;\n\nProduct Diversification: Disney\u2019s product lines, from merchandise to theme park experiences, reflect a mix that appeals to various demographics. To apply this, consider diversifying your product offerings or services to cater to multiple demographics, ensuring everyone sees something that connects to their identities or passions;\n\nCustomer Feedback Mechanisms: Disney continually refines its strategies using feedback from a multitude of audience voices. It utilizes surveys, social media interactions, and focus groups to gather insights from diverse consumer segments. This feedback improves products and services and communicates to your audience that their opinions are valued.\n\nConclusion\n\nWalt Disney\u2019s marketing strategy is a testament to brand storytelling, innovation, and an unwavering focus on customer experience. By tapping into its treasure chest of beloved characters and franchises, Disney builds strong emotional bonds with fans while unlocking endless ways to connect across movies, theme parks, merchandise, and more.\n\nDisney doesn\u2019t just stop at tradition \u2014 it embraces cutting-edge technology such as augmented reality and streaming services to stay ahead in a fast-changing world. Smart use of data also helps Disney craft marketing campaigns that speak directly to different groups of people, keeping everyone engaged.

            "content": "By Elliott Nace | Staff Writer\n\nDuring the first week of the 2025 Wintermester, the university held its inaugural \u201cLeadership and Innovation at Disney\u201d course, a philanthropy and public service credit that examines the company\u2019s business model through a weeklong trip to the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Fla. The course amplified students\u2019 study of the Walt Disney Company\u2019s leadership strategies through onsite interaction.\n\nThe PPS 1100 series, to which the course belongs, is a recent addition to the university course catalog, with each course focusing on a specific skill found in quality service. Dr. Jeremy Vickers, associate vice president of innovation and economic development, said the leadership course evolved into a joint venture with the Center for Global Engagement, and eventually Disney.\n\n\u201cThe topic of leadership and a travel component led us to, \u2018I wonder if we could make this work by studying one company in particular, one that\u2019s known for leadership and innovation and service, really, in a lot of ways.\u2019 And that was the Disney Company,\u201d Vickers said.\n\nVickers, who led the course\u2019s maiden voyage, said that while he had prior experience with Disney leadership programs at the university, they were characterized by lectures. Therefore, they lacked the academic structure needed to fully take advantage of the Disney setting.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have \u2014 and needed to have \u2014 a service learning component to [the course], where the students would have an opportunity to serve and consider the implications on community and public service,\u201d he said.\n\nIn order to better contextualize the company\u2019s high service standards, the course followed up with experiential visits to the Walt Disney World Resort with a volunteer opportunity at Give Kids the World Village, an Orlando-based nonprofit resort where \u201cchildren with critical illnesses and their families are treated to weeklong, cost-free vacations,\u201d according to their website.\n\nThese two exercises, alongside some literature assigned ahead of the trip, prepared students to then produce leadership training programs for nonprofits in the Waco area.\n\nStudents were given the chance to go on a backstage tour of Cirque du Soleil\u2019s and Disney\u2019s production, \u201cDrawn to Life,\u201d as well as meet Stephanie Young, president of the Disney Vacation Club and former president and managing director of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. However, they were equally encouraged to interact with cast members across the entire Walt Disney World Resort.\n\n\u201cThe experience that\u2019s provided is often in the hands of an hourly employee or volunteer,\u201d Vickers said. \u201cEvery individual member of a team is able to be innovative and creative, and I think we saw that up and down.\u201d\n\nThe course\u2019s structure sought to introduce students to examples of leadership ranging from the large scale of an entertainment destination to the merits of a single employee. Jennifer Cook, a study abroad program adviser at the Center for Global Engagement, said while leading the trip she observed that students first picked up on leadership skills while interacting with the Disney parks.\n\n\u201cDisney does a really good job of, even if you don\u2019t have someone from Disney there in front of you explaining what you\u2019re seeing, that there are things that are very intentional about the parks,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s design, whether it\u2019s interaction, whether it\u2019s visual, your senses are being stimulated all the time.\u201d\n\nDue to a short time frame for advertising, only 10 students registered for the course. However, its contents will benefit as interest and attendance grow in the near future. The course can begin to offer an in-house leadership seminar run by Disney Institute, the company\u2019s professional development division, as more students enroll.\n\n\u201cI think next time, given we pulled this off really quickly, having more lead time, having 15 or more students, having that Disney-led training experience workshop, to me, would be just one notch up,\u201d Vickers said.\n\nAn uptick in course attendance will allow for further use of in-house Disney leadership resources and therefore remove the need for a nonstop itinerary within the theme parks, Cook said.\n\n\u201cI think having more students go on the program will increase our likelihood of having more Disney-integrated content with park time because we definitely did not want to have this really strict schedule while in the parks, \u201d Cook said.\n\nThe course represents a new kind of offering from the Center for Global Engagement, in that it gives students of all academic backgrounds an experiential learning opportunity with a domestic company known for its efficiency and innovation. Its practicality and incorporation of volunteer service complement the mission of Baylor\u2019s PPS program, which, according to the university website, seeks \u201cto enrich the intellectual, social, and moral lives of undergraduate students.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this course is an opportunity to further translate some of the things that you\u2019re experiencing throughout your undergrad experience,\u201d Vickers said. \u201cFrom a Disney leadership model to what I would call \u2018Christian servant leadership,\u2019 which is what we espouse as a Christian institution, I think there\u2019s a lot of commonality [with Disney], even though it\u2019s a secular organization.\u201d",

            "content": "Walt Disney's DIS short percent of float has fallen 6.09% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 19.55 million shares sold short, which is 1.08% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.37 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nWalt Disney Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Walt Disney has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing Walt Disney's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Walt Disney's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 8.08%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

            "content": "Packing for any vacation can be stressful, but packing the essentials for a Disney vacation is a whole different ball game. Not only do you need to bring your vacation must-haves (a swimsuit and cute outfits are a must), but you also need to plan for spending a lot of time walking out and about in sunny Florida.\n\nI\u2019ve been to Disney World dozens of times for my job (and because I\u2019m a cheesy Disney adult), and one of the surprises I\u2019ve heard from first-time visitors is how much walking they do. A day in the Disney parks can easily involve 10+ miles of walking, mostly done in the hot Florida sunshine.\n\nAnd because you\u2019re spending so much time in the parks, it\u2019s incredibly important that you are packing the right things to help make your time in Disney World as stress-free as possible. Whenever anyone asks me what I pack with me in my park bag, these are the eleven Disney essentials I tell them I couldn\u2019t live without.\n\nDisney packing list essentials to never go without\n\n1. A comfortable bag to carry everything\n\nFirst and foremost on your Disney essentials packing list, you need to think about the bag you\u2019ll bring. If you are a highly organized minimalist, you may be able to get away with something like the lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag to keep your hands free. However, I am not that person, and I always need something a bit bigger to carry all my essentials.\n\nI like to opt for a bigger backpack to keep me organized, like Colugo\u2019s The Parent Backpack. With multiple compartments, I can pack everything I need into it without feeling weighed down throughout the day. It\u2019s big enough to carry what I need but not so big that I feel like I\u2019m going on an expedition up a mountain.\n\n2. A portable charger\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been to Disney World in the past decade, you may be shocked to learn how much you need to use your phone to get around now. From picking your next Disney Genie+ selection to mobile ordering, you will find that you are constantly on your phone within the parks.\n\nWith that in mind, bringing a portable charger with you is incredibly important. Your phone will run out of battery quicker than you realize, so avoid having to walk around with a dead phone for most of the day by bringing a portable battery with you.\n\nAlternatively, you will also have the option to use FuelRods in the park. There are multiple FuelRod stations at both the parks and in the hotels that allow you to purchase a portable FuelRod charger for $30.\n\nThe benefit here is that you can simply switch out your maxed-out charger for a new one any time you need it, so you never have to worry about your portable battery running out. If you do choose this option, I recommend buying a FuelRod in advance on Amazon and then switching it out when you need it in the parks.\n\n3. Comfortable sneakers\n\nOn my list of Disney essentials, this is number one. Whenever you reach the end of the night at Disney World, you\u2019ll spot different types of people. There are the tired parents, the melting-down children, and the people who clearly wore the wrong shoes to the park.\n\nWhile it can be tempting to wear a brand new pair of shoes to the park, I urge you to break in a comfortable pair of sneakers well before you enter the Most Magical Place on Earth. My personal pick has always been the Reebok Club C 85, which are incredibly comfortable and never give me blisters\u2014but choose whichever shoes will be best for you when walking several miles.\n\n4. Sunscreen\n\nAlong with the Central Florida heat comes the strong Florida sunshine. Wearing sunscreen is absolutely essential to keep your skin safe from getting burned. I like to bring along a joint face and body sunscreen that\u2019s easy to reapply throughout the day (because believe me, you\u2019ll sweat the first application off in no time). I also love the Supergoop (Re)Setting Refreshing Mist with SPF 40 to give my face a refreshing spritz throughout the day, with the added benefit of sun protection.\n\n5. Sunglasses\n\nSpeaking of the sun, you will absolutely regret not bringing your favorite pair of sunglasses with you. For the longest time, I wondered who in the world was purchasing sunglasses from the Sunglass Hut in Adventureland at Magic Kingdom\u2014that is, until the day I forgot to bring a pair with me. Over $150 unexpectedly spent later, I am the proud owner of a pair of Ray-Bans that I picked up as an impulse purchase in the parks.\n\n6. A cooling towel or fan for the Florida heat\n\nThe first time I went to Disney World as an adult, I saw dozens of other guests with cooling towels and wearable neck fans and thought, \u201cthat will never be me.\u201d By the next visit, I had changed my tune.\n\nAfter hours of being in the park and getting hot and tired, you will begin to care quite a bit less about what you look like. Things like a portable neck fan or cooling neck towel make a world of difference in helping to cool down when it feels unbearably hot. If you have a kid with you in a stroller, a stroller fan is also tremendously helpful.\n\n7. Chafing-prevention products\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes I ever made in Disney World was not preparing for chafing. It\u2019s a subject no one really wants to talk about, but it\u2019s a harsh reality when you\u2019re dealing with a combination of shorts, sweat, and unbelievably hot weather.\n\nI swear by the Megababe Thigh Rescue, which is a deodorant-like stick that can be applied on your inner thighs to prevent chafing. When I\u2019m wearing a dress or skirt in the park, I also always wear a simple pair of biker shorts underneath to prevent friction.\n\n8. A reusable water bottle\n\nInstead of spending a ton of money on water in the parks, bring along a collapsible water bottle with you to stay hydrated. Around the parks, you\u2019ll find a ton of different water bottle refill stations where you can easily fill up your bottle of water throughout the day.\n\nYou\u2019ll be shocked at how much money you end up saving. In addition to saving money on Disney food, staying hydrated is crucial for a comfortable day at the parks.\n\n9. Rain gear\n\nWhenever it rains in Disney World (which happens more often than not), you\u2019ll see a mass of people running to the outdoor carts to pick up a poncho. Avoid spending the upcharge and bring a poncho or rain jacket along with you.\n\nI love to order a poncho pack beforehand, with a multi-pack often costing the same amount as one poncho bought in the parks. Including rain gear in your ultimate Disney packing list ensures you are prepared for any weather conditions.\n\n10. Ways to keep kids entertained in line\n\nWhile this list is not specific to just parents, if you are bringing kids to the park with you then it\u2019s never a bad idea to bring a few travel-friendly ways to keep them entertained in longer ride lines. If you have older kids, interactive games on the phone like Heads Up are an entertaining way to spend some time. For younger kids, I love to bring things like a coloring book, or a magnetic puzzle and Tic-Tac-Toe that they can use in line and then easily pack away in your bag.\n\n11. Hand sanitizer and hand wipes\n\nHand sanitizer. That\u2019s all. But for real, you will want to bring hand sanitizer and antibacterial hand wipes for your own personal sanity. Disney does a great job of keeping things nice and clean, but this is a park with thousands of visitors a day, so it\u2019s never a bad idea to bring a travel-size sanitizer to use throughout the day. For a bit of extra fun and organization in your bag, you can keep everything in a cute cosmetics case.\n\nDisney-Specific Items\n\nWhen packing for your Disney trip, there are some Disney-specific items you should consider bringing. Here are a few:\n\nDisney Parks App and Technology\n\nThe official Disney Parks app is an absolute game-changer for any Disney trip. This handy app lets you check wait times, make dining reservations, and even order food and drinks right from your phone. It\u2019s also your go-to tool for navigating the parks, finding attractions, and keeping track of entertainment schedules. Make sure to download the app before your trip and spend some time getting familiar with its features.\n\nGiven how much you\u2019ll be using your phone, a portable charger is a must-have to keep your device powered throughout the day. Additionally, bringing a pair of earbuds or headphones can enhance your experience, allowing you to enjoy the park\u2019s music and sounds without any distractions.\n\nBy following these tips and packing the right essentials, you\u2019ll be well-prepared for a magical and stress-free Disney World adventure. Happy planning!\n\nWhat you don\u2019t need to bring to Disney World\n\nAlong with the essentials, there are a few products you absolutely do not need to bring with you. The first may surprise you, and that\u2019s bug repellent!\n\nOne of the truly \u201cmagical\u201d parts of Disney World is the lack of bugs you\u2019ll find throughout the resort\u2014and there\u2019s a big reason for that. Disney uses various methods to keep mosquitos away, including flowing water and garlic spray (yes, really). So, while bringing your own bug spray with you is never a bad idea, it\u2019s not entirely necessary.\n\nFirst Aid basics are another typically essential item you don\u2019t need to bring with you to Disney World, and that\u2019s because they have everything you need complimentary. If you get a minor cut that needs a bandaid, or a headache that needs Tylenol, head over to a First Aid station.\n\nWith a location in each of the four theme parks and both water parks, these helpful stations provide over-the-counter medication, bandages, and other remedies for smaller issues. On-site nurses are also available in case you are in need of further assistance.\n\nAdditionally, these First Aid centers can store medication that requires refrigeration, which is something else to keep in mind when figuring out what you want to bring with you. If you are using rental cars, consider travel accessories like Apple AirTags to keep track of your vehicle in busy parking lots.",

            "content": "Walt Disney World's biggest fans anticipate many changes at the resort in the new year. Disney Parks Blog, the official communications channel sharing official parks news and announcements, recently provided new details about additions coming to Walt Disney World in 2025. Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D'Amaro unveiled many of these changes earlier this year at D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event in Anaheim, California.\n\nThese changes come on the heels of a busy past few years. Since 2022, Walt Disney World opened headliner attractions such as Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, TRON Lightcycle/Run, and Tiana's Bayou Adventure. While this year does not include any new land or ride openings, multiple smaller-scale but highly anticipated projects will keep fans busy.\n\nTravel experts who love the Disney World theme park as much as any other fan highlight the changes in 2025 they look forward to the most. When planning a vacation to Disney World in the new year, keeping these opening timelines in mind will help families experience the latest offerings. Travelers must also consider upcoming ride closures as Disney World prepares for major multi-year projects beginning in 2025.\n\nAttraction Closures and Openings\n\nThis year marks the beginning of significant changes at the Walt Disney World theme parks. At Magic Kingdom, the Liberty Square Riverboat and Rivers of America section of Frontierland will permanently close to make way for a new area inspired by the Pixar Cars franchise. Officials have yet to announce an exact timeline for when these changes will commence in 2025.\n\nOver in Disney's Animal Kingdom, DinoLand U.S.A. heads towards extinction in the new year. Several of the land's rides will close in January, with the land closing in phases to make way for a new land inspired by what Disney Imagineers dub the Tropical Americas \u2013 Central and South America featuring Encanto and Indiana Jones. DinoLand's flagship attraction, DINOSAUR, will remain open throughout 2025 before its permanent closure at some point in 2026. The Tropical Americas land opens in 2027.\n\nTest Track, a popular thrill ride at EPCOT, closed last summer to make way for a new version, reopening in late summer. This third iteration of the attraction features an all-new storyline and integrates man's journey with motion into new show scenes.\n\nGavin Doyle, founder of Mickey Visit and best-selling author of Disneyland Secrets, highlights how the new version of Test Track strengthens EPCOT's ride offerings. \"That is a super fun ride system, so it will be exciting to see what new story they can introduce there. I am pleased that the ride is closed for over a year because that signals they are doing some real work to improve this attraction.\"\n\nNew Entertainment and Dining\n\nFor fans of Walt Disney World's parades and entertainment, 2025 marks a period of exciting changes. For the first time in years, guests at the Magic Kingdom will see a nighttime parade making its way down Main Street, U.S.A. The parade, called Disney Starlight: Dream the Night Away, debuts in the summer. The parade features floats inspired by Disney animated films such as Moana, Peter Pan, Frozen, and Pinocchio.\n\nTheme park journalist Megan duBois highlights Disney Starlight as the number one thing she looks forward to the most at Disney World for 2025. \"The concept art reminds me of the nighttime parade at Tokyo Disneyland, which is so cute,\" says duBois. She notes the lengthy hiatus between nighttime parades performing at Magic Kingdom emphasizes how dramatically the evening environment will change in the park once Disney Starlight debuts.\n\nParades and special Disney firework shows draw a crowd to the Disney theme parks as one of the most popular entertainment offerings. In many fans' eyes, Disney Starlight's debut eclipses the excitement felt when a new ride opens.\n\n\"Though there is no huge new ride opening at Walt Disney World in 2025, there are quite a few big additions that I am excited about,\" says Doyle. \"The new nighttime parade will be a ton of fun. I was thrilled to hear them announce this.\"\n\nIn addition to the parade, a brand-new stage show, Disney Villains Unfairly Ever After, will premiere at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the summer. The show features a cast of popular villains from Disney animated films, including Cruella de Vil, Captain Hook, and Maleficent.\n\nTwo new lounge spaces serving food and drinks will also welcome its first guests at Walt Disney World in 2025. Spaceship Earth Lounge, inspired by the flagship EPCOT attraction, opens in late spring. The second lounge, themed after the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction in Magic Kingdom, will open in late 2025.",

It is built on the work of Walt Disney, a revolutionary entertainer and cartoon innovator, and is now a multinational conglomerate of entertainment venues, channels, and brands.

            "content": "With the worldwide box office for its animated Polynesian fantasy adventure Moana 2 having sailed north of $1 billion, the Walt Disney Company is now facing a lawsuit alleging copyright theft against the franchise. The lawsuit was filed on January 10 in California federal court.\n\nThe plaintiff, artist Buck Woodall, resident of Baja, Mexico, and Taos New Mexico, outlined his case in a 33-page lawsuit, arguing that there was a \u201cconcerted and highly orchestrated action among the Defendants [which] constitutes a civil conspiracy to inflict deliberate harm upon Woodall, according to proof.\u201d\n\nWoodall\u2019s claim is based on a screenplay for a Hawaiian-themed animated feature, titled Bucky (pictured top, left), and his pitch document, with treatments, color illustrations, character breakdowns, and sketches, registered with United States Patent and Trademark Office in 2004 and 2014. Woodall previously attempted to sue Disney for copyright infringement, but the earlier case was dismissed because the lawsuit was filed too late after the release of Disney\u2019s original 2016 film Moana.\n\nThe new claim asserts that former Mandeville Films director of development Jenny Marchick, now DreamWorks Animation\u2019s head of development for features, had access to Woodall\u2019s material while maintaining offices on the Disney lot in Burbank, and she shared Woodall\u2019s copyrighted material as part of a first-look deal with Disney, prior to development of Moana. Marchick, according to Woodall, \u201cmasterminded\u201d a two-decade-long scheme \u201cto support her thirst to gain success in her desired career in the movie industry, at all costs.\u201d\n\nIn the earlier lawsuit, Moana co-director Ron Clements, who is also credited with Moana\u2019s story, along with six other writers, provided a statement to the court, \u201cMoana was not inspired by or based in any way on [Woodall] or his Bucky project, which I learned of for the first time after this lawsuit was filed.\u201d\n\nWoodall\u2019s new lawsuit maintains, \u201cThis project was inspired by Woodall\u2019s unique exposure to Polynesian culture \u2014 including living on Hanalei Bay for approximately a decade \u2014 as well as his expenditure of more than $500,000.00 in personally creating, writing and developing a theatrical motion picture package associated with Bucky.\u201d\n\nClauses describe similarities between Bucky and Moana. These include: a rebellious teenage protagonist in an oceanside Polynesian village, a sea voyage that leads to cultural awakening, animal spirit guides, an aerial opening scene, introduction of the protagonist as an infant, a turtle, a \u201csymbolic necklace,\u201d navigation by the stars, a goddess that emanates from volcanic lava, a demigod with tattoos introduced in a cave, a whirlpool scene, a giant creature conceals itself as a mountain. And in Moana 2: time travel, shape-shifting, surfing imagery and other details.\n\nThe suit closes by demanding compensatory damages of either 2.5 percent of Moana\u2019s gross revenue, or at least $10 billion.",

A no-nonsense guide to Disney World's Lightning Lane passes\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption US Disney parks debut new Lightning Lane experience A new pass lets Disney guests skip lines more easily at the parks, but it's not cheap.\n\nWalt Disney World visitors can choose to pay for shorter lines through Lightning Lanes or wait in longer standby lines for free.\n\nThree Lightning Lane options are available: Single Passes for specific popular rides, Multi Passes for reservations at most other rides, and Premier Passes for on-demand access to all Lightning Lanes within a park.\n\nWhile Lightning Lanes can significantly reduce wait times, especially during peak seasons, free strategies like rope dropping, staying until park closing, and using single-rider lines can also be effective.\n\nAnyone visiting Walt Disney World has a decision to make: Do you pay for shorter lines or wait with the masses?\n\nYou will pay either way, with time or money.\n\nTo save time, guests can buy passes for expedited queues, known as Lightning Lanes. There are three passes to choose from \u2013 Single, Multi and Premier \u2013 and several factors to consider when deciding on the right one for you, if you pick one at all.\n\nPreviously, only Disney World resort hotel guests and guests of other select hotels could purchase the Premier Pass, but eligibility opened up to everyone on Jan. 21.\n\n(Disneyland in California also has Lightning Lane Passes, but they operate slightly differently.)\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about Lightning Lanes at Disney World.\n\nHow does a Lightning Lane work?\n\nA Lightning Lane is an express lane. You still have to wait your turn, but the queue is shorter and faster than regular lines open to everyone.\n\nAt Disney World, most rides and some shows have a Lightning Lane.\n\nDifferent types of passes allow access to different attractions' Lighting Lanes. Only the Premier Pass provides access to every Lightning Lane within a park.\n\nSingle and Multi Passes have specific, hourlong return windows for guests to experience attractions. Premier Passes allow you to visit attractions on demand, whenever you\u2019d like on your pass day.\n\nNo matter which pass you buy, you can only use it once at each attraction. If you want to experience the attraction again, you\u2019ll have to wait in the regular line.\n\nLightning Lane Multi Pass and Lightning Lane Premier Pass come with digital downloads of select attraction photos.\n\nAll three Lightning Lane passes are purchased and managed through Disney World\u2019s free My Disney Experience app.\n\nWhat is a Lightning Lane Single Pass?\n\nLightning Lane Single Passes are attraction-specific, \u00e0 la carte passes for the most popular rides in each park.\n\n\u25fe Magic Kingdom: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, TRON Lightcycle / Run.\n\n\u25fe EPCOT: Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind.\n\n\u25fe Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios: Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance.\n\n\u25fe Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom: Avatar Flight of Passage.\n\nGuests may purchase up to two Lightning Lane Single Passes per person, per day.\n\nWhat is a Lightning Lane Multi Pass?\n\nLighting Lane Multi Pass is a reservation tool for all the other attractions with Lightning Lanes, except Single Pass attractions. (It\u2019s a hybrid of Genie+, which Multi Pass replaced last summer, and Fast Passes, which went away with the pandemic.)\n\nThe passes are priced by park. Guests with Park Hopper tickets buy Multi Passes for whichever park they\u2019re starting at on a given day. You may hold up to three attraction reservations at a time and can book your first three ahead of your visit.\n\nFor Animal Kingdom, guests may prebook any three Lightning Lane attractions except Avatar Flight of Passage because Single-Pass attractions are not included with Multi Pass.\n\nFor Magic Kingdom, EPCOT and Hollywood Studios, guests have two buckets of attractions to choose from during their advance booking window. Let\u2019s call the first bucket Group A. These are some of the most in-demand attractions in each park, aside from the Single-Pass ones which are excluded. Everything else falls in Group B, which also has some very popular rides, like Haunted Mansion in Magic Kingdom and The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Hollywood Studios. You can prebook one Group A attraction and two Group B attractions. Or you can choose three Group B attractions and nothing from Group A. You just can\u2019t reserve multiple Group A attractions before your park visit.\n\nWhichever attractions you choose, make sure your first Lightning Lane reservation is early in your park day because once you use it, you no longer need to worry about what\u2019s in Group A or Group B. At this point, you could also dump your remaining reservations and book all Group A attractions instead, if desired and available. Guests with Park Hopper tickets may also book attractions in other parks after they\u2019ve used their first Lightning Lane.\n\nEvery time you use a reservation, you may book a new one from the list of what\u2019s available. If the app says no times are available for a specific attraction, refresh or try again later. Availability changes as fellow guests change their plans.\n\nWhat is the difference between Lightning Lane Multi Pass and Lightning Lane Premier?\n\nThere are several key differences between Lightning Lane Multi Pass and Lightning Lane Premier. The most obvious are price and flexibility. Premier Passes cost much more because you\u2019re paying for the convenience of being able to use any Lightning Lane within a park on demand, without having to book times. This includes Single Pass attractions. Just show up.\n\nYou\u2019re still limited to one-time use at each attraction. You're also limited to the park you buy the Premier Pass for because, unlike the Multi Pass, you can\u2019t use your Premier Pass in other parks when park hopping, at least at present. The Premier Pass is still being piloted.\n\nHow much do Lightning Lane passes cost?\n\nLightning Lane Pass prices vary widely by type and date. Single Passes also vary by attraction while Multi Passes and Premier Passes vary by park. Prices are visible on Disney World\u2019s app several weeks out from the current date.\n\nThrough the end of January, Single Passes start at $11 for Snow Seven Dwarf\u2019s Mine Train, typically the least expensive Single Pass. Multi Passes start at $15 for Animal Kingdom, the least expensive park for Multi Passes and admission.\n\nHere are the starting prices for Premier Passes through the end of January:\n\n\u25fe Disney's Animal Kingdom: $119\n\n\u25fe EPCOT: $169\n\n\u25fe Disney's Hollywood Studios: $269\n\n\u25fe Magic Kingdom: $329\n\n(Story continues below)\n\nWhen can you buy Lightning Lane passes?\n\nGuests staying at Disney Resorts Collection hotels, Shades of Green Resort, and Walt Disney World Dolphin, Swan and Swan Reserve may purchase Lightning Lane passes up to seven days ahead of their resort arrival day. They can purchase passes all at once for each day of their stay, up to 14 days.\n\nAll other guests may purchase Lightning Lane passes three days ahead of their park visit. Guests with date-based, multiday tickets may purchase all their passes at once, three days ahead of their first park day. Most tickets are date-based tickets.\n\nIs the Lightning Lane worth it?\n\nWorth it is subjective, but if your heart is set on a high-demand ride and a Single Pass is within your budget, it may be worth buying because waits for those rides regularly top an hour.\n\nAlso, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and Tiana's Bayou Adventure use a virtual queue instead of traditional stand-by lines. If you rely solely on the free virtual queue and don\u2019t snag a spot, you may not get to experience the ride at all during your visit.\n\nMulti Passes can be worth it, especially during busy times of the year at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios and Magic Kingdom, the most visited theme park in the world. They can also be helpful at EPCOT if Frozen Ever After and Remy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure are high on your to-do list. Both of those lines get very long. The same goes for Test Track, but that's closed for reimagining until late summer. Depending on the time of day, Soarin\u2019 Around the World waits aren\u2019t too bad for a Group-A level attraction. Other ride queues move pretty quickly in EPCOT.\n\nMulti Passes aren\u2019t really needed for Animal Kingdom if you rope drop \u2013 which is getting to the park before it opens so you can be among the first guests inside \u2013 or stay until the park closes after a lot of families head home in the afternoon. But the passes can still save time on popular attractions like Kilimanjaro Safaris, which may make them worth it to you.\n\nLightning Lane Premier Passes are not needed. They are more of a want than a need. If you can easily afford them and they will make your trip easier, they may be worth it to you, but you can absolutely enjoy a full park day with the other types of passes or no passes at all.\n\nDisney World crowd calendar: The cheapest and least crowded times to visit in 2025\n\nHow to save time in line at Disney World\n\nThere are several ways to save time without Lighting Lanes.\n\n\u25fe Rope drop to be among the first people in the parks.\n\n\u25fe Stay until park closing, after other guests have left.\n\n\u25fe If rides are your priority, go during parades and nighttime spectaculars.\n\n\u25fe Use single-rider lines where available, but know that your party will be split up.\n\n\u25fe Use Disney World\u2019s app to check wait times and strategize accordingly.\n\n\u25fe Take advantage of extra park time if you\u2019re staying on the property. Guests staying at Disney resorts get 30 minutes of Early Theme Park Entry. Deluxe resort guests also get Extended Evening Hours at certain parks on select nights.\n\n\u25fe Visit during traditionally less crowded times of the year, like most of September.\n\n\u25fe Consider an after-hours event instead of a regular park day. After-hours events typically have much shorter lines for rides, though waits for rare character meet-and-greets can be lengthy.\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)",

It set myriad other records at the time of release and continued riding a wave throughout the holidays.\n\nIt also helped Disney become the only studio of 2024 to top $5B in worldwide box office, the first time that any studio has surpassed the five-century mark since 2019.\n\nMoana 2 is the 2nd highest grossing animated release of all time in Brazil and France, and the highest grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios release ever in France, Australia, Brazil and Mexico as well as across the Latin American region, Greece, Slovakia, South Africa, Turkey, UAE, New Zealand, Peru, Chile, Central America, Ecuador, Bolivia and Uruguay.\n\nThe Top 5 international markets to date are: France ($61.2M), UK ($50.5M), Germany ($43.1M), Australia ($30.9M) and Japan ($30.7M).",

            "content": "Nearly two months after earning the biggest Thanksgiving opening weekend in box office history, Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana 2\u201d has passed $1 billion at the global box office.\n\nThe sequel added $13.9 million worldwide this weekend to pass the mark, joining \u201cZootopia\u201d and the two \u201cFrozen\u201d films as the fourth film from Walt Disney Animation to pass the ten-digit milestone. All three of the 2024 releases to hit $1 billion came from Disney, with \u201cMoana 2\u201d joining Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d \u2014 the highest grossing animated film of all time \u2014 Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the highest grossing R-rated film of all time.\n\nOver the past decade, Disney has used Thanksgiving weekend as a launch pad for Walt Disney Animation titles, but suffered two high profile busts in recent years from that release window with \u201cStrange World\u201d and \u201cWish.\u201d In February of last year, CEO Bob Iger, as part of a studio-wide pivot towards sequels, announced that a long-developing \u201cMoana\u201d streaming series for Disney+ was being redesigned into a theatrical sequel that would take the Thanksgiving 2024 slot.\n\nWhile the first \u201cMoana\u201d was a solid theatrical success with $643 million grossed worldwide, the launch of Disney+ in 2019 and the subsequent COVID-, 19 pandemic turned the film into the most watched title on the streaming service. With years of hype built from its success on the home platform, \u201cMoana 2\u201d exploded into theaters with a 5-day Thanksgiving domestic opening of $225.4 million, a full $100 million more than what \u201cFrozen II\u201d made in the holiday period five years prior.\n\nWith the presence of other well-received family films in the Christmas corridor like Universal\u2019s \u201cWicked,\u201d Paramount\u2019s \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d and Disney\u2019s own \u201cMufasa,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d didn\u2019t have as strong legs through December as \u201cInside Out 2\u201d did over the summer. But it has still done enough to join the $1 billion club, making it the 32nd film in Disney\u2019s filmography to do so.\n\nDisney may have to wait a while for its next $1 billion hit, but it has two strong chances to hit that mark at the end of the year. Next Thanksgiving will see the release of \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d followed by the third installment of James Cameron\u2019s wildly popular \u201cAvatar\u201d series.",

That way, you can be prepared for your next vacation. So, now that 2025 had begun, what did the average ride waits look like as Disney World settled into the winter? Should we be worried or relieved? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at this past week\u2019s average wait times.\n\nBelow is the average weekly wait time for each ride, from shortest to longest wait time.\n\nWait times at Magic Kingdom dipped back to \u201cnormal\u201d levels this week, though the park was still \u201cbusy.\u201d For example, TRON\u2019s wait time was still nearly 70 minutes\u2026 but was DOWN from 101 minutes.\n\n(REMINDER: Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure is currently only available with virtual queue and Lightning Lanes.)\n\nOver in Hollywood Studios, times saw a dip, but the order of rides remained status quo with Slinky Dog Dash, Rise of the Resistance, and Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster topping the chart.\n\nWith Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster\u2019s imminent closure due to the Muppets retheme (read all about that right here), we have to wonder how this will impact the other rides. It has been closed for refurbishment before, but this will likely be a longer closure than we\u2019re used to. Since it does post one of the highest wait times in the park, all of those people will be somewhere else in the park. That\u2019s just something to keep in mind when it does close, however, no date has been announced by Disney yet.\n\nThe wait times in EPCOT also dipped this week (one of the rare festival-free weeks of the park\u2019s calendar), with Remy\u2019s and Frozen being the only rides to top 40, or even 30 minutes.\n\n(NOTE: Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind does not currently use a standby queue, so it\u2019s not included here.)\n\nDisney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nAnimal Kingdom\u2019s Flight of Passage maintained its lead as the park\u2019s busiest ride, while TriceraTop Spin saw a longer-than-normal wait\u2026just before it closed forever! Kali River Rapids also closed for its annual maintenance.\n\nThat\u2019s it for wait time updates at Disney World for now!

The film, initially conceived as a series for Disney+, was turned into a feature flick after Bob Iger returned as CEO to the House of Mouse. It was released on November 28, 2024. After eight weeks in theaters, it has surpassed this milestone.\n\nOver the weekend, the film made $1.009 billion globally. The sequel has earned $445 million domestically and $567 million internationally. This marks the third film for The Walt Disney Company that entered the billion-dollar club. It follows Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine. Disney is the only studio that fielded billion-dollar movies in 2024. However, Universal\u2019s Despicable Me 4 came close and reached $964 million.\n\nMoana 2 has had a strong run since its opening weekend broke records Frozen II originally set. It made $225 million over the course of its opening five-day weekend. Frozen II previously held the record at $125 million. The success of Moana 2 is also greater than its predecessor. The original Moana made $680 at the global box office when it was released in 2016. The film went on to become one of the most streamed films on Disney+. The original is currently being remade as a live-action feature.\n\nAbout Moana 2\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\u2019 epic animated musical \u201cMoana 2\u201d reunites Moana (voice of Cravalho) and Maui (voice of Johnson) three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she\u2019s ever faced. Directed by David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller, and produced by Christina Chen and Yvett Merino, \u201cMoana 2\u201d features music by Grammy\u00ae winners Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear, Grammy nominee Opetaia Foa\u2018i, and three-time Grammy winner Mark Mancina. Jared Bush and Miller are writing the film, which is executive produced by Jennifer Lee, Bush and Johnson. The film also features returning stars Rachel House (Moana\u2019s Grandma, Tala), Temuera Morrison (Moana\u2019s father, Chief Tui) and Nicole Scherzinger (Moana\u2019s mother, Sina), as well as the voices of Hual\u0101lai Chung, David Fane and Rose Matafeo as Moana\u2019s new crew members Moni, Kele and Loto, respectively. Awhimai Fraser voices mysterious new character Matangi; Gerald Ramsey plays Moana\u2019s ancestor, Tautai Vasa; and Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda lends her voice to Moana\u2019s adoring and adorable little sister, Simea.\n\nHave you seen Moana 2 yet?

            "content": "Something's off at Walt Disney Imagineering\n\nThe Haunted Mansion at Disneyland reopened today after what amounts to a year-long refurbishment. It will be the first time guests have been able to experience the original Mansion since 2023, when it was transformed to the Nightmare Before Christmas for an increasingly lengthy stay.\n\nA brand-new queue and gift shop are part of the major changes. And it is the latter that has drawn the ire of theme park fans and, frankly, people with eyeballs, since it was first erected.\n\nThere's the unappealing, perhaps prefabricated design. There's how awkward it looks whether you're coming from Bayou Country or up from New Orleans Square. And then there's the interior, where art created by artificial intelligence was found wrecking these halls. It is, by no means, Imagineering's best work.\n\nAnd given the extreme lack of transparency, we don't know who to blame. That's become increasingly clear over the past decade of Imagineering. Rumors suggest projects are wildly over budget, with the see-saw between Business Interests and Creative Desires more lopsided than ever.\n\nBut we do know what we can see: There's something off at Walt Disney Imagineering. The recently opened Tiana's Bayou Adventure was always going to receive somewhat mixed reviews because it replaced a classic, albeit one with, ah, skeletons in its closet. And foyer. You get the idea. But recent hotel projects have also fallen short of what Disney fans expect from the luxury entertainment company. The same can be said of long-gestating projects such as the Communicore Hall and Moana's Journey of Water.\n\nIf Imagineering is aware of these criticisms, I suspect they are, it's less clear if they're taking them seriously. The Los Angeles Times was given a tour of the Haunted Mansion by Kim Irvine, the executive creative director of the Disneyland arm of Walt Disney Imagineering. Her history with the resort is well known to fans; she is a second-generation Imagineer \u2014 her mother, Leota Toombs, provided the face for Madame Leota.\n\nWhen the subject of the knockoff art in the gift shop came up, this was Irvine's response:\n\n\"How they can find one thing out of all this cool stuff,\" Irvine says of the fan outcry, trailing off as she stood in the shop full of artfully created oddities and references to tarot and mysticism. She stresses that the AI art was a temporary placeholder, noting there are many objects coming to the shop \u2014 more paintings and tapestries among them \u2014 that are in the process of being fireproofed before final install. \"They felt like it would be appropriate for a short time until they could put something else in,\" Irvine says of the ill-fated art. \"They never intended to do anything bad, and it is gone now. We're going to bring something back in that is hand-painted, like all of these other pieces are.\"\n\nIt's telling that Irvine's first reaction is a defensive one. Yes, how did some of the most passionate, dedicated fans on god's green earth notice a piece of art clearly created by artificial intelligence. That first reaction suggests dismay that Imagineering was caught, not that it happened in the first place.\n\nAnd then there's the distancing. Who is the they that Irvine speaks of? If someone other than Imagineering was to blame for the design of the store, fair enough. I'm not here to adjudicate the power politics of a company as large as Disney. But if it was Imagineering, there is no \"they\" to speak of. Irvine is responsible for the output of the outfit she is, presumably, paid handsomely to manage. That's part of the gig.\n\nThe interview goes on to cover the update to the Bride in the Haunted Mansion, no longer a ghostly murderer as has been the case for the past 20 years. No, the Bride will now strike a more somber tone; she is now a victim of heartbreak, not a greedy axe murderer. The new bride, and new tone, better fit the aesthetic the attic long captured. The melancholy of the \"Bridal Chorus\" has always clashed thematically with the Bride's sinister grin.\n\nBut here too, Irvine's messaging is odd:\n\n\"The bride that used to be in there was an axe murderer, and in this day and age we have to be really careful about the sensitivities of people,\" Irvine says. \"We were celebrating someone chopping off her husband's heads, and it was a weird story. I know the fans \u2014 some will like it and some will say, 'Oh, you changed something again.' That's our job. That's what we're here for.\"\n\nThis is probably worthy of its own piece, but were you celebrating someone chopping off her husband's heads? Or was it merely a piece of the loose narrative that has been told in the Haunted Mansion since the 1960s? You didn't build a statue to this would-be axe murderer in downtown Anaheim, you included her in a macabre ghost house. What are we doing here?\n\nThe interview culminates in the infamous stretching room, where the Hanging Man, implied to be our disembodied Ghost Host, has been the subject of speculation for years. It appears he has survived this latest cut, though Irvine indicates this has more to do with the challenges associated with modifying the structure than anything else.\n\n\"We're still looking at that,\" Irvine says. \"That one is complicated, structurally ... One thing at a time.\"\n\nThis sort of thing has been tricky for Disney in the past. The less savory aspects of Pirates of the Caribbean have long since been binned, though those changes are somewhat undercut by retaining Johnny Depp's likeness throughout the attraction. And it remains unclear to me whether those changes were responding to guest criticism or, well, something else. (The recent changes made to Jungle Cruise, on the other hand, were long overdue.)\n\nChanges to the Bride also seem to be responding to criticism that does not exist. Constance Hatchaway (subtle, the Haunted Mansion is not) appeared in gobs of merch over the past several years, at least suggesting fans were, well, still fans. Changing the Bride makes sense thematically, but it's not clear that's why Imagineering made the swap.\n\nAnd it's that lack of clear direction, limited ambition and fear of criticism that makes me increasingly skeptical Imagineering is capable of making the right call for the right reason. Is removing the Hanging Man the right way to go? I don't know. But I'm unconvinced Imagineering knows either; and I'm even less convinced they're up to the challenge of developing a worthy replacement.\n\n* * *\n\nTo keep up to date with more theme park news, please sign up for Theme Park Insider's weekly newsletter.\n\nReplies (26)\n\nThis article has been archived and is no longer accepting comments.",

One of the most thrilling rides in Disney World even with our sweet yeti stuck in an eternal B-mode disco.\n\nBut as much as I\u2019ve loved this iconic ride, I\u2019ve had to make the tough decision to start skipping it\u2014and you might need to as well.\n\nNow what makes this SO painful is that Expedition Everest is certainly a must-do in Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom as you can see in my video here\u2026\n\n\u2026but at least there are still 19 other must-dos I can experience.\n\nWhy I Loved Expedition Everest\n\nNow let me preface by saying I LOVED Expedition Everest \u2013 Legend of the Forbidden Mountain. Who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s one of the most thrilling rides in Disney World taking you high in the air, shooting you backwards, and bringing you face to face with a massive yeti.\n\nIt opened in 2006, the same year I turned 10 years old, and I remember how jaw-dropping the yeti animatronic was when she still moved. Betty might be frozen now (Yes, that\u2019s her real name.), but I still think she\u2019s awesome to see hanging over you. But as much as I love it, I am starting to skip this ride. And soon, it might be time for me to say goodbye to Betty forever.\n\nWhy I\u2019m Skipping It Now\n\nI\u2019ve always had some motion sickness issues and I know which rides tend to bring me some discomfort. Up until recently, Expedition Everest was not one of them. But, as I get into my late 20s, I\u2019ve started to get a bit more sensitive. And yes, I know late 20s is still very young \u2014 if I already can\u2019t ride Everest, what will be next?\n\nFor me, Everest now causes headaches that can bug me for a big part of my day. So honestly, it was an easy choice to start skipping it. Say goodbye to one ride I love or let it always ruin the rest of my Animal Kingdom day? I do still ride Everest every now and again \u2014 like when I attempt to ride everything in Disney World in one day \u2014 but honestly, I don\u2019t miss it. I\u2019ve had to learn that sometimes your must-do won\u2019t stay that way forever.\n\nHow It Could Happen To You\n\nYou might be reading this and thinking, \u201cYeah, welcome to aging, kid,\u201d or maybe you\u2019re thinking, \u201cNow, hang on. I\u2019m 65 and I can ride Expedition Everest without a hitch! You sure you\u2019re 28?\u201d And, I hear ya.\n\nBut there are a lot of reasons that you might have to make the call to start skipping a favorite of yours! Health and physical comfort, sensitivity to motion, and even your preferences can significantly change over time. It can be hard to make that decision that a ride you once loved just isn\u2019t right for you anymore, but I can at least say that I\u2019m loving my Animal Kingdom days a lot more now that I\u2019m skipping it.\n\nWhat I\u2019m Doing Instead\n\nThere are certainly alternatives to riding Everest four times in a row like I used to! Of course, Animal Kingdom has other wonderful rides like Na\u2019vi River Journey or Kilimanjaro Safaris (which I now tend to ride at least twice in a day).\n\nPlus, skipping Everest gives me more time to explore the animal trails or become a Wilderness Explorer. And, I still love Everest, just now from the outside. It\u2019s hard to find Disney World views as beautiful as Everest at night!\n\nSo, if you start to notice changes in how you feel on or about a ride, don\u2019t be too afraid to adjust your park habits. We change a lot and skipping Everest could unlock your new favorite way to see the parks.\n\nJoin the AllEars.net Newsletter to stay on top of ALL the breaking Disney News!

            "content": "While most people think of Disney as a company that makes movies or builds theme parks, it can\u2019t be overlooked that there\u2019s a third pillar of the massive Disney machine that is as valuable, if not more so, to the company\u2019s bottom line: merchandise for those movies and theme parks.\n\nSince the days of the first Mickey Mouse doll, selling \u201cstuff\u201d has been a major component of Disney\u2019s market strategy. It feels like Disney will merchandise anything. Every year, the company releases all new merch to promote its new films, new Disney World attractions, the anniversaries of films and theme park attractions, and whatever else it thinks people will buy. This is why I was shocked to get my hands on something from Disney World that you can\u2019t buy, but you absolutely should be able to.\n\nDisney World Released A Unique Item For Space Mountain\u2019s 50th Anniversary\n\nJanuary 15, 2025, marked the 50th anniversary of the opening of Walt Disney World\u2019s Space Mountain, the first version of Disney Parks' now iconic ride. As part of that, I recently received an item that I had never seen before, but something I bet Disney Parks could sell a ton of if they were available for purchase: a Disney World-themed height chart.\n\n(Image credit: Dirk Libbey)\n\nThe item is five feet long with notations every inch, a standard height chart that any family might use to keep track of a growing kid. With two small children of my own, I have a particular doorframe in my own house dedicated to the same purpose.\n\nHowever, what sets this particular height chart apart is that it has notations for every Walt Disney World attraction that has a height requirement at the appropriate point. This means kids can not only keep track of how much taller they\u2019re getting, but they can see how close they\u2019re getting to being able to ride the next big Disney World attraction.\n\nHow Are Disney World And Disneyland Height Charts Not Already A Thing?\n\nAs a dad who visits theme parks often and loves to take his kids there when he can, I will be keeping this chart on hand to use for my own kids. I could even see myself, and others, planning trips to the parks based on hitting these milestones. Once a kid is tall enough to ride Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, they\u2019re going to want to ride it, after all.\n\nThe chart also has the potential to temper expectations. Just like it can be frustrating to discover the ride you wanted to do is closed at Disney World, it can be frustrating to discover you're not tall enough to ride it. This offers a physical way for kids to understand what they can't do before they get there.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThis is why this feels like an obvious thing for Disney Parks and for the online Disney Store to offer, but they currently don\u2019t and I can\u2019t find evidence such things have ever been available. Something like this acts as both a merchandise item and a marketing opportunity. It\u2019s the sort of cross-promotion that Disney loves to do.\n\nEvery Disney Parks location could have its own version, noting each of its height requirement attractions. They could even have them done in multiple themes depending on which particular attraction a kid is particularly working toward.\n\nHaving now seen this, I can't believe it's not a thing that already exists. It's so brilliant that, at least now, it's obviously a thing that should be available. Let's fix this please.",

This leading diversified international family entertainment and media enterprise operates through three business segments \u2014 Entertainment, Sports and Experiences.\n\nHere are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management\u2019s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\n\nHowever, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. The Walt Disney Co. , Leidos Holdings, Inc. , Raymond James Financial, Inc. , Cencora, Inc. and Delta Air Lines, Inc. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nDespite signs of decelerating inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve is widely believed to have kept the interest rates steady in its next policy meeting scheduled to be held by the end of this month.

However, it can also be challenging, expensive, frustrating, scorchingly hot and the epicenter of toddler (and adult) meltdowns.\n\nThe version of Disney World you get is largely in your own hands.\n\nLuckily, there are easy expert-tested tips for visiting Disney World. Use these tips to save money, have fun and ensure your 2025 Disney World vacation is a success.\n\nConsider a summertime visit this year\n\nThis year will bring a number of changes to Disney World, with several new attractions opening across various parks.\n\nThis summer, the Magic Kingdom will debut \"Disney Starlight: Dream the Night Away,\" the first new nighttime parade at Disney in almost a decade. Meanwhile, Epcot will see a new Spaceship Earth-themed lounge open in late spring, followed by the reopening of a reimagined Test Track in late summer.\n\n\"Disney Starlight: Dream the Night Away.\" DISNEY\n\nAt Disney's Hollywood Studios, \"The Little Mermaid \u2014 A Musical Adventure\" and the new \"Disney Villains: Unfairly Ever After\" shows will also take to the stage this summer.\n\nUse our favorite dining hacks\n\nSUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY\n\nIn addition to their published menus, many of our favorite Disney World restaurants \u2014 including Nomad Lounge in Disney's Animal Kingdom, Trader Sam's Grog Grotto at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar at Disney Springs and Jungle Navigation Co. LTD Skipper Canteen at the Magic Kingdom \u2014 have off-menu \"secret items.\"\n\nSometimes, these secret menus can save you some big bucks. For example, you can get Ohana noodles from Disney's Polynesian Village Resort without paying the hefty prix fixe price of an Ohana dinner by ordering a bowl from Tambu Lounge next door. It's not on the menu, but you can ask for it.\n\nPrevious slide Next slide 1 of 2 SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY 0 1\n\nAnother of our favorite ways to save on Disney dining is to settle in at one of Disney World's many atmospheric lounges rather than hitting up a table-service restaurant at every meal. You'll still have a table and a server, but you can order from a menu of lighter bites and creative cocktails without spending too much on an expensive meal.\n\nDaily Newsletter Reward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter Join over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG\u2019s experts Email address Sign up By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy . You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\nRelated: Why Epcot is now Disney World's must-do park\n\nFor example, at Space 220 Restaurant in Epcot, the set lunch menu costs $55 for adults and $29 for children. However, you can still enjoy the space view in the lounge, which offers heavy appetizers ranging between $12 and $18.\n\nSUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY\n\nSome of Disney World's best lounges include the previously mentioned Nomad Lounge at Disney's Animal Kingdom, Geyser Point Bar & Grill at Disney's Wilderness Lodge, Steakhouse 71 Lounge at Disney's Contemporary Resort and Sanaa Lounge at Disney's Animal Kingdom Villas \u2014 Kidani Village.\n\nLastly, if you don't feel like sitting down in a restaurant or lounge after a long day at a park, ordering takeout from some of Disney World's most popular restaurants is a great alternative dinner option. Just type \"to go\" into the My Disney Experience app search bar to see a list of restaurants where you can mobile-order a full meal. You can take your food back to your room or to the nightly outdoor movie showing at your Disney World hotel.\n\nCreate your own souvenirs\n\nBROOKE MCDONALD/THE POINTS GUY\n\nRecreation cast members at Disney World resorts run free daily activities, from poolside trivia to evening s'mores around the campfire to movies under the stars. They also offer paid activities where you can make fun do-it-yourself souvenirs, such as tie-dyed Mickey T-shirts.\n\nAt Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, for example, you can choose colored nuts and string to make your own kukui nut lei ($15 for kids and $20 for adults). Several Disney World resorts also have Community Halls where guests can watch movies, play games and make crafts \u2014 either for free or a small fee.\n\nKnow when you can make your Lightning Lane selections\n\nLightning Lane entrance for Dumbo the Flying Elephant. TARAH CHIEFFI/THE POINTS GUY\n\nIf you are staying at a Disney Resort hotel (including the Swan and Dolphin properties or Shades of Green), you can purchase Lightning Lane passes up to seven days before your vacation at 7 a.m. Eastern time for the entire length of your stay (up to 14 days).\n\nYou can read the full details in TPG's guide, but this gives you a head start over off-site guests, who can only purchase and begin planning their Lightning Lane selections up to three days in advance. Lightning Lane passes for popular attractions get snatched up quickly, so have a plan for which attractions and return times you prefer before your booking window opens. This will give you the best shot at skipping the line for Disney's top-tier rides at your preferred times.\n\nSnag hard-to-get dining reservations\n\nYou can book Disney World dining reservations 60 days in advance. However, guests staying on Disney World property with their booking linked in the My Disney Experience app can make reservations 60 days plus the length of their stay in advance. In other words, guests staying for five days can book some meals 65 days before their arrival.\n\nThis further-out booking window means you'll have a better chance of scoring the most desirable reservations, which often sell out more than 60 days in advance.\n\nOga's Cantina. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY\n\nSome of the hardest-to-snag reservations include Cinderella's Royal Table, Space 220 Restaurant, Topolino's Terrace \u2014 Flavors of the Riviera, Oga's Cantina, Ohana and Roundup Rodeo BBQ at Disney's Hollywood Studios.\n\nYou'll want to book these (or your most coveted restaurant) as soon as your booking window opens. Guests have until two hours before their reservation time to cancel, so something could always open up at the last minute if you keep checking.\n\nIf you want someone else to do the hard work for you, there are websites specifically designed to alert you when a hard-to-find reservation opens up. The Disney planning site TouringPlans has a free alert service that will notify you via text or email when a reservation for your chosen date and time range becomes available.\n\nRelated: The best $120 I've spent at Disney this year got me into the Magic Kingdom's secret tunnels\n\nTake advantage of free ice water\n\nBringing a refillable water bottle to the parks is never a bad idea. However, if you need some water on the go, ask for a free cup of ice water at any quick-service location serving fountain drinks.\n\nOftentimes, a Disney cast member will be stationed at the door checking for mobile order return notifications, so just let them know you'd like a cup of ice water. They'll direct you to a numbered pickup counter to grab one.\n\nSave money by choosing your dates carefully\n\nSUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY\n\nJust like it costs more to fly or book a hotel during busy weekends and holidays, it also costs more to get entrance tickets to Disney World at certain times of the year.\n\nTicket prices vary by date and park, with some days being significantly cheaper than others. Disney's Animal Kingdom is positioned as the least expensive park, while the Magic Kingdom is the priciest park. Single-day tickets start at $119 per person for Animal Kingdom and can cost up to $199 each for the Magic Kingdom.\n\nRelated: These are the best times to visit Disney World\n\nAdditionally, the cost of the reduce-the-line Lightning Lane pass varies by day. It costs more on busier days (and has even sold out on a few occasions), so the price differences can add up if you want to go to Disney World on a peak date.\n\nOpt for other payment options besides cash\n\nTHE POINTS GUY\n\nAn easy way to shave anywhere from 3% to 10% off the cost of your trip is to buy discounted Disney gift cards to use for everything \u2014 your Disney hotel or Disney Vacation Club dues, park tickets, merchandise and dining.\n\nYou can get them from Target (there's a 5% discount when using a Target Circle\u2122 Card) or from Sam's Club and BJ's at a 3% to 4% discount. Even if you don't get a discount, you can earn bonus points on your rewards credit card by strategically buying Disney gift cards at grocery stores and office supply stores.\n\nSome cash-back credit cards also include wholesale warehouses in their quarterly cash-back categories, boosting your overall savings. Chain retailers like Meijer, Kroger and Lowe's occasionally run promos that can nab you even more savings on gift cards, too, so you may be able to get up to about 10% off.\n\nIf your heart is set on one of Disney's Deluxe resorts but your wallet says otherwise, you can often save money on pricey nightly rates by renting Disney Vacation Club points.\n\nDepending on which credit cards you keep in your wallet, you may also be able to redeem points for your Disney World tickets or a points hotel near Disney World.\n\nThe information for the Target Circle Card credit card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nAssume it will rain \u2014 and plan accordingly\n\nSUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY\n\nThis is Central Florida, so there's always a chance you'll get stuck in a pop-up afternoon thunderstorm. The right preparation can mean letting a little rain roll off your (covered) back instead of drenching your parade. You can get \"rain ready\" with these tips:\n\nWear waterproof shoes (read: no sneakers and socks that can get soaked).\n\nBring a travel umbrella and a poncho or rain jacket.\n\nCover your stroller with a waterproof cover whenever there's even the slightest chance of a shower.\n\nConsider the forecast when you choose what to ride first (you may need to prioritize outdoor rides).\n\nMany of Walt Disney World's outdoor attractions close temporarily during rain and lightning. If you have your heart set on a top-tier ride (such as Slinky Dog Dash, Test Track, Expedition Everest \u2014 Legend of the Forbidden Mountain or Seven Dwarfs Mine Train) don't wait until the end of the day to try to ride. If you do and rain comes your way, you could be out of luck.\n\nCarefully consider where you stay\n\nWalt Disney World Swan Grotto Pool. WALT DISNEY WORLD SWAN\n\nDisney World has some truly fabulous resort hotels \u2014 but they regularly cost $500 or more per night. If your budget can't quite handle such a splurge, consider some of Disney's Moderate hotels (here's our favorite hidden gem) and renovated Value options.\n\nRelated: The best hotels near Disney World you can book with points\n\nIf a traditional Disney property isn't feasible for you, remember that you can get several of the same perks you'd receive if you stayed on property at the Swan and Dolphin properties or one of the Disney Springs hotels. As an added bonus, many of these properties participate in major hotel loyalty programs like Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors.\n\nTake advantage of free water park visits for Disney hotel guests\n\nDisney's Blizzard Beach water park. WALT DISNEY WORLD\n\nDisney Resort hotel guests can start their 2025 vacation off with a splash with a free water park visit on their check-in day. Tickets to Disney's Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach water parks typically cost $74 plus tax for adults and $68 plus tax for kids ages 3 to 9. (Kids under 3 are free at all Disney World parks.) This perk can save you a nice chunk of change and get the vacation fun going as soon as you arrive on the property.\n\nThis offer is only available to guests at one of Disney's official hotels \u2014 so consider either taking the early flight or staying off-property on your arrival day to make the most of your check-in day. When you book your 2025 stay, Disney will send information before your arrival on how to take advantage of your free water park visit.\n\nAllow time for a resort day (or 2)\n\nStormalong Bay pool at Disney's Beach and Yacht Club resorts. SUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY\n\nThere's so much to do around Walt Disney World that you could easily fill several days with activities that don't require buying a park ticket. If you're visiting for several days, consider adding some activities outside the parks.\n\nTry a round of miniature golf \u2014 or 18 holes of the real thing \u2014 in the morning or some pool time in the afternoon. Visit Disney Springs for dinner and a showing of Cirque du Soleil's \"Drawn to Life.\" Or, consider \"Drawn to Life's\" ultimate Page to Stage experience for a behind-the-scenes tour and a keepsake souvenir.\n\nCirque du Soleil's \"Drawn to Life.\" MATT BEARD/WALT DISNEY WORLD\n\nAnother good time to plan a resort day is before annual after-hours events like Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party and Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party. Those go well into the night, so you'll need to save up some energy.\n\nSave character dining for nonpark days\n\nCharacter dining at Topolino's Terrace \u2014 Flavors of the Riviera. MATT STROSHANE/DISNEY\n\nCharacter meals tend to be a trip highlight, but too often, guests make the mistake of trying to cram a morning character breakfast into an already full park day. Instead, save those character meals for a resort day, special dinner on your arrival night or farewell breakfast on your departure morning.\n\nRelated: We put it to the test: Disney Lightning Lanes slashed wait times in half and get on 16 rides in 1 day\n\n\n\nBook breakfast as late as possible if you have your heart set on a particular in-park character meal. Make it a brunch so you can save your early morning hours for scoring shorter waits on rides.\n\nTrade fireworks and parades for shorter lines\n\nIf parades and nighttime spectaculars aren't must-see activities for you \u2014 especially if you have multiple days in the same park \u2014 skip the show and hop in line for a popular ride instead. You're all but guaranteed a shorter wait.\n\nKeep an eye on character meet-and-greet hours\n\nMickey and Minnie at Disney's Hollywood Studios. OLGA THOMPSON/DISNEY\n\nMany character meet-and-greets start later and end earlier than when the parks open and close. Be sure to check any must-meet character's appearance times in the My Disney Experience app; this way, you can avoid the heartbreak of missing out on a Winnie the Pooh hug or Wookiee fist bump from Chewbacca.\n\nKnow how to get in early or stay late\n\nDisney lets resort guests staying on property or in select affiliated hotels (like the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin properties and the Disney Springs hotels) into any of the four main theme parks 30 minutes early to begin enjoying select attractions.\n\nSUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY\n\nAdditionally, on select nights, those in Deluxe Disney resorts (and, again, including those at the Swan and Dolphin hotels and Shades of Green) can stay two hours after the parks close to enjoy select attractions with relatively minimal waits.\n\nUsually, Epcot and the Magic Kingdom alternate staying open late on select nights. On nights that Epcot is open late, travelers staying in eligible resorts get an extra chance to get a virtual queue boarding pass to ride Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind.\n\nMake your mobile orders in advance\n\nUsing the mobile order option in the My Disney Experience app can save a ton of time when ordering food from quick-service restaurants. But, on busy days at popular spots, the return times can get backed up quickly.\n\nSUMMER HULL/THE POINTS GUY\n\nYou can dodge this whole situation by placing your order and setting your ideal return time early in the day. Or, keep an eye on return times to ensure you place your order before your desired window is gone. You can always modify your return window within Disney's app if you need to change it.\n\nBottom line\n\nBetween having the right gear in your theme park bag, knowing about the hidden layers of magic built into Disney and following these practical tips, you're well on your way to being a Disney World pro. Not to mention, you'll be saving time and money.\n\nRelated reading:",

William \u201cBill\u201d Connelly with a special flag retreat ceremony at Magic Kingdom Park, capping off his 100th birthday celebration.\n\nDuring World War II, Col. Connelly served his country in the 115th Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army. He was drafted as an 18-year-old, and with help from the Army, he finished high school, went to college and ROTC (Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps), earned his bachelor\u2019s degree and was commissioned as a U.S. Army officer.\n\nHe was involved in both the European and Pacific theaters, including the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach, Normandy, France. A soldier for 27 years, he spent most of his career working with the Counterintelligence Corps and was awarded the Bronze Star for Meritorious Service in a Combat Zone.\n\nPhotos from Bill\u2019s time in the U.S. Army. Courtesy of William Connelly\n\nCelebrating Col. Connelly at Magic Kingdom Park\n\nTogether with his family, Col. Connelly became part of a beloved Disney tradition of daily flag ceremonies dating back nearly 70 years.\n\nGathered around the flagpole on Main Street U.S.A., Dapper Dans sang the national anthem as the color guard stood proudly alongside members of the Disney SALUTE veteran employee resource group. The flag was lowered by Magic Kingdom\u2019s security team and handed to Col. Connelly, who was cheered on by guests and cast members.\n\n\u201cIt really is an honor,\u201d said Col. Connelly. \u201cYou make a guy feel good\u2014that\u2019s the best way I can describe it\u2014all of you.\u201d\n\nAttending the ceremony was Col. Connelly\u2019s son-in-law, Geoffrey Grike, senior systems engineer, Disney Experiences, who was thrilled to see one of his heroes honored in such a special way as part of celebrating his milestone birthday.\n\n\u201cWhat an amazing flag retreat ceremony at Magic Kingdom honoring my father-in-law, Col. William A. Connelly\u2014a loving husband of 63 years, a father of three daughters, grandfather of six, great-grandfather of six, a World War II veteran, and now a centenarian,\u201d said Grike. \u201cSo many family memories have already been made here, and today\u2019s new memory will certainly never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nBill with his family in the Magic Kingdom in 2006. Photo courtesy of William Connelly Bill with his family in the Magic Kingdom, after being honored with a flag retreat ceremony on Jan. 10, 2025\n\nThis was a touching moment for the entire Connelly family, who have been spending their family vacations at Walt Disney World Resort for more than 50 years.\n\n\u201cWe first visited Disney in 1973 and have been back nearly every year since, to enjoy the parks and golf courses. This was always a vacation that the whole family looked forward to,\u201d said Col. Connelly.\n\nCreating Happiness for Service Members\n\nDisney has saluted our country\u2019s heroes with daily flag ceremonies since Disneyland Park opened in 1955 and Magic Kingdom Park opened in 1971. Today, the tradition continues with a daily flag retreat ceremony at both parks.\n\nWhile the patriotic display is always special, honoring heroes from the \u201cgreatest generation,\u201d such as Col. Connelly, is particularly meaningful.\n\nOver the years, Disney Parks have honored many veterans who served in World War II through flag retreat ceremonies, including 101-year-old U.S. Army Staff Sgt. \u201cPapa Jake\u201d Larson and 101-year-old Specialist S, 3rd Class for the U.S. Navy, Dorothy \u201cPat\u201d Rudd.\n\n\u201cPapa Jake\u201d Larson, 101-year-old World War II veteran stands with his granddaughter Mckaela after the flag retreat ceremony at Disneyland Park on Nov. 22, 2024 World War II and U.S. Navy veteran, Dorothy \u201cPat\u201d Rudd, participates in the flag retreat ceremony at Magic Kingdom on June 8, 2023\n\nEach day, a veteran or service member is selected from the day\u2019s visitors to be the official \u201cU.S. Armed Forces Representative of the Day\u201d and participate in the sunset ceremony in Magic Kingdom.\n\nOne former honoree is Bill\u2019s best friend and fellow U.S. Army veteran, Tony Gallego, who joined the celebration. Gallego was previously honored at a Magic Kingdom flag retreat ceremony in 2024, while celebrating his 100th birthday.\n\nBill poses in a Main Street vehicle with his best friend and fellow World War II veteran Tony Gallego\n\nFlag ceremonies are one of the many ways in which Disney aims to bring joy and happiness to veterans and military families, a legacy that started with Disney\u2019s founders Walt and Roy O. Disney, who both served their country during World War I.\n\nDisney also offers a special discount on theme park tickets for Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort for eligible U.S. military service members and veterans.\n\nTo learn more about Disney\u2019s commitment to championing veterans and military families, visit Impact.Disney.com.",

            "content": "As the Ghost Host famously tells guests inside Disney's Haunted Mansion attractions, there's always room for one more happy haunt to join the 999 souls inhabiting the classic ride \u2014 but Disney might actually remove a grim-grinning ghost from the iconic stretching room at the start of the experience.\n\nOne day ahead of Disneyland's planned reopening of the original 1969 iteration of the beloved dark ride (to add new theming elements and remove the temporary, annual Nightmare Before Christmas-themed seasonal overlay), Kim Irvine, creative director with Imagineering at Disneyland revealed that the company is weighing options to potentially revamp a scene at the start of the attraction, which sees a visual gag reveal a hanging corpse dangling from the rafters in the stretching room.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at that,\u201d Irvine \u2014 whose mother, Imagineer Leota Toombs, provided the face and voice for the ride's crystal ball-bound Madame Leota character \u2014 recently told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThat one is complicated, structurally ... One thing at a time.\"\n\nThe outlet noted that Irvine and her team initially spoke of removing the hanging corpse during a prior refurbishment in 2021, after, as the publication wrote, \"such an image could be triggering for some guests.\"\n\nAfter an introduction from the Ghost Host narrator, the stretching room scene welcomes riders into the world of the spooky experience, and ends with the voiceover challenging all in attendance to \"find a way out\" of the room that seemingly has \"no windows and no doors\" \u2014 a sequence that ends with a clap of thunder, dimmed lights, and a special effect that reveals a dead body hanging from a wooden beam at the top of the room. The narrator also teases that this manner of death is his preferred method of escaping the seemingly inescapable room.\n\nEntertainment Weekly has reached out to Disney representatives for comment.\n\nHanging corpse inside Haunted Mansion's holiday overlay. Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty\n\nIn recent years, Disney has worked to remove other theming elements from its attractions, including revamping both Splash Mountain flume rides into Princess and the Frog experiences at its American parks following criticism of the rides' storyline drawing inspiration from the 1946 movie Song of the South, a film long accused of perpetuating racist stereotypes. In 2021, Disney also reopened its classic Jungle Cruise boat ride at Disneyland after removing \"negative depictions\" of Native peoples throughout the attraction.\n\nThe new Times piece also highlighted a new addition to the Disneyland attraction, as the attraction will reopen with a new scene depicting the storied bride who inhabits the ride's attic sequence. Other additions include a new gift shop inspired by Madame Leota, as well as a refreshed outdoor queue space.\n\nThough Irvine's quotes referred to the Disneyland version of the ride in Anaheim, Calif., the Haunted Mansion also operates classic versions of the attraction at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Fla., and at Tokyo Disneyland in Japan. Other iterations inspired by the original (but with a different storyline) operate under the names Phantom Manor and Mystic Manor at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland, respectively.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nDisney has also adapted the Haunted Mansion into two different films: 2003's Eddie Murphy-starring The Haunted Mansion, and 2023's Haunted Mansion, featuring LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Jared Leto, and Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\n\"We got down to the point where we were obsessing over the angle you first see the mansion when you walk onto the ride in Disneyland \u2014 when we see it through the gates and we see the pillars, that angle has to hit. That's how specific we were,\" director Justin Simien previously told EW of designing the film's version of the titular abode. \"When you first glide through the dining hall and you see the waltzing dancers, that angle had to be right, because that's the one where you gasp on the ride.\"",

Today, Pixar shared the trailer and key art for Win or Lose.\n\n\u201cI played softball growing up,\u201d said Carrie Hobson, who wrote, directed, and executive produced the series with Michael Yates. \u201cInspired by that experience, we felt fast-pitch softball was the perfect backdrop for the show. There are so many facets to playing sports that I love \u2014 it can bring out the best and worst of a person, the calmest person can lose their temper. And when it comes to winning and losing \u2014 the consequences are nothing, and yet, they\u2019re everything. We really felt like it was the best arena for the themes we loved.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yates, the idea of spotlighting different perspectives was born of everyday life at Pixar. \u201cCarrie and I were officemates on Toy Story 4,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were both story artists on the film, and we would talk about a lot of things going on in the film, as well as things going on in the world \u2014 current events, news. We would always have different reactions or different interpretations of the same meeting. One of us would say, \u2018That went great!\u2019 and the other would say, \u2018No! It was terrible, what are you talking about?\u2019 We realized that our own experiences that we bring to the table change our perception of an event. We wanted to tell a story that illustrated all of that.\u201d\n\nWin or Lose features the voices of Will Forte, Rosie Foss, Josh Thomson, Milan Elizabeth Ray, Rosa Salazar, Dorien Watson, Izaac Wang, Chanel Stewart, Lil Re\u200bl Howery, Melissa Villase\u00f1or, Jo Firestone, Flula Borg, Kyleigh Curran, \u200bJaylin Fletcher, Erin Keif, Tom Law, Beck Nolan, Orion Tran, and Rhea Seehorn. The series, which presents incredibly funny, very emotional, and uniquely animated perspectives, is produced by David Lally and includes music by composer Ramin Djawadi and original songs by CAMPFIRE and Djawadi.",

They often visited Disney World growing up.\n\n\u201cI remember that we were always coming to Walt Disney World. Our family was here usually two to three times a year,\u201d said Gillian, a Scheduling Specialist in Workforce Management. \u201cEPCOT was always our favorite stop. It was the place we would go to the most and the most memorable park for us.\u201d\n\nDuring one of those early trips to EPCOT, their parents snapped this adorable photo of the sibling duo in the France Pavilion. They recently had the chance to recreate the image, reminiscing on how far they\u2019ve come since those childhood trips.\n\n\u201cWe loved the rides, the food and the shows, but the best part about visiting as a family so often was seeing many of the same cast members again,\u201d said Cullen, an Apprentice Electrician in Engineering Services. \u201cIt\u2019s cool that I now get to help others enjoy their family vacations like we did.\u201d\n\nDiscovering A New Home with Disney\n\nCarrying that special adoration of Disney into their adulthood, both Gillian and Cullen decided to join the Disney College Program. Quickly, they both knew they wanted to stay in Central Florida and pursue a career at Disney beyond their programs.\n\n\u201cI came down first, doing a College Program in Merchandise. It didn\u2019t take long before I knew I wanted to stay,\u201d Cullen explained. \u201cI joined the Watercraft team next, and that\u2019s where I found out about the apprenticeship programs that Disney offers. I thought it was so interesting.\u201d\n\nGillian followed her brother, and admittedly, had a hunch that she would also want to stay beyond her College Program because of the opportunities Disney offers.\n\n\u201cI knew before I moved down here that I wanted to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became evident very quickly that whatever career interests you, Disney will help you get to where you want to go. No matter your role or level, there\u2019s just so many opportunities to grow and people who will help you get to where you want to be.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how Gillian went from a Food & Beverage cast member on her College Program, to joining her brother on the Watercraft team and then eventually to Workforce Management, where she\u2019s been able to level up her skills and grow a successful career.\n\nChasing Their Career Dreams at Disney\n\nLooking back at their journeys, both Gillian and Cullen are so proud of how far they\u2019ve come.\n\n\u201cOn my team, we\u2019re always doing something different every day, which makes my role so exciting and fulfilling,\u201d Gillian said. \u201cLife has really come full circle for Cullen and I, working at Disney. We\u2019ve always wanted to be here and now we both have our own careers that are very different but both so fun.\u201d\n\nWhile Gillian is doing work behind the scenes, Cullen can usually be spotted at Magic Kingdom doing maintenance on animatronics and attractions all over the park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome that I get to say I work on that at Disney,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cEvery day, I put 100% in and do my best, and it\u2019s always so rewarding.\u201d Interested in starting a career at Disney like the Chase siblings?

            "content": "Planning a trip to Walt Disney World is no small task for most families. With two waterparks, a revamped \"downtown\" area, and four theme parks full of rides, live performances, and themed dining experiences, there's no shortage of options in the happiest place on earth.\n\nWhile it's no secret that a trip to Disney can be expensive between travel, park tickets, and food, many forget another limiting factor \u2014 time. With entry to a single park costing over $100, how can you be sure you're making the most of it and not spending all your time waiting in lines?\n\nTo discover how to make the most of your time and money during your next Disney trip, the FinanceBuzz team analyzed wait times for every attraction at Disney parks, current ticket prices, and the number of attractions per park. While lines may be unavoidable, we found ways to get the most bang for your buck and offer suggestions for finding the right time to visit if you want to get the most out of your next trip.\n\nKey findings\n\nThe average wait time across all Disney World parks is 38 minutes.\n\nParkgoers spend 17% of their time at Disney on a ride.\n\nThe best time to visit all four parks is the first week of September, with an average wait time of 25 minutes.\n\nThe worst time to visit all four parks is the last week of December, with an average wait time of 61 minutes.\n\nDisney World wait times by the numbers\n\nVisitors to Disney World can expect to pay between $150-$180 per person on admission for most of the year. Before spending money on food or merchandise, a family of four would be looking at more than $600 per day to get into one of the four Disney World amusement parks.\n\nWith admission so expensive, minimizing time spent waiting in line is important for getting the most out of your day. But just how easy is it to do that while still enjoying all the parks have to offer?\n\nTo start, we compared how long people wait in line versus how long rides take at the four parks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the 52 attractions Disney World offers at its four parks, guests can expect to wait an average of 38 minutes per ride.\n\nOf all the parks in Disney World, Magic Kingdom, its flagship park, has the shortest average lines at 29 minutes. Hollywood Studios, home to popular attractions like Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway, and Slinky Dog Dash, has the longest lines at an average of 44 minutes.\n\nOf note, lines at Animal Kingdom average just one minute shorter (43 minutes) than at Hollywood Studios. In 2022, the average wait time at the animal-themed park was just 34 minutes, representing the most significant change among all parks in that time frame.\n\nDisney World wait times are getting longer\n\nLong lines at Disney World aren't a new phenomenon. Since 2014, average ride lengths have increased from 28 minutes to 38 minutes, representing a 36% increase.\n\nIn 2024, the average wait time across all Disney World parks was 38 minutes, down three minutes from its peak in 2022 (41 minutes), the first year without entry limitations following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest and worst times to visit\n\nRegardless of which park you're interested in visiting, a few times of the year are consistently better than others in terms of lines, and if you've visited Florida in the summer, you can guess why.\n\nSeptember had the shortest average wait time for all four parks, averaging 30 minutes. Conversely, December was the worst month to visit Disney World, with an average wait time of 42 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage wait times at each Disney World park\n\nOf course, the lines you encounter at every park largely depend on demand for that ride and how quickly each ride can turn over new guests.\n\nWe looked at each attraction from the four parks to determine which rides had the longest (and shortest) lines and which offered the most bang for your buck regarding the time spent waiting in line versus time enjoying the attraction.\n\nMagic Kingdom\n\nYou can expect over an hour's wait at the Magic Kingdom on two rides: Peter Pan's Flight and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. The latter, a fun rollercoaster honoring Snow White's supporting cast, carries the longest line in the park at 74 minutes.\n\nSeven Dwarfs Mine Train is also one of the park's shortest rides, taking just three minutes. You'll spend 4% of your total time on the ride, the lowest of any attraction in the park.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress (a great option for anyone looking for an air-conditioned reprieve at the Magic Kingdom) has an average wait time of just five minutes in exchange for a 21-minute rotating animatronic performance.\n\nThis equates to 81% of your time watching the show: a great big beautiful tomorrow, indeed.\n\nEPCOT\n\nEPCOT's longest rides are some of their newest attractions, themed after hit movies. On average, lines for Frozen Ever After and Remy's Ratatouille Adventure clock in at over an hour each.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, lines at EPCOT average 37 minutes, while rides average 9.2 minutes, a 20% return on your time.\n\nHollywood Studios\n\nThe two longest lines in all Disney World parks are in Hollywood Studios. The average wait time for Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance is 81 minutes, and for Slinky Dog Dash, it's over an hour and a half (93 minutes).\n\nFor those looking for something shorter, Muppet*Vision 3D \u2014 a 3D movie starring Kermit, Fozzie Bear, and Miss Piggy \u2014 is just a 10-minute wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Kingdom\n\nThere's no shortage of things to do at Animal Kingdom, but there are limited options for actual rides, largely due to the number of live performances offered throughout the park.\n\nWhile Pandora \u2014 The World of Avatar, which opened in 2017, offers a beautiful (and mostly shaded) experience for parkgoers, it's also caused long lines for its breathtaking attractions.\n\nAvatar Flight of Passage and the Na'vi River Journey have average wait times of over 50 minutes, the highest of any attractions in Animal Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for saving on a magical vacation\n\nWaiting in line might be an inevitable part of a Disney vacation. However, you can get extra bang for your buck at the Most Magical Place on Earth by visiting at the right times of the year, optimizing the new Disney Genie+ and Lightning Lane options, arriving at the parks earlier in the day, and prioritizing parks with lower demand.\n\nBeyond these strategies, here are a few more tips for getting the most for your money on your next Disney vacation:\n\nEarn magical rewards on your purchases. Some credit cards earn rewards you can use for lodging and travel to Disney World, while others can give major bonuses for purchases made in the parks. Using a credit card optimized for Disney both before and during a Disney vacation can maximize the magic of your vacation.\n\nSome credit cards earn rewards you can use for lodging and travel to Disney World, while others can give major bonuses for purchases made in the parks. Using a credit card optimized for Disney both before and during a Disney vacation can maximize the magic of your vacation. Budget for your big trip. A trip to Disney World can come with a massive price tag between travel, hotels, park tickets, and everything else. Proper budgeting for a Disney vacation is a great way to minimize financial stress.\n\nMethodology\n\nWait times were pulled from Thrill-Data.com where average wait times are calculated based on times directly from theme park apps and user reporting. Only attractions with reliable historical wait time data were included in this analysis, and rides that solely utilize a virtual queue system were excluded. For that reason, attraction totals may vary from official Disney World listings.\n\nDecent Rewards for Disney Fans Disney\u00ae Visa\u00ae Card Benefits Card Details Discounts on select Disney purchases\n\nIntro vacation financing offer on select Disney vacation packages\n\n$0 annual fee\n\nApply Now Earn a $200 Statement Credit after you spend $500 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.\n\nEarn 1% in Disney Rewards Dollars on all card purchases.

            "content": "It may be the shortest month of the year, but Disney managed to pack a TON of fun things in for this February! We\u2019re excited to continue celebrating a special EPCOT festival, plus there\u2019s a special holiday to look forward to.\n\nSomehow, February is right around the corner, and that means a bunch of new Disney World CHANGES are on the horizon. If you\u2019re planning a trip to Disney World this February, here are all the biggest changes and events happening throughout the month!\n\nEPCOT Opens Late\n\nBe warned! EPCOT will open late on February 23rd. The park will not open until 10 AM, so if you\u2019ve got plans to visit this park, you can sleep in a little later.\n\nWhile Disney has not shared the official reason for this delayed opening, we have a feeling it is due to the Princess Half Marathon hosted by runDisney. The race takes place that morning, and participants run right through EPCOT during the race. That means EPCOT may need a little extra time after the event to make sure everything is cleaned up and ready to go before the park opens.\n\nKeep in mind that the Princess Half Marathon race weekend will likely be a busy time in Disney World. The weekend before the race is also Presidents Day, so we may see extra crowds as people take advantage of the short break.\n\nCheer Competitions\n\nThe UCA National High School Cheerleading Championship is happening February 7th\u201310th. In the past, we\u2019ve seen Disney World look extra busy during sports competitions, so expect higher wait times and longer lines around the parks.\n\nAdditionally, the All Out Grand Nationals 2025 cheerleading competition is scheduled for January 31st through February 2nd in Orlando. You might even see cheer groups at some of the Value Resorts, like Disney\u2019s All-Star Movies, Music, and Sports, so keep that in mind if you\u2019re booking a hotel.\n\nrunDisney Princess Half Marathon\n\nThe second runDisney race of the year is happening soon. In fact, the Disney Princess Half Marathon Weekend is fast approaching, so lace up those sneakers and get ready to race!\n\nThese events also tend to bring a LOT of people to Disney World (both runners and their friends and family to cheer them on), so expect some extra crowds and traffic in the area. The Princess Half Marathon Weekend will happen from February 20th through February 24th, 2025. If you\u2019re participating in the race, good luck!\n\nValentine\u2019s Day\n\nValentine\u2019s Day is Friday, February 14th, and Disney does a few fun things to celebrate!\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve seen special character meet-and-greets, exclusive treats, and festive decorations around the parks and resorts! Disney tends to keep those special character appearances a secret, so be on the lookout if you\u2019re visiting the parks on Valentine\u2019s Day. You never know who you might see!\n\nFestival of the Arts Ends in EPCOT\n\nOne of our FAVORITE EPCOT festivals will come to and end in February. The EPCOT International Festival of the Arts takes place from January 17th through February 24th, 2025, meaning the last few days of the month will be festival-free in EPCOT.\n\nThis event is pretty short, so if you\u2019re interested, you only have a few weeks to check it out. From the fun snacks to the STUNNING artwork, there\u2019s a lot to love about this seasonal event.\n\nEPCOT After Hours Events Return\n\nThere\u2019s a way to enjoy shorter wait times, smaller crowds, AND get free unlimited popcorn! How? Thanks to Disney\u2019s specially ticketed After Hours Events!\n\nAfter Hours Events will return to EPCOT on February 27th! These events will happen on select nights through September 25th, 2025.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a travel agent to help with your vacation, we recommend our friends at Mouse Fan Travel. They\u2019re experts in the field with over 20 years of vacation planning experience, and they can help take a bunch of the stress out of the entire booking process for you!\n\nAs you can see, it will be a BUSY February!

            "content": "Amid the devastating wildfires impacting the Los Angeles area, The Walt Disney Company has been working around the clock to find ways to support its community and employees in the LA area during this tragic time.\n\nThis week, Disney Entertainment Television invited employees, production crew, and their families who lost their homes to its wardrobe warehouse in North Hollywood to collect new or gently used clothing and shoes from recent Disney film and TV productions at no expense.\n\n\u201cMost companies are not sitting on an entire warehouse full of wardrobe \u2014 some of which has been barely used, if it\u2019s been used at all,\u201d said Heidi Chong, Vice President of Production Shared Services for Disney Entertainment Television. \u201cWe really want to emphasize to the families: \u2018If you come here, we\u2019ve already organized everything for you. It\u2019s all on display on the racks. You can find what you need.\u2019 There are no limits to the amounts that people are getting; it\u2019s really about what they need.\u201d\n\nBelen Buenrrostro, Manager, Asset Management, Disney Entertainment Television, jumped into action e-mailing her manager about opening the warehouse to those affected and said, \u201cThis might be a long shot, but can we make it happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe turnaround was so quick, but we had an outpouring of support,\u201d Buenrrostro continued. \u201cIt was nice to see us all come together as a Disney family to help everybody.\u201d\n\nCollective Compassion\n\nTo make this resource a reality, this employee-driven effort required company-wide collaboration.\n\nChong noted that \u201cwe involved a lot of teams to pull this event together quickly,\u201d including Disney Entertainment Television, Human Resources, Global Security, communications, and some of the production teams.\n\nDisney Entertainment Production worked in the warehouse all weekend long \u2014 and by Monday, more than 80 Disney VoluntEARS were unpacking boxes, sorting items by size and style, and preparing to welcome members of the Disney community who needed their support.\n\n\u201cDisney has been coordinating a lot of resources through our Employee Care & Support team,\u201d said Chong. \u201cWe worked with that team to identify which families had been impacted and should be invited to this event.\u201d\n\nInvitations were sent out via email earlier this week. Invited Cast Members and employees are asked to register online and select a shopping window that is convenient for them. If the dates and/or times do not work \u2014 or if they are in more urgent need \u2014 accommodations will be made to assist them.\n\n\u201cWe really want to make the experience as easy and friendly as possible,\u201d Buenrrostro said. \u201cWe give everyone a rack and assign them a buddy shopper. We also set up a play area for the kids, where we stream Disney+ movies and offer games and snacks.\u201d\n\nCommon Thread\n\nThe warehouse includes wardrobe from productions such as Genius: MLK/X, grown-ish, The Old Man, Station 19, UnPrisoned, and Wizards Beyond Waverly Place. This has allowed Disney to offer a wide variety of options to each Cast Member, employee, and family member.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very heartwarming to see everybody find things they like,\u201d Buenrrostro said. \u201cWe had one family that\u2019s really into vintage clothing, and they were so excited that we offer more than just new, store-bought items.\u201d\n\nBuenrrostro noted that \u201cwe have tons of clothes\u201d \u2014 over 250 racks, in fact, and were able to get another 50 racks in just a day.\n\nThe support that Disney is offering also extends to the greater Los Angeles area. Last week, the company announced that it is committing $15 million for initial and immediate response and rebuilding efforts.\n\nAccording to Chong, the event has been empowering for everyone involved.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to participate and wants to help those around them, but it\u2019s hard to know how,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was very tangible. There was real work to do, whether that was packing bags or unboxing new clothing items, and today we\u2019re seeing that make a real impact on individuals\u2019 lives at a time when everything feels overwhelming.\u201d\n\nChong said that this resource has been \u201csomething that\u2019s made me feel really proud to be part of Disney \u2014 especially today.\u201d",

FLORIDA TODAY's Christina LaFortune got to experience the new TRON Lightcycle/Run thrill ride at Disney's Magic Kingdom. Here's what the ride is like. Christina LaFortune, Florida Today\n\nA Disney icon turns 50 years old on Wednesday.\n\nSpace Mountain debuted at Walt Disney World on Jan. 15, 1975.\n\n\u201cLike many great ideas, it came from the imagination of Walt Disney,\u201d Steven Vagnini, content strategy manager for Walt Disney Archives, told USA TODAY.\n\n\u201cWalt first had the idea for a high-speed trip through space as part of a reimagining of (Disneyland\u2019s) Tomorrowland that would have taken place in the 1960s,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a revolutionary idea.\u201d\n\nIt was so far ahead of its time that it took years for the technology to catch up, to make it a reality.\n\nAs Space Mountain marks its 50th anniversary, here\u2019s what Disney fans should know.\n\nWhat is Space Mountain known for?\n\nSpace Mountain is known for hurtling guests through the dark, like rockets shooting through space. It was the first coaster experience to be fully enclosed and in the dark, according to Vagnini. It was also the first to be fully controlled by a computer, which was game-changing.\n\n\u201cThis allowed us to have two totally separate ride paths through space. The zone systems allowed multiple rockets to allow guests to be transported through the cosmos at once,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd the fact that it's all in the dark ... that adds to the thrill. You don't know if they're going to be going left or right or up or down.\u201d\n\nSpace Mountain at Walt Disney World\n\nThrill was just what Disney World was looking for after opening in 1971. The following year, Imagineers revived Walt Disney\u2019s idea for a Space Voyage, as Space Mountain.\n\nOn the ride\u2019s opening day in 1975, Vagnini said one of its lead Imagineers, Disney Legend John Hench, watched the reactions of its first guests:\n\nThe vehicle comes to a stop, and, as he described it, there was dead silence. All of a sudden, one of the guests steps out of the vehicle. She kneels down and loudly kisses the carpet. John follows them. At the time, there was a moving ramp in the post-show area, and John listens in to the conversation. He hears them laughing. He hears them patting each other on the back. And John explained it this way: he realized these people had not felt so alive as they did in that moment, in years.\n\nSpace Mountain at Disneyland\n\nWith Space Mountain\u2019s success at Disney World, Vagnini said it quickly became a priority to open one at Disneyland, where the idea began.\n\nDisneyland\u2019s Space Mountain opened in 1977, but it wasn\u2019t a carbon copy. Among the differences, Vagnini noted that even including a portion of Disneyland\u2019s ride that starts underground, Disney World\u2019s 183-foot version is still taller. Disneyland uses one track instead of two, but its track is about 10% longer than Disney World\u2019s track. Also, Disneyland\u2019s ride cars seat two people side-by-side instead of only one-per-row at Disney World.\n\n\u201cWe treat each attraction uniquely in every park it goes in,\u201d Vagnini said. \u201cIt's not the exact same attraction, and it's certainly not the same experience.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true even in the same park.\n\n\u201cAt Disneyland, in 2005 there was a major refurbishment, which totally enhanced the attraction with a brand-new musical score by Michael Giacchino,\u201d Vagnini said. \u201cA couple years later, we added (an) overlay called Rockin\u2019 Space Mountain, which was a very unique take on Space Mountain at the time, featuring music by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. And then in 2009, Disneyland introduced Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy, which was a Halloween Time theme overlay that had premiered just a couple years earlier at Hong Kong Disneyland.\u201d\n\nSpace Mountain at Tokyo Disneyland\n\nThe third Space Mountain opened at Tokyo Disneyland in 1983.\n\n\u201cThis would mark the first time that Space Mountain opened in conjunction with the park\u2019s opening as well,\u201d Vagnini said. \u201cThe Tokyo version of the attraction would debut in a format that was more similar to the Disneyland version of the attraction.\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t staying that way. Last summer, Tokyo\u2019s version closed for a major reimagining of Tomorrowland. When it reopens in 2027, the rebuilt attraction will retain \u201cthe original concept as a thrilling indoor coaster that takes guests on a high-speed journey through space but will include enhanced performance and immersive special effects,\u201d according to the official Disney Parks Blog. \u201cThese will give guests even more thrills throughout their journey and will provide a greater connection between Earth and the universe.\u201d\n\nSpace Mountain at Disneyland Paris\n\nIn 1995, Disneyland Paris opened another take on Space Mountain in its Discoveryland, which Vagnini described as \u201cnot based so much on our current thinking about the future, but rather interpretations and visions of the future that were shared by legendary authors and science fiction writers.\u201d\n\nSpace Mountain De la Terre \u00e0 la Lune (From the Earth to the Moon) was inspired by Jules Verne\u2019s book of the same name.\n\n\u201cIn the story \u2018From the Earth to the Moon,\u2019 you have this idea of propulsion via a giant cannon out into space and eventually reaching the moon. And that drove the story of our Disneyland Paris attraction originally,\u201d Vagnini said. \u201cThat would be a first for the themed entertainment industry, having this canon-style launch, this catapult system. Traditionally, our Space Mountain attractions featured the chain lift.\u201d\n\nHe said the attraction was also the first Disney thrill ride, across parks, to debut onboard audio and the first to feature inversions, with three. Over the years, it\u2019s evolved with new storylines and theming and is currently Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain.\n\nSpace Mountain at Hong Kong Disneyland\n\nThe fifth Space Mountain opened with Hong Kong Disneyland\u2019s opening in 2005.\n\n\u201cThat was the next version of Space Mountain, which today is known as Hyperspace Mountain, featuring a very special Star Wars experience all throughout,\u201d Vagnini said.\n\nThe attraction\u2019s webpage describes the experience as rocketing into a \"raging dogfight between Rebel X-wing starfighters and Imperial TIE fighters.\u201d\n\nTRON at Shanghai Disneyland\n\nDisney had something else in mind for Shanghai Disney Resort, which was designed to be, as Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger put it, \u201cauthentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.\u201d\n\nInstead of building another Space Mountain, Vagnini said, \u201cThe Imagineers kept going back to this idea of Shanghai being such a forward-looking city, one that is constantly evolving, and so the inspiration came to do something completely different ... And the idea of incorporating the stories of \u2018Tron\u2019 and \u2018Tron: Legacy,\u2019 which was our sequel released in the year 2010, was something top of mind and captivated the imagination of the designers and the Imagineers involved. And so the end result was a totally new experience for a totally new Tomorrowland.\u201d\n\nTRON Lightcycle Power Run opened with Shanghai Disney in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe great story there, too, is that now we have TRON Lightcycle / Run at Walt Disney World, which opened here in 2023 as a neighbor to Space Mountain here at the Magic Kingdom, where Space Mountain debuted 50 years ago,\u201d Vagnini added.\n\nWhat age is Space Mountain appropriate for?\n\nDisneyland and Walt Disney World\u2019s websites describe the ride\u2019s audience as kids, tweens, teens and adults. Disneyland\u2019s version has a 40-inch minimum height requirement, while Disney World\u2019s has a 44-inch height requirement.\n\n\u201cSome have called it a rite of passage,\u201d Vagnini said of when guests are big enough or brave enough to ride. \u201cWe have multiple generations of guests now who have experienced Space Mountain and share it with their friends and their families. You know, you look at this attraction, it\u2019s hard to believe it's 50 years because it is a classic attraction, and yet in so many ways, it is a timeless attraction.\u201d\n\nSpace Mountain also remains among the most popular attractions across Disney parks.",

They have permitted us to see the Earth as a precious blue jewel in the blackness of space. Now all of us may enjoy this sense of wonder because of Walt Disney.\"\n\n\n\nWith those words 50 years ago today (Jan. 15), Apollo 15 moonwalker Jim Irwin opened Space Mountain at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in Florida. Later to be reproduced at other Disney theme parks, this was the original \u2014 the first roller coaster intended to give the public the same feeling that only astronauts had experienced up until then.\n\n\n\n\"Blast off on a rip-roaring rocket into the furthest reaches of outer space on this roller-coaster ride in the dark,\" reads the current description of Space Mountain on the Walt Disney World Resort website.\n\n\n\nIn 1975, however, the very idea for such a ride preceded the existence of the technology needed to build it. First proposed by Disney and sketched out by Imagineer John Hench in 1964, construction on Space Mountain did not begin until Dec. 15, 1972, just as the last Apollo astronauts to walk on the moon were on their way back to Earth. It was also six years after the death of Walt Disney.\n\n\n\n\"Walt had a dream,\" said Irwin just before thousands of doves were released, daytime fireworks were launched and 50,000 red, white and blue balloons climbed into the sky. \"Today we see the results of that dream.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at the ride today, while certainly still a thrill, it has little resemblance to actual spaceflight. But in the 50 years that Space Mountain has been running, there have been and still are several nods to NASA and real space exploration. Here are five such connections, from both behind the scenes and on the ride.\n\n\n\n1. NASTRAN\n\n\n\nSpace Mountain was one of the first computer-controlled roller coasters. If the ride's \"space shuttles\" (or \"rocket sleds\") approached each other too closely, the computers slowed or stopped the vehicles.\n\n\n\nBut that is not the only way WED Enterprises (today, Walt Disney Imagineering Research and Development) used computers to ensure riders' safety.\n\n\n\nWhen working on the design for the support structure for Space Mountain's dual tracks, the Imagineers needed it to be strong but not wastefully overbuilt. That is when they learned of the NASA Structural Analysis Program, or NASTRAN. An offshoot of the software used to design air and spacecraft, NASTRAN enabled the imagineers to digitally model and test the ride track before building it.\n\n\n\n\"In this technique, engineers create a mathematical model of the aeronautical or space vehicle and 'fly' it on the ground by means of computer simulation. The technique enables them to study performance and structural behavior of a number of different designs before settling on the final configuration and proceeding with construction,\" wrote James Haggerty, in \"Spinoff 1977,\" an annual report put out by NASA about how its research and technologies are being put to use by industry and others outside of the space program.\n\n\n\n2. From computers to outer space\n\n\n\nIn 1975, the RCA Corporation was working on the development of closed-circuit television and other various subsystems for NASA's then-upcoming space shuttle program. It was also the presenting sponsor for Space Mountain.\n\n\n\n\"Naturally, the basic purpose of Space Mountain from the company's standpoint is to give the public a vivid picture of what RCA is all about and what it has accomplished in such diverse areas of as space exploration, electronic communications and home entertainment,\" said Mort Gaffin, RCA's director for corporate identification and graphics and project manager for Space Mountain, in the February/March 1975 issue of the company's newsletter \"Communicate.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, it may be because of RCA that Space Mountain launched the public on rockets and not motherboards. Initially, imagineers Hench and Marty Sklar approached the company about sponsoring a ride that take guests on a journey through a computer. It was only after RCA rejected that idea did Hench pick up on Disney's desire for a spaceflight experience, leading to RCA coming on board for $10 million.\n\n\n\nOn Space Mountain, riders saw astronauts working on an RCA-built Atmosphere Explorer Satellite and an orbiting laboratory being assembled remotely using TV systems furnished by RCA.\n\n\n\nA tall pylon installed at the entrance to Space Mountain displayed the RCA logo at its top and included the only direct reference to NASA. A full-size ride vehicle was suspended from the monument, complete with four astronaut figures. The spacesuits each astronaut rider is wearing had the NASA insignia on its chest.\n\n\n\n(RCA's sponsorship ran until 1993. The pylon was modified to show a three-seat vehicle in 1989, consistent with the change to the seating on the ride itself. Five years later, the pylon was removed and replaced with one of a different design.)\n\n\n\n3. 'One Giant Step'\n\n\n\nAt the base of the RCA pylon was a metal plaque \"presented by missile, space and range pioneers.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dedicated to the men and women whose skills, sacrifice, courage and teamwork opened the door to the exploration of man's exciting new frontier outer space. Because they dared to reach for the stars and the planets, man's knowledge of his universe, Earth and himself has been greatly enriched,\" read the plaque, which was titled \"One Giant Step.\"\n\n\n\nIt was one of those astronauts, Irwin, who took the first \"small step\" (or \"giant leap,\" depending on your perspective) onto Space Mountain on opening day, as the ride's first passenger.\n\n\n\n\"It's almost as rough as the ride on the Saturn V rocket,\" the Apollo 15 lunar module pilot said in an interview with RCA, referring to his ride to the moon.\n\n\n\nJoining Irwin at the ceremony were Mercury astronauts Scott Carpenter and Gordon Cooper. Carpenter had been the second American to orbit Earth in 1962; Cooper followed him as the last \"original\" astronaut to fly a year later and then commanded NASA's Gemini 5 mission in 1965.\n\n\n\nIn 1973, Cooper joined WED Enterprises to help develop Epcot and put the final touches on Space Mountain, the latter of which he said offered a \"realistic feeling\" of what it felt like to fly into space. He also recorded a video that guests saw when queuing up for the ride, explaining what they were about to go through and giving them the chance to exit should they change their mind.\n\n\n\n4. Rocket to the Moon\n\n\n\nPrior to Space Mountain, Disney's first space-themed attraction was \"Rocket to the Moon.\" Located in California as part of Disneyland's Tomorrowland (and later reproduced as \"Flight to the Moon\" at Walt Disney World in Florida in 1971), the show was developed with NASA's assistance. The attraction was re-themed to \"Mission to Mars\" at both parks within months of Space Mountain opening at the Magic Kingdom in 1975.\n\n\n\nThere is now a reference to the since-closed Mission to Mars on a panel in Space Mountain's queue, but it is another sign and a different \"rocket to the moon\" that serves as a nod to real space history.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the line for the ride, a backlit billboard lists \"Active Lunar Stations\" accessible from \"Starport Seventy-Five\" (the fictional setting for Space Mountain). In addition to science fiction and Disney-inspired names, the third entry reads, \"TRNQ-ARMSTRONG Interplanetary.\"\n\n\n\nIf not obvious, this is a tribute to Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong, who was the first person to walk on the moon at Tranquility Base in 1969.\n\n\n\n(In 2005, the real Armstrong helped re-open Space Mountain at Disneyland after it underwent two years of renovations.)\n\n\n\n5. Space (Race) Mountain\n\n\n\nThe festivities marking the opening of Space Mountain was not the only time that real space travelers met at the fictional starport. Less than a month later, the attraction became the rendezvous point for two crews set to shake hands in orbit.\n\n\n\nIn 1975, the space race between the United States and Russia had all but come to a close (the moon's surface being the finish line) but the two countries were still Cold War rivals. So it was a big deal when astronauts and cosmonauts came together during the first joint American and Russian space mission in July 1975.\n\n\n\nFive months before they launched into space, the five members of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) visited Walt Disney World, where they rode the newly-debuted Space Mountain. The Feb. 9, 1975 visit by NASA astronauts Thomas Stafford, Vance Brand and Deke Slayton and Russian cosmonauts Alexei Leonov and Valery Kubasov was a chance for both crews to relax and generate some publicity before the Russians reported for their last training session in Houston.\n\n\n\nStill laughing soon after getting off Space Mountain, Leonov described the ride as \"a real nice integrated simulator\" for their upcoming mission.\n\n\n\nNASA astronauts joined a spacesuited Mickey Mouse for the grand opening of Space Mountain in Tomorrowland at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida on Jan. 15, 1975. (Disney)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo design the support structure that would hold Space Mountain's dual tracks, Imagineers turned to NASTRAN, NASA software used to \"fly\" air and spacecraft before committing to a design.

The entertainment giant is expected to announce its fiscal first-quarter earnings for 2025 before the market opens on Wednesday, Feb. 5.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect DIS to report a profit of $1.45 per share on a diluted basis, up 18.9% from $1.22 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect DIS to report EPS of $5.41, up 8.9% from $4.97 in fiscal 2024. Its EPS is expected to rise 13.3% year over year to $6.13 in fiscal 2026.\n\nDIS stock has underperformed the S&P 500\u2019s ($SPX) 22.1% gains over the past 52 weeks, with shares up 19.7% during this period. Similarly, it underperformed the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund\u2019s (XLC) 29.4% gains over the same time frame.\n\nDisney's underperformance in recent years can be attributed to challenges in its pivot to streaming, as well as a decline in its legacy media business.

As tons of closure, refurbishments, and other new and upcoming attractions at Walt Disney will be taking place, it\u2019s a time of great change through bright visions of the future. Today is a special day to celebrate and contemplate this wave, as Space Mountain is celebrating a major milestone. Amid that, though, I must politely reiterate a bone I have to pick with this legendary attraction.\n\nHappy 50th Anniversary, Space Mountain!\n\nAs celebrated in a recent video, Space Mountain has hit its 50th year of operation. The January 15, 1975 debut of the Magic Kingdom\u2019s iconic mountain-based roller coaster is one of those occasions you just have to celebrate, whether you favor the ride or not.\n\nWith that in mind, please take a look at this video put together by Disney Parks, which has brought together some special guests to tip their mouse ears in tribute:\n\nSpace Mountain's 50th Anniversary at Walt Disney World Resort - YouTube Watch On\n\nThis video kind of makes it harder for me to discuss Space Mountain\u2019s drawbacks, as I don\u2019t want anyone to think I\u2019m picking a fight at someone\u2019s hypothetical birthday party. Plus, it's sweet seeing friendly Disney fans/performers like Sofia Carson, Jorge Blanco and Josh Gad all sharing their love for this legacy adventure to the stars. Gad\u2019s past viral Disney Parks moments in particular put a bit of pressure on me, as he\u2019s definitely a superfan.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m somewhat of a respectably obsessed Disney Adult, and I know that our crowd isn\u2019t shy about pushing back. People have fought for Figment to return to Journey Into The Imagination, demanded that Disneyland bring back its Peoplemover, and hoped for GotG: Cosmic Rewind\u2019s virtual queue to go away for good. With the spirit of those concerns in mind, here\u2019s why I still hold a grudge with Space Mountain, on this the day of its 50th anniversary.\n\n(Image credit: Disney Parks)\n\nWhy I'm Still Very Critical About Space Mountain's Future\n\nAfter riding the Tron Lightcycle Run during the 2023 press event at the Magic Kingdom, I revisited a lot of attractions I hadn\u2019t been on in 20 years; if at all. Just as I discovered the joys of Mission Space, I also developed concerns over Space Mountain\u2019s current state. More specifically, I wanted to see the ride either refurbished or removed entirely, thanks to Sam Flynn\u2019s amazing scientific achievement seeming to make this park fixture redundant.\n\nThat being said, my grudge does come with a spark of optimism, because Disney fans can be pretty good at flipping between the negative and the positive. Much as we\u2019ve seen with Tokyo Disneyland\u2019s massive Tomorrowland overhaul plans, Space Mountain is undergoing a much needed transformation that fits the mission of this Disney Land\u2019s concept. Keeping pace with current visions of the future, while also celebrating those of the past, this is a lesson all other Disney Parks could stand to take to heart.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n(Image credit: Walt Disney World)\n\nAs Space Mountain celebrates 50 years of spacefaring cheer, we should remember that this achievement is something that hasn\u2019t happened by accident. People do love this ride, and I do have fond memories of enjoying it myself. At the same time, we\u2019re about to see new lands and fresh attractions debuting throughout Walt Disney World.\n\nThe currently closure and refresh of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad only puts a beautiful spire on top of the grand scheme of this conversation. If we\u2019re going to get serious about its potential future, it needs more than just an exterior update to keep it in the conversation. So, while I celebrate Space Mountain's 50th lap around this galaxy's sun, I continue to hope that it'll get to grow and flourish for future generations.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable to feel nostalgic after all of this chatter, especially if you\u2019re reading this while preparing for/currently enjoying this Orlando destination. So, if you\u2019re able, you should take this as your sign to go ride Space Mountain at the Magic Kingdom and form your own conclusions.",

            "content": "Fifty years ago this week, Space Mountain launched at Walt Disney World Resort, forever transforming the world of theme park attractions. What began as a singular ride in Florida would inspire a global phenomenon, expanding across Disney parks worldwide, from Disneyland Resort to Tokyo Disney Resort and beyond. As we commemorate this momentous anniversary, it\u2019s clear that Space Mountain\u2019s legacy is more than just a thrilling ride; it\u2019s a cultural milestone that has evolved over generations.\n\nFrom One Mountain to Another\n\nSpace Mountain\u2019s creation journey started decades before it became an icon. The spark for the concept came from an unlikely source: the Matterhorn Mountain in Switzerland. In 1958, Walt Disney visited the peak and, struck by its beauty, sent a postcard to his Imagineers with a simple instruction: \u201cBUILD THIS.\u201d The result was the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland, which opened in 1959 as the first-ever tubular steel track roller coaster, featuring sharp turns and caverns unlike anything seen in a theme park before.\n\nWalt didn\u2019t stop at just one mountain. Inspired by the success of the Matterhorn, he envisioned another attraction, this time set in the far reaches of space. This idea eventually evolved into Space Mountain, a thrilling ride that would take guests on an interstellar adventure. The project required groundbreaking technology and a fresh architectural approach, which Disney Legend John Hench provided. Hench designed a striking conical dome and external steel beams, symbolizing energy dispersal. However, the technology required to bring Walt\u2019s ambitious vision to life wasn\u2019t quite ready in the early \u201970s.\n\nThe Cosmic Journey Begins\n\nAfter the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971, Imagineers began work on the Florida version of Space Mountain. It was a monumental challenge\u2014both technically and creatively\u2014but they persisted, knowing that computers would eventually provide the tools necessary to build the attraction. When Space Mountain opened in Magic Kingdom on January 15, 1975, it marked a new era for Disney parks. For the first time, guests would race through space on a roller coaster-style ride, with unexpected twists and turns that simulated the sensation of shooting through the stars. It quickly became a must-see attraction, and for many, it was their first real experience with an indoor coaster.\n\nSpace Mountain Expands to the West Coast\n\nFollowing the success of the Magic Kingdom version, Disneyland Resort in Anaheim introduced its version of Space Mountain in 1977. This version featured a few differences, such as a single track rather than the two used in Florida and larger trains to accommodate more guests. Nevertheless, it became just as beloved by Disneyland visitors, further cementing Space Mountain\u2019s status as a Disney classic.\n\nSpace Mountain Goes Global\n\nSpace Mountain didn\u2019t stay confined to U.S. borders for long. Disney\u2019s first international park, Tokyo Disneyland, opened in 1983, and Space Mountain traveled overseas. The Tokyo version was nearly identical to the one in Anaheim, and it quickly became a fan favorite among Japanese guests.\n\nBut as Disney expanded its global footprint, Imagineers were determined to make Space Mountain feel fresh at each new park. When Disneyland Paris opened in 1992, the concept for Space Mountain was reimagined to fit the park\u2019s unique theme of \u201cDiscoveryland.\u201d This version of the ride, called Space Mountain: de la Terre \u00e0 la Lune, was inspired by Jules Verne\u2019s From the Earth to the Moon and featured a cannon launch system to propel guests into space. This new design included a faster ride, a thrilling upside-down loop, and an onboard audio system synchronizing music with the ride\u2019s movements. It was a technological leap forward and demonstrated Disney\u2019s commitment to innovation.\n\nThe Next Frontier: Space Mountain and Beyond\n\nAs Disney expanded to new parks, Space Mountain continued to evolve. In Hong Kong Disneyland, the attraction received its version, and as of 2025, Hyperspace Mountain\u2014a Star Wars-themed overlay\u2014will return to Disneyland for its \u201cSeason of the Force.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Tokyo Disneyland will debut a reimagined version of Space Mountain in 2027, incorporating new technology and effects to deepen the experience. Meanwhile, Disney\u2019s Shanghai resort took a bold step in 2016 with the TRON Lightcycle Power Run. This futuristic roller coaster blends the classic thrills of Space Mountain with cutting-edge technology.\n\nNow, as we celebrate 50 years of Space Mountain at Walt Disney World, it\u2019s clear that this attraction isn\u2019t just a ride; it\u2019s a legacy. Space Mountain revolutionized theme park design and paved the way for many of the coasters and experiences we love today. It\u2019s a reminder that imagination has no bounds in the world of Disney\u2014whether it\u2019s soaring through space or racing through the grid.\n\nDo you remember your first ride on Space Mountain?",

            "content": "I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that I\u2019m a Disney adult. In fact, my husband and I are such fans that we had our honeymoon at Disney World. Seven years later, we still remember it as the best week of our lives. So naturally, we\u2019ve been dreaming of taking our kids back to the happiest place on earth since before they were even born.\n\nHowever, once I became a mom and had the inevitable realization that kids are hard AF, that dream trip seemed light years away. There was just no way I could face Disney World with Toddlers and have a good time\u2026 right?\n\nWell, earlier this year, my family got the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be hosted by Walt Disney World, stay at one of their incredible resorts, and visit all four Disney parks. My prior belief that Disney World with toddlers wasn\u2019t doable flew out the window, and we immediately said yes.\n\nHowever, shortly after accepting their offer, reality sunk in. Our kids had never traveled anywhere at all, and I was fully aware of how much work it would be. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if it was even worth taking a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old to Disney World.\n\nPeople argue it\u2019s not worth the hassle because kids that age won\u2019t remember the experience. But does that mean parents should skip doing anything fun during the first five years of their kid\u2019s life? Obviously not. Making fun memories as parents are just as important IMO.\n\nSo I put my big girl pants on, did the research, and armed myself with the right information (and supplies) to make this the best trip possible. And now that we\u2019re back, I can answer the million-dollar question. Yes, Disney World with toddlers was stressful at times, but it was still 100 percent worth it. If you want to know how to make the most out of your vacation, then buckle up. Here\u2019s everything I learned during our trip to Disney World with two toddlers:\n\nSource: Steph Alleva Cornell Source: Steph Alleva Cornell\n\nOur Disney World Itinerary With Toddlers\n\nFirst and foremost, our itinerary. We stayed four days and three nights at Disney\u2019s Art of Animation Resort and visited one park each day. We flew in early on the first day and flew out in the afternoon of our fourth day, so two of our park days were shorter than the others. But it worked out because the parks we went to during our longer days had more rides and activities for younger kids (I\u2019ll touch more on that later).\n\nDay One : Took the Mears Connect shuttle from the airport to the resort, checked into Art of Animation Resort, and spent the afternoon at Epcot\n\n: Took the Mears Connect shuttle from the airport to the resort, checked into Art of Animation Resort, and spent the afternoon at Epcot Day Two : Full day at Magic Kingdom\n\n: Full day at Magic Kingdom Day Three: Full day at Hollywood Studios\n\nFull day at Hollywood Studios Day Four: Spent the morning at Animal Kingdom then shuttled back to the airport from the resort\n\nPerks for Toddlers at Disney World\n\nI did hours of research to ensure that we utilized every accommodation available when we arrived at Disney World. Yes, traveling with toddlers has its rough moments, but they offer so many perks for small kids.\n\nMost importantly, kids under 3 get free admission to every Disney park . If you visit all four parks, that\u2019s about $700 in savings right there.\n\n\n\n. If you visit all four parks, that\u2019s about $700 in savings right there. Kids under 3 can dine for free at family-style and buffet restaurants and some fine/signature restaurants if they eat off your plate. But they do charge for kid\u2019s meals to be clear.\n\n\n\nBut they do charge for kid\u2019s meals to be clear. If your family chooses to pay for Lightning Lane Passes (replacing Genie+ after July 24, 2024), you don\u2019t need to pay for the pass for kids under 3 . They\u2019ll be able to access the Lightning Lanes with you.\n\n\n\n. They\u2019ll be able to access the Lightning Lanes with you. Every Disney park has a baby care center that is fully staffed and offers tons of amenities for infants and toddlers. They\u2019re complimentary to use and include private nursing rooms, changing rooms with tables, restrooms, feeding areas with highchairs, full kitchens, and a shop with formula, baby food, diapers, and way more.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re complimentary to use and include private nursing rooms, changing rooms with tables, restrooms, feeding areas with highchairs, full kitchens, and a shop with formula, baby food, diapers, and way more.

Disney allows you to bring snacks and personal water bottles within the parks so you don\u2019t have to worry about them getting hangry and needing to constantly buy snacks/drinks.\n\nSource: Steph Alleva Cornell Source: Steph Alleva Cornell\n\nStaying at a Kid-Friendly Disney World Resort Hotel\n\nI\u2019ll never have one bad thing to say about Disney World Resort Hotels. From our honeymoon experience at their Contemporary Resort (amazing for an adult-only vacay) to our recent stay at Art of Animation, they were both incredible. Art of Animation was the perfect resort for our Lightning McQueen-loving kids since we stayed in the Cars-themed area.\n\nThey also have themed courtyards and suites for The Little Mermaid, Finding Nemo, and The Lion King\u2014plus the largest pool and water park at any of their resorts. Seriously, the pools were so big that you could spend a whole day just in their water area. And if parents need a little drink to cool down, they can visit the poolside bar.\n\nThe lobby, gift shop, and huge food court are also decked out in all things Pixar and Disney animation, so kids are bound to see their favorite characters the moment they walk in. The food court served breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, featured five food shops with fresh food, and had a massive selection of snacks and toiletries to buy.\n\nEven though we brought a whole bag of snacks in our suitcase, we all know you can never have enough with toddlers, so I loved that we could restock whenever needed. They also accept dining plan cards, which is a big perk if you choose to purchase a Disney Dining Plan.\n\nEvery family has different priorities while on vacation, and for us, it was important to maintain a familiar routine during our stay. That meant not skipping our 2-year-old\u2019s midday naps and not pushing our usual bedtime more than an hour. Trekking through four theme parks is exhausting for anyone, no matter their age, so the more rest the kids got, the less likely they\u2019d be cranky.\n\nStaying at a Disney World Resort made keeping our toddler\u2019s routine incredibly easy because all the parks open half an hour early for resort guests (perfect for early-rising toddlers), and the on-site complimentary resort transportation got us back and forth from our suite for naps and bedtime very quickly.\n\nArt of Animation had buses and the Skyliner (our kids loved the Skyliner) within a five-minute walk from our room, and it took no more than 25 minutes to travel to each park. The Bob Revolution Flex 3.0 Double Stroller we rented from ScooterBug for about $95 total (so worth it) also fits on all the transportation with minimal issues.\n\nSource: Steph Alleva Cornell Source: Steph Alleva Cornell\n\nStaying in a Family Suite\n\nOur sleeping arrangements gave me the most anxiety since my kids had never traveled and slept anywhere but our home. But Art of Animation has family suites with super spacious accommodations for parties of up to six, and our suite was perfect for our sleeping situation. Our family suite had:\n\nA living space with a pull-out couch bed and TV\n\nA small kitchenette with a microwave and fridge within the living area\n\nA dining area with a dining table that transformed into an additional bed\n\nA full bathroom in the main living space\n\nOne primary bedroom with another full bathroom\n\nOur 2-year-old slept in the primary bedroom in a mini crib provided by the resort, our 3-year-old (who\u2019s nearly 4) slept in the bed in the dining area, and my husband and I slept in the pull-out bed in the living area where we could directly see our oldest.\n\nWe tried to keep the sleeping arrangements as similar to our home as possible, so we brought two sound machines for both of them. The resort\u2019s curtains were also super thick and kept the entire suite dark, which helped them both fall asleep faster (and stay asleep all night).\n\nSource: Steph Alleva Cornell Source: Steph Alleva Cornell\n\nExploring the Disney Parks with Small Kids\n\nOK, now for the good stuff. I\u2019m sure you want to know above all else, what Disney parks are actually worth taking a 2-year-old and 3-year-old to? All four Disney parks had plenty of rides, attractions, shows, and character experiences for toddles. Our favorite parks had more to do with my kids\u2019 specific interests than their ages.\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m a Disney adult raising two kids on the same movies I grew up with. So no matter what park we went to, they immediately recognized their favorites from Encanto, Frozen, Toy Story, Moana, and so much more.\n\nMy Toddlers\u2019 Favorite Disney World Attractions at Each Park\n\nWe spent the most time at Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios. They got to make more memories there, but they still had a blast at Animal Kingdom and Epcot as well. These were the rides, attractions, and dining experiences that they still talk about months later:\n\nEpcot (half-day) Anna, Elsa, and Olaf character experience at Royal Sommerhus Journey of Water, Inspired by Moana\n\n\n\n(half-day) Magic Kingdom Mickey and Minnie character experience Princess Tiana character experience Buzz Lightyear\u2019s Space Ranger Spin Mad Tea Party Monster\u2019s Inc. Laugh Floor Lunch at Beauty and the Beast\u2019s Castle Dumbo the Flying Elephant The Magic Carpets of Aladdin\n\n\n\nThere are so many more toddler-friendly rides and attractions in Magic Kingdom we didn\u2019t get to, but will be on our list for next time. Under the Sea\u2014Journey of The Little Mermaid, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Peter Pan\u2019s Flight, It\u2019s a Small World, Prince Charming Regal Carrousel, Enchanted Tales With Belle, and Mickey\u2019s PhilharMagic.\n\nHollywood Studios Walking through Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge (they loved everything here!) Mandalorian and Grogu character experience Darth Vader character experience Toy Story Land Slinky Dog Dash (only our oldest could ride this, but he rode twice!) Alien Swirling Saucers Everything at Toy Story Mania Lunch at Hollywood and Vine with Minnie, Mickey, Goofy, and Pluto Frozen Sing-Along Celebration Fantasmic! (this show is a bit intense for little kids, but they both still really enjoyed it) Disney Junior Play and Dance!\n\n\n\nAnimal Kingdom (half-day) Carnival games at DinoLand U.S.A. TriceraTop Spin The Boneyard (super fun dino-themed playground!) Walking through Pandora\u2014The World of Avatar Lunch at Satu\u2019li Canteen\n\n(half-day)\n\nSource: Steph Alleva Cornell Source: Steph Alleva Cornell\n\nOur Park Day Itinerary\n\nOn the first day, our flight arrived at 2:00 p.m., so we didn\u2019t get a ton of time to explore Epcot. But after checking in and freshening up, we arrived at the park around 4:00 p.m. and stayed until 7:00 p.m.\n\nThe kids were definitely more cranky that day. We opted for a good night\u2019s sleep to better prepare for the next day. My littles don\u2019t sleep in (ever lol), so we were up and ready every day by 7:30 a.m. We made it just in time for rope drop at each park the next three days.\n\nSince we were up so early, we had enough time to explore and ride before my youngest started getting tired close to naptime. Thanks to the resort transportation, we were back in our suite by 12:30 P.M. on days two and three. While our 2-year-old napped, our oldest had fun at the resort with dad.\n\nWe made it back to the parks by 3:00 p.m. and stayed until 7:30-8:30 p.m. (we stayed later on our third day at Hollywood Studios to watch Fantasmic!). On our last day, we left Animal Kingdom to catch our airport shuttle by 11:30 a.m.\n\nMaximizing Our Experience With the My Disney Experiences App\n\nAnd lastly, the real MVP of our Disney parks experience was the My Disney Experiences app. We used the app during our honeymoon seven years ago. We loved it then, and left this trip loving the app even more now. It has absolutely everything you need from your park tickets, room key access, directions to everything in the parks and resorts, wait times for rides and attractions, and even mobile food ordering at certain dining areas.\n\nThe app made navigating the parks an absolute breeze, especially with two small kids. Toddlers are notoriously impatient, and with the app, we were able to avoid rides with longer lines and prioritize which attractions to use our Lightning Lane passes for.\n\nGuests staying at Disney hotels will be able to purchase Lightning Lane Passes seven days before their Disney trip. This allows guests to select up to three Lightening Lane entrances per day. Our 2-year-old technically didn\u2019t need one to join the Lightning Lane (another plus!). That helped us make the most out of each day.\n\nWhat I\u2019d Do Differently With Toddlers at Disney\n\nLooking back, I would\u2019ve loved to have more time at Animal Kingdom. We only got to explore two areas in Animal Kingdom before we left. We missed out on a few shows I really wanted my kids to experience (like Festival of the Lion King and Kilimanjaro Safari). It\u2019s worth staying an extra night in order to get a full day there.\n\nOne thing I will definitely do when we return is bring their grandparents. Not only would they have loved to experience it all with us, but it also would\u2019ve been lovely to have another (couple) set of hands to help out. Disney World with toddlers is absolutely doable without extra adults. But, it\u2019s also such a huge milestone vacation that\u2019s even better when shared with a group of loved ones.\n\nSource: Steph Alleva Cornell\n\nWhat I Loved Most About Taking My Toddlers to Disney World\n\nThe best thing about toddlers is that even the littlest things are so very magical to them. When Disney World brings all that movie magic to life, toddlers soak it in wholeheartedly. Every ride was euphoric, every character they met was real, and every show they watched brought their imaginations to life.\n\nYes, they had their fair share of tantrums due to overstimulation and tiredness (it\u2019s unavoidable at their age, unfortunately). But their absolute awe and pure joy made up for those moments tenfold. Regardless of whether they remember it or not, visiting Disney World with my toddlers was an experience I\u2019ll always cherish.",

He was featured in a documentary, \u201cFloyd Norman: An Animated Life\u201d in 2016.\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK. FOLLOW US ON TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM\n\nNorman was born June 22, 1935 in Santa Barbara, Calif., a far cry from the Jim Crow South that he experienced later as a boy. Without the overt racism that was prevalent throughout much of America at the time, Norman grew up in a relatively sheltered environment which fueled his imagination.\n\nRELATED: The 25 Most Influential Black Women In Business\n\nRELATED: Black History Month: Best in Black\n\nIn 1956, Norman received a big break in his career when Disney hired him as a part-time animator when he was just 21. Prior to this, Norman worked as a cartoonist\u2019s assistant. The first film Norman worked on was \u201cSleeping Beauty,\u201d released in 1959. Other early works that employed Norman\u2019s expertise was the original \u201cJungle Book,\u201d \u201c101 Dalmatians\u201d and other smaller films.\n\nIn past interviews, Norman defended the notoriously picky and hands-on Disney, saying that they never once fretted about Norman\u2019s race. The studio was especially patient with Norman, who originally applied to work there fresh out of high school. The company plucked Norman out of the Art Center College of Design and the rest was history.\n\nIn 1966, Norman and his partner Ron Sullivan formed Vignette Films and worked on a series of projects including the original 1969 \u201cFat Albert\u201d special, the animated Soul Train logo and many other projects. The film studio was the among the first to produce pieces on Black history for children. In 1999, Norman and Sullivan created the website, Afro Kids.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER:\n\nClose Thank you for subscribing!

Norman\u2019s second wife, Adrienne Brown-Norman, is still a Disney employee and Norman drives her into work everyday as he has for the past 15 years.\n\nThis year, Norman was added to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u2019 education and outreach committee. He is also the recipient of the 2002 Winsor McCay Award and the 2007 Disney Legend award, among other honors.\n\nAccording to reviews of the documentary, the film highlights the troubles Norman\u2019s work obsession caused his first marriage and their children. The documentary, \u201cFloyd Norman: An Animated Life,\u201d can be seen on demand on most streaming sites and on Blu-Ray.\n\nNorman paved the way for future Black Disney animators like Bruce Smith who did \u201c\u2018The Princess and the Frog\u201d and is the creator of \u201cThe Proud Family.\u201d\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK.

            "content": "I\u2019m a major Disney fan. I love the movies, the theme parks, and the Disney outfits. I even went to an info session about becoming a Disney Cast Member in college (although, I didn\u2019t follow through). I\u2019ve been lucky enough to visit Disney World as a kid, as a teen, as an adult, and as a mom. But planning a trip to Disney now requires much more thought and advanced organization than our trips to the parks as kids.\n\nTo help parents ready to plan their child\u2019s first Disney trip, we put together this list of hacks for planning a family vacation to Disney World. We talked to some other seasoned Disney experts, sourced the Disney Parks website, and gleaned tips from the many, many Disney Park blogs, Disney TikToks, and more to answer some of the common questions families may have about planning a trip to Disney World.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best age to take my child to Disney World? This question pops up in online mom groups all the time, and there\u2019s no right answer. Since I\u2019m a Disney fan, I say any age has its perks, but if you want a real answer, here it goes. If you have more than one child and are deciding when to take your family to Disney World for the first time, I think the best age is when your oldest is 5 or 6. Why? They will have memories of the trip, are tall enough to ride most of the rides, and the Disney characters and attractions seems extra magical. Additionally, you won\u2019t feel as bad if you pull them out of school to avoid peak travel times (and cost). If you\u2019re planning a Disney trip with your baby or toddler, it\u2019s true they may not remember much from the trip, but they will be in the pictures, their tickets are free (if they\u2019re under 3), and they will be part of your memories of the trip. Plus, toddlers have a magical quality us older folks sometimes forget\u2014being present. Their squeals of delight when they spot their favorite character or sail into the sky on Dumbo the Flying Elephant may not make it into their core memory bank, but you\u2019ll know they\u2019re having fun in the moment. Other age considerations for Disney World trip planning: Disney park tickets for children under 3 are free .\n\n. Many rides don\u2019t have a height limit , but if your child is over 40 inches, they can go on most rides. My 4-year-old just made the cut.\n\n, but if your child is over 40 inches, they can go on most rides. My 4-year-old just made the cut. Even if your child meets the height requirement, you\u2019ll want to consider the fear factor of certain rides and know that many attractions are in the dark.\n\nof certain rides and know that many attractions are in the dark.

Indoor rides, shows, and restaurants can double as air-conditioned nursing spots. And each park offers plenty of shaded benches.\n\nwith rocking chairs for nursing and extra essentials for purchase (at normal prices) in case you\u2019re dealing with an unexpected blow-out or running out of wipes. Indoor rides, shows, and restaurants can double as air-conditioned nursing spots. And each park offers plenty of shaded benches. You can find childcare at Disney with a theme park nanny who can watch your child at your hotel or help at the parks if you want some kid-free time on your Disney vacation.\n\nWhen is the best time of the year to visit Disney World?\n\nThe best time is hard to pinpoint, but the best time to not go to Disney World? During a school break\u2014especially for your first trip. Holiday breaks and spring breaks are considered \u201cpeak times\u201d when your trip will be more expensive and the parks will be more crowded. Disney often offers hotel and ticket discount packages during off-peak times, which can save you money as well. Check out the Disney World crowd calendar for other less-crowded times to visit.\n\nHow far in advance should I plan my Disney trip?\n\nYou\u2019ll want to book your Disney trip a minimum of 60 days in advance. Hotel reservations book up, so the more time you can give yourself, the better. Plus, all guests staying in a Disney hotel can book their dining reservations before guests staying off-property: 60 days before the trip. And Disney resort guests can book their Lightning Lanes 7 days in advance vs. 3 days in advance if staying off-property.\n\nIf you have a restaurant you want to visit or an attraction on your must-do list, set your alarm for the morning so you can first book selections at 7 a.m. Eastern Time. For example, character meals fill up quickly and can be a great way to meet some of your children\u2019s favorite Disney characters without waiting in line at the parks.\n\nShould I stay at a Disney Resort hotel? Staying in a hotel on Walt Disney World property has a lot of perks. Not only are you closer to the attractions\u2014meaning you can maximize your time at Disney or head back to the hotel for naptime\u2014but Disney hotels are an extension of the storytelling and detail from the parks. Disney offers hotels at varying price points and many accommodations offer condo-like rooms with kitchens, which can be convenient for families with younger kids. Additional benefits of staying on-site vs. off-property at Disney include; In 2025, Disney Resort hotel guests can enjoy water park admission on check-in day \u2014included with your stay\u2014so consider getting an early flight and jump right into the fun!\n\n\u2014included with your stay\u2014so consider getting an early flight and jump right into the fun!

Free parking at the parks if you choose to drive. Of course, you can still have a magical vacation staying off the Disney property. And if you only plan to visit the park one or two days, it may make more financial sense to stay in a nearby resort or rental house. But if you\u2019re going for the full \u201cDisney experience,\u201d and it\u2019s within your budget, I think the extra cost of a Disney hotel is worth it.\n\nWhat type of Disney park pass should I purchase?\n\nTheme Park Reservations\n\nDisney parks have capacity restrictions, so to ensure you\u2019re able to visit the park you want to on a given day, you\u2019ll want to check the Disney Parks availability calendar here before purchasing tickets. You\u2019ll also need to make a reservation for the park you\u2019ll be visiting.\n\nPark Hopper vs. Single Day Disney Tickets\n\nAdditionally, when considering theme park tickets, the price per day goes down the more days you plan to visit. And although more expensive, the Park Hopper ticket option offers more flexibility if you want to visit more than one park in a day. For example, one park could be inexplicably more crowded or the ride at the top of your list could be unexpectedly shut down, and the Park Hopper allows you to switch parks and maximize your day.\n\nIf you\u2019re opting for one park, and one park only, The Magic Kingdom has the most attractions for young children so a single-day ticket might be best.\n\nShould I buy Disney Magic Bands?\n\nAll your ticket information is saved in your My Disney Experience app, but Disney Magic Bands are wearable devices offered to guests staying at a Disney resort hotel. They are not only convenient, but they also link your park tickets, Lightning Lane selections, Advanced Dining Reservations, photos, and work as your hotel key. They can also be used to contact you if your child gets separated from you at the park (Disney Cast Members can scan your child\u2019s band and call the phone number associated with your reservation.)\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to visit Disney more than once, you can also reactivate an old band, so you don\u2019t need to purchase one for each visit.\n\nHow do you skip the long lines? What to know about Lightning Lanes\n\nTraveling at an \u201coff-peak\u201d time will minimize your Disney wait times, but there are plenty of other ways to make sure your visit isn\u2019t just spent in lines.\n\nIf you\u2019re really into Disney park strategy, you can go pretty deep into tips on Disney TikTok, Disney Facebook Groups, and Disney travel blogs to maximize your days. There are even 3rd party apps that claim to get you booked for your favorite rides or find open reservations (but do your research, they\u2019re not run by Disney).\n\nYes, it\u2019s a lot to manage, but going in with a plan\u2014and a backup plan\u2014will help ensure a fun day at the park(s). Here\u2019s more info on avoiding long lines at Disney World.\n\nDownload the Disney MyExperience App\n\nDisney\u2019s app houses everything you need for planning and navigating your days. Be sure to download it to link your park passes, connect all members of your party, check wait times, manage dining reservations and Lightning Lane Passes (more on that below), and more.\n\nLightning Lane Multi Pass vs. Lightning Lane Single Pass vs. Lightning Lane Premier Pass\n\nFor a bit of Disney park history, guests were previously able to make Fast Pass and Fast Pass+ reservations in advance for their favorite attractions\u2014at no charge. The pandemic saw the end of Fast Passes and the beginning, Genie, Genie+, and Individual Lightning Lanes\u2014the latter two being paid options. Then in 2024, Genie+ was replaced by Lightning Lane Multi Pass\u2014a paid option to skip standby lines on a select number of attractions which can be purchased in advance of your trip.\n\nFeeling confused and a little frustrated at the extra charges? Even as a frequent Disney World visitor, the changing policies and increasing costs are starting to get to me. But the Disney magic still calls, here\u2019s what to know when considering Lightning Lane Passes.\n\nLightning Lane Multi-Pass\n\nWith Lightning Lane Multi-Pass, you can pay an extra cost per person to skip the standby line for about 50 experiences throughout the parks (see the list of attractions here). The attractions are tiered based on popularity, and the cost varies by day and park, but you can estimate spending an extra $32-39/day per person.\n\nLightning Lane Single Pass\n\nFor the top 1-2 attractions at each park, guests can also purchase an individual Lightning Lane Single Pass. Again, the cost varies based on park and time of year. For example, during peak Spring Break in 2024, my family paid $12/each for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train at Magic Kingdom, but paid almost $30/each to ride Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Hollywood Studios. If you don\u2019t want to spend the extra on these attractions, they are good candidates for \u201crope drop\u201d (more on that below!)\n\nLightning Lane Premier Pass\n\nThe priciest option is the new Lightning Lane Premier Pass which allows one-time entry to each Lightning Lane experience in a theme park\u2014to enjoy at your leisure that day. Disney is currently piloting this program and it is only available for Disney resort hotel guests.\n\nHow expensive is this option? It varies by park and time of year, but you\u2019re looking at an incremental cost of anywhere between $129-400 per guest. Magic Kingdom is the most expensive, followed by Hollywood Studios, Epcot, and then Animal Kingdom. For families with many top-tier attractions on their list, this option could make sense if it\u2019s within their budget.\n\nWhat is \u201cRope Drop\u201d?\n\nIf you\u2019re able to arrive at the park right when it opens (AKA \u201crope drop\u201d), you can usually squeeze in a popular attraction before the park fills up and the lines get longer. For guests staying at a Disney resort hotel, this means 30 minutes before guests who are not staying on property. For example, on my family\u2019s most recent Disney trip, we didn\u2019t want to pay for the Lightning Lane for Avatar: Flight of Passage at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom (the cost would have added over $100 to our day), so we pulled into the parking lot at 6:55 a.m and were riding my daughter\u2019s number one attraction by 7:40 a.m.\u2014well before many guests were even allowed access to the park.\n\nShould I buy the Disney Dining Plan?\n\nAnother change that came to Disney World in 2024 is the return of the Disney Dining Plan. Walt Disney World Resort guests can choose from two dining packages based on their preferences. The Disney Dining Plan acts as a pre-paid meal packaging, where you can purchase \u201ccredits\u201d that can be used at Table-Service or Quick-Service dining at Disney World. Keep in mind that some popular experiences like character and fine dining require multiple meal credits. You know your family best, so determining if the Disney Dining Plan is worth it will depend on your family\u2019s plans and preferences.\n\nShould I bring a stroller to Disney World?\n\nYou will be walking a lot, so a stroller is nice to have. Disney is very accessible, with stroller parking for every ride and a stroller can double as a nap spot. Many Disney families I know rent strollers for their kids up until they\u2019re 6 or 7 years old. That way, they don\u2019t end up carrying a heavy, sleeping kiddo home after the fireworks.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to bring your own stroller or purchase a travel stroller, services will deliver a high-quality stroller right to your hotel\u2014which is less expensive than renting inside the theme park and you won\u2019t have to wait in another line. Opt for a stroller that reclines and has plenty of shade.\n\nShould I use a Disney Vacation planner?\n\nIf this all feels like a lot, it is! From the endless options to the ever-evolving technology, some parents may want to call in the experts. A Disney Vacation planner can help streamline the process. Otherwise, calling Disney directly or chatting through their website will connect you to a Cast Member happy to help you plan.",

            "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established The Walt Disney Company ( ). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth of 18% on the NYSE over the last few months. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s examine Walt Disney\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Is Walt Disney Worth?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 12% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Walt Disney today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $123.42, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Walt Disney\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Walt Disney generate?\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Walt Disney. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? DIS\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on DIS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

            "content": "A lawsuit has been filed against Disney over claims that Walt Disney Animation Studios lifted elements of another project pitch to create Moana and the recent sequel Moana 2. Claimant Buck Woodall is seeking at least $10 billion in damages, saying that materials created for his original project Bucky were coopted by the entertainment giant.\n\nThe suit states that Woodall produced a screenplay and trailer for Bucky and shared details of the project with Jenny Marchick, then the director of development for Mandeville Films, in 2003, when the studio had a first-look deal with Disney. Marchick, who is now head of feature film development at DreamWorks Animation, allegedly requested additional materials including character designs, storyboards and production plans in a bid to greenlight the film.\n\nThe complaint reads: \u201cDisney\u2019s Moana was produced in the wake of Woodall\u2019s delivery to the Defendants of virtually all constituent parts necessary for its development and production after more than 17 years of inspiration and work on his animated film project.\u201d\n\nThe similarities which the suit puts \u201ccould not possibly have been accidental\u201d between Bucky and 2016\u2019s Moana include the key plot following a teenager who sets off on a dangerous voyage in Polynesian waters to save an endangered island, as well as recurring themes based on Polynesian beliefs (particularly the incarnation of spiritual ancestors as animals), a plot involving a necklace, a protagonist encountering a tattooed demigod toting a giant fish hook, and a giant creature inside a mountain.\n\nThe plaintiff also alleges similarities between his original project and Moana 2, pointing out the sequence where Moana\u2019s crew are sucked into a watery portal, described as \u201canother dramatic and unique device-imagery found in plaintiff\u2019s materials that could not possibly have been developed by chance or without malicious intentions.\u201d\n\nWoodall had previously attempted to sue over the issue, but a U.S. district judge ruled in November last year that the suit had been filed too late. The release of the sequel sparked an opportunity to try again.\n\nRon Clements, a Disney veteran who directed (with John Musker and Don Hall) and wrote (with Jared Bush and Musker) Moana, said in a court statement pertaining to the first suit: \u201cMoana was not inspired by or based in any way on [Woodall] or his Bucky project, which I learned of for the first time after this lawsuit was filed.\u201d\n\nSo far, Moana 2 has earned over $990 million in box office worldwide. The first film grossed $643.3M and received Oscar nominations for Best Animate Feature and Best Original Song. The franchise has also spawned major consumer products programs.\n\n[Sources: Sky News, The Hollywood Reporter]",

For its dedication to fostering a future of academic and professional success for our nation\u2019s heroes, Disney was honored with the Daniel J. Edelman Corporate Champion of the Year award from Student Veterans of America (SVA).\n\nAdmiration for military service members, veterans and their families is an integral part of Disney\u2019s history, which began with the company\u2019s founders Walt and Roy O. Disney, who both served their country during the First World War.\n\nDisney continues this legacy today, through impactful relationships with organizations like Student Veterans of America (SVA), a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that student veterans and military-connected students achieve their greatest potential.\n\nSVA\u2019s Corporate Champion of the Year\n\nThe award, given at the 2025 SVA National Conference, marked the culmination of more than a decade of collaboration to help the next generation of veteran leaders flourish. Disney, one of SVA\u2019s longest continuous supporters, previously received this distinguished honor in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply honored by this recognition and cherish our longstanding partnership with Student Veterans of America,\u201d said Tinisha Agramonte, SVP, Chief Diversity Officer, The Walt Disney Company. \u201cDisney has a proud history of honoring and supporting those who serve. We know how important it is to give back, support, and enrich the military community. It is our privilege to contribute to the success of student veterans as they embark on meaningful new chapters after their service to our nation.\u201d\n\n(Photo credit: Student Veterans of America)\n\nThe company\u2019s dedication to veterans continues with additional support for SVA, building upon Disney\u2019s $1 million grant as a founding sponsor of the SVA Career Center which empowers veterans with the tools and guidance they need to successfully transition into the civilian workforce.\n\n\u201cDisney has consistently demonstrated what it means to be a true champion for the military and veteran community,\u201d said Jared Lyon, president and CEO, Student Veterans of America. \u201cTheir steadfast collaboration, from becoming the Founding Sponsor of the SVA Career Center to making additional investments in its growth, has transformed the lives of countless student veterans. Through their support, Disney is helping us empower veterans to achieve their academic and career goals, paving the way for a brighter future for those who have served our nation.\u201d\n\nStanding Behind Those Who Serve\n\nIn the year since its founding, the SVA Career Center has helped provide student veterans with resources, support and advocacy to ensure they can effectively expand their skills and realize their full potential.\n\n(Photo credit: Student Veterans of America)\n\nJohn Arant, senior manager, Casting Services Recruitment, Disney Experiences, has spent the past year helping SVA transform their career center and job site to meet the evolving needs of student veterans.\n\n\u201cAs part of Disney\u2019s recruiting team and an Army veteran, I have ensured that Disney jobs are available to SVA members via their job board, allowing them to apply and learn about career paths at Disney,\u201d said Arant. \u201cThis collaboration has been tremendous and continues to demonstrate Disney\u2019s 100 years of service to our military, veterans and their families.\u201d\n\nThe online portal allows SVA members to connect with employers who value military service, refine their resumes, develop career strategies and more, all with the support and camaraderie of fellow veterans.\n\nU.S. Navy veteran Jamie Springston credits the SVA Career Center as being a valuable resource in his post-military career journey. He served as a Hospital Corpsman (Fleet Marine Force) attached to numerous Marine units in combat operations for seven years. While deployed in Afghanistan, he participated in more than 120 missions providing medical coverage.\n\nJamie began pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree at Marshall University in West Virginia following his military service and credits SVA with helping him find a community to support him as he navigated a difficult transition from the military. He later served as SVA chapter president until earning his degree in 2024.\n\n(Photo credit: Student Veterans of America)\n\nDiscovering the SVA Career Center was a pivotal moment. Jamie used its Career Pathways tool, which offered a holistic view of his military and civilian experiences, skills, education, and interests, to explore new possibilities. The suggested pathways opened his mind to future roles and how he could best position himself to be competitive.\n\n\u201cThe career center founded by Disney has been transformative,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cI\u2019m not the same person I was three years ago. It\u2019s helped me be better prepared to be competitive in securing a meaningful career following my military service.\u201d\n\n(Photo credit: Student Veterans of America)\n\nJamie especially valued the Center\u2019s job board, with real-time listings that gave him a practical sense of his options. He describes the SVA Career Center as the most valuable resource he\u2019s encountered in navigating his military and educational transitions, enabling him to consider new career directions with confidence and clarity.\n\nThe SVA career center coupled with mentorship from SVA student advisors helped Jamie prepare effectively for an interview and secure the role as a civil rights specialist with FEMA early in the process. He is enjoying his new role while also pursuing a master\u2019s degree in social work so he can continue to serve his community.\n\nContinuing Disney\u2019s Legacy of Support\n\nToday, Disney proudly salutes the thousands of U.S. military veterans who work in all areas of the company, recognizing their sacrifices while also continuing to support individuals who are transitioning to the civilian workforce at Disney and beyond.\n\nSince 2012, Disney has contributed more than $20 million in funding and media support to nonprofit organizations focused on bringing joy and happiness to veterans and military families. The company was also recognized as one of the top 25 companies who hire veterans on the 2024 Military Times \u201cBest for Vets\u201d Employers rankings.\n\nVeterans, military personnel and military spouses are invited to explore open opportunities and discover where a career with Disney may take them through the Heroes Work Here initiative launched in 2012.

Disney\u2019s worldview was an interesting blend of 19th-century morals with a 21st-century vision for science and technology. A futurist, Disney was given to techno-utopianism and his works tended to reflect this, but they have also offered warning messages about the dangers posed by both science and technology. John West explores these interests both in Disney\u2019s exhibits and his film works. Download the podcast or listen to it here.\n\nDig Deeper",

            "content": "It looks like the entertainment giant can have its proverbial cake and eat it too.\n\nIt's official. The Walt Disney Company (DIS 1.83%) intends to become 70% owner of streaming television outfit (and cable alternative) FuboTV (FUBO 7.80%). Disney's similar Hulu+Live service will, in turn, become part of FuboTV, although (for the time being anyway) the two brands will continue operating separately. Most notably, the deal also means Fubo will drop its efforts to prevent Walt Disney from co-launching a sports-centric streaming service in partnership with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery -- perhaps the ultimate goal of the negotiation.\n\nFubo will remain a publicly traded company, to be clear -- Disney will simply be its biggest shareholder, buying yet-to-be-issued stock within the next year and a half.\n\nOn the surface, it seems like a win-win. And in many regards, it is. Walt Disney can proceed with the debut of its sports-minded Venu platform, while FuboTV shareholders can bask in the 250% gain their stock experienced immediately after the announcement was made Monday morning. Some are saying the development may well have saved the tiny company since it also calls for much-needed funding from The Walt Disney Company.\n\nThe deal arguably favors Disney far more than it favors Fubo, though, for reasons that are being obscured by all the post-announcement noise.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company isn't buying -- it's setting the stage for a future sale\n\nAlthough it was cheered by most, the agreement is actually a bit unusual in light of Disney's other option. That's the outright acquisition of Fubo, which, at the time the agreement was announced, sported a market cap of less than $500 million. Even a 100% premium to last Friday's closing price would have still been affordable for deep-pocketed Disney, which has $6 billion worth of liquidity sitting on its balance sheet right now.\n\nDisney is also no stranger to the cable television business; its Hulu+Live platform very similarly delivers live network broadcasts and other cable TV content to 4.6 million subscribers versus FuboTV's more modest headcount of 1.6 million cable-alternative customers.\n\nHowever, what if The Walt Disney Company doesn't want to be in the cable television business any longer? What if the media giant would rather just focus on content creation and selling this content directly to consumers, bypassing the conventional cable industry?\n\nThat seems to be what Disney wants since that's exactly what this deal does.\n\nThat's not to suggest Walt Disney offloaded a lemon on Fubo at what will end up being a negligible cost. Hulu+Live is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)-profitable, and the combination of this business with FuboTV's similar cable alternative is expected to become even more profitable, operating under one umbrella. Perhaps Fubo will be able to do more with the well-recognized Hulu brand than Walt Disney ever managed to.\n\nThe cable business isn't exactly high-growth, though. Indeed, streaming alternatives to cable TV are increasingly running into the same headwinds as conventional cable. These, of course, are rising carriage fees in an environment where consumers are enjoying an increasing number of live-streaming options, and now, the prospect of streaming cable-like television being regulated like ordinary cable TV.\n\nIn many ways, the Walt Disney Company arguably just abandoned a sinking ship. Underscoring its disinterest in the business is the fact that -- despite being a majority owner -- Disney is allowing FuboTV's current management team to continue running the company.\n\nTo the extent that it still holds a stake in cable-like player FuboTV, it can afford to shed its 70% stake in the company at a loss at any point in the future. Even after the stock's recent run-up, Fubo's market cap remains less than $2 billion.\n\nLive sports will soon be available in all flavors, sizes, colors, and price points\n\nThe irony? Walt Disney itself may be the chief reason matters are about to go from bad to worse for the cable television business.\n\nIt's not the only reason consumers still pay sky-high monthly bills for cable TV, but according to numbers from CableTV.com, access to live sports is the top reason people are still paying for cable. Familiarity with how their cable TV service works is a close second reason. (The two reasons alone account for more than half of consumers' willingness to stick with cable.)\n\nChange is afoot on both fronts, however. Amazon Prime is now the exclusive carrier of Thursday nights' NFL matchups, for instance. Even Netflix is venturing into this territory with the near-exclusive airing of two Christmas day games.\n\nESPN remains the powerhouse of the sports TV business, of course. The sports-focused cable channel remains a staple of all major cable television plans, offering programming that isn't available anywhere else. Even that's about to change, though. The now-impending launch of Venu will include all the live sports broadcasts from Warner's TNT and TBS, Fox's Fox Sports and FS1, and perhaps most notably, everything ESPN offers, including its flagship cable channel's live broadcast.\n\nIf sports is indeed the chief reason people have yet to cut the cord, a wave of cord-cutting is building.\n\nThis wave will probably briefly reaccelerate later this year, too, by the way, when Disney plans to launch a stand-alone streaming version of ESPN that will even partially compete with Venu.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company no longer needs to care about the cable television industry's ever-growing challenges. It's now able to effectively monetize all of its big-ticket content in several other ways outside of cable's reach.\n\nFocus on the bigger, longer-term picture\n\nSo, now what? Presuming Fubo's shareholders and regulators approve the deal, there's nothing that shareholders of either company can or need to do. There's a case to be made for taking action with both stocks, though.\n\nFor Walt Disney shares, the already-bullish case just became even more bullish.\n\nAlthough the stock stumbled following news of the deal with FuboTV, this agreement solves a handful of near-term problems for Disney while also providing cost-effective choices further down the road. Namely, if it wants to get out of the streaming-cable business altogether, it can do so by selling the 70% stake in Fubo that it will soon be buying for little more than a song.\n\nAs for FuboTV, the stock's recent surge may be an opportunity for a profitable exit -- at least for part of any open positions.\n\nWhile the agreement is more or less solidified, the one detail that's missing so far is the price at which The Walt Disney Company is going to make its future purchase of its 70% stake in Fubo. It's presumably going to reflect Fubo stock's price nearer the time the deal closes, but there's no particular contractual reason FuboTV shares are guaranteed to remain at their current lofty levels. Indeed, given that this week's knee-jerk buying only unfurled based on the premise of the deal, there's a good chance Fubo stock is poised to peel back at least a little bit in the near future.",

            "content": "Universal Studios has a rich and storied history, but few moments are as peculiar\u2014and as hilariously cutting\u2014as the creation of Your Studio & You. This 14-minute parody film, commissioned in 1995 to celebrate Universal\u2019s new ownership under Seagram\u2019s, brings together an all-star cast, biting humor, and the unmistakable comedic fingerprints of Matt Stone and Trey Parker.\n\nLong before South Park debuted on Comedy Central in 1997, Stone and Parker were already carving out a reputation for their irreverent style, and Your Studio & You perfectly encapsulates their knack for turning even the most corporate project into something delightfully subversive.\n\nMatt Stone & Trey Parker Before South Park\n\nStone & Parker were already known out in Hollywood as funny guys. Thanks largely to \u201cThe Spirit of Christmas,\u201d which was this video greeting card that they\u2019d crafted for a Fox executive \u2013 who then distributed this infamously funny thing (which had Our Lord Jesus Christ & Santa Claus literally duking it out for the holiday affections of Cartman, Kenny, Stan & Kyle) to friends & family.\n\nThis was the early 1990s. No internet. Each copy of \u201cThe Spirit of Christmas\u201d was made on VHS tape and then mailed. Went viral the old-fashioned way. It\u2019s rumored that George Clooney made over 300 copies of \u201cThe Spirit of Christmas\u201d and passed these VHS taps along to friends and family.\n\nThings didn\u2019t move as fast as they do today. \u201cThe Spirit of Christmas\u201d still became a sensation out West.\n\nZucker Brothers\n\nMatt & Trey also had other supporters in the entertainment industry. Among them David Zucker, who was one of the members of ZAZ (i.e., Zucker Abrahams Zucker), the talented trio that made \u201cAirplane!\u201d in 1980, \u201cTop Secret!\u201d in 1984 and the three \u201cNaked Gun\u201d movies.\n\nThe original \u201cNaked Gun\u201d in 1988\n\n\u201cNaked Gun 2 & 1/2 : The Smell of Fear\u201d in 1991\n\nand \u201cNaked Gun 33 & a 1/3: The Final Insult\u201d in 1994\n\nAll five of these parody films had been made for Paramount Pictures. But in the Late Winter / Early Spring of 1995, Universal had persuaded the Zucker Brothers to come over and set up shop in a bungalow on their lower lot. With the hope that \u2013 at some point further on down the line \u2013 David & his brother Jerry would start making funny films for Universal.\n\nAnd it\u2019s during this same window of time (We\u2019re now talking April of 1995) that news breaks that Seagrams (Yep, the adult beverage company. Who \u2013 at the time \u2013 was making an absolute fortune on the sales of wine coolers) was about to buy a majority stake in MCAUniversal. We\u2019re talking control of 80% of that company\u2019s stock. Which would effectively make Seagrams the new owners of Universal Studios.\n\nEdgar Bronfman\n\nAnd Edgar Bronfman \u2013 the owner of Seagrams \u2013 knew that Universal had had a tough time with its previous owners \u2013 which had been the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan. Matsushita had bought MCA back in November of 1990 for $7.5 billion but had never really understood the entertainment industry.\n\nThis is why \u2013 after repeatedly butting heads with Lew Wasserman & Sidney Sheinberg (i.e., the heads of Universal Studios & the Universal theme park respectively) when it came to creative control of this company \u2013 Matsushita decided to wash it hands of the entire enterprise. Agreeing to sell their holdings in MCA to Seagrams for $5.7 billion (effectively taking a nearly $2 billion loss on this investment).\n\nAnd Bronfman \u2026 He knew that some bad feeling had developed between Hollywood\u2019s creative community and the Japanese owners of Universal. The thinking was that executives at Matsushita Electric had just not gotten what it took to make movies & TV shows.\n\nAnd Edgar? Right from the get-go, he wanted to show that Seagrams was NOT going to be Matsushita Electric Redux. Bronfman was looking for a way to send a clear message to Hollywood\u2019s creative community that Universal\u2019s new owners got it. That they were willing to work with Hollywood to make the best possible movies & TV shows at Universal.\n\nAnd how did Edgar decide to get this message across? By making a funny movie.\n\nZucker Commissions Trey Parker for \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d\n\nMind you, Bronfman himself didn\u2019t make this film. The owner of Seagrams reached out to David Zucker. Who \u2013 after initially agreeing to produce this introduction-to-Universal film \u2013 then farmed out the production of the actual project to Trey Parker. Who \u2013 just two days before shooting was supposed to star on the Universal Lot \u2013 persuaded Matt Stone to come help him on this project.\n\nWhich brings us to \u201cYour Studio and You.\u201d Which is a parody of an educational film from the 1950s, right down to being shot in black & white and featuring a very generic soundtrack.\n\nNow what\u2019s amazing about watching \u201cYour Studio and You\u201d today is that this 14-minute-long film features some of the biggest names working in Hollywood back in the mid-1990s. We\u2019re talking about people like recent Golden Globe winner Demi Moore, Sylvester Stallone, Michael J. Fox and Angela Lansbury. Not to mention two of the most powerful men in all of Hollywood, Steven Spielberg & Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nAnd what\u2019s especially interesting about watch \u201cYour Studio and You\u201d is that \u2013 as you watch these performers go through their paces in this motion pictures (which \u2013 most of the time \u2013 involves doing some innocuous task while holding a Seagram\u2019s wine cooler) \u2013 you often get the feeling that this star is not in on the gag.\n\nSo how did Matt & Trey get away with this? Simple. There was never actually a script for \u201cYour Studio and You.\u201d\n\nFilming \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d at Universal Studios Hollywood\n\nMind you, David Zucker would always insist that there was. Especially when he\u2019d phone up celebrities on the Universal Lot and say \u201cHey, I\u2019m sending over a couple of college kids later today. They\u2019re working with me on a new parody film. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing for the new owners of Universal. I need just a half hour of your time. We\u2019re shooting something special for the party we\u2019ll be holding when the Seagrams people first arrive at the Studio. Absolutely. You\u2019ll definitely get an invite to that party. So can I count on you to help these kids out? Beautiful. They\u2019ll be over there later this morning.\u201d\n\nAnd then Matt & Trey would show up and say \u201c\u2026 Dang, Miss Lansbury. We\u2019re sorry. We must have left our copy of the \u2018Your Studio and You\u2019 script back in our office. Which is clear on the other side of the Lot. So \u2013 rather than waste your time \u2013 why don\u2019t we do this instead? Follow us over to the Psycho House. Where we\u2019re then going to get footage of you painting the front porch on Mother Bates\u2019 house while you say \u2018Gosh, with all of the wonderful improvements going on around here, everyone is going to want to work at Universal.\u2019 Oh, and can we also get you to wear this button on the front of your blazer which reads \u2018Universal is A-OK\u2019 ? \u201c\n\nAnd over & over again, the biggest names who were working for Universal at that time took part in the production of \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d because A) David Zucker vouched for Matt Stone & Trey Parker and B) this was something that was being made for the new owners of Universal. And it\u2019s just natural to want to get in good with the new boss.\n\nSteven Spielberg, Jeffery Katzenberg, and Jaws\n\nBut no one at Universal anticipated that \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d would wind up being as sharp edged as the finished product turned out to be. I mean, it\u2019s one thing to bite the hand that feeds you. But \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d ? It doesn\u2019t just bite the hand. It takes the hand off at the wrist.\n\nIt\u2019s a brutally funny film. With one of the meanest moments reserved for Steven Spielberg, who plays a driver on the Universal Studio Tour who\u2019s trying to persuade a tram full of bored tourists (one of whom is played by Jeffery Katzenberg) that the \u201cShark Attack\u201d scene down by Jaws Lagoon is actually exciting.\n\nSpielberg actually says lines like \u201c \u2026 Whoa, whoa. What is going on here? Ladies and gentlemen, this never happens. Look out! It\u2019s a shark! Whoa, that is one big scary shark.\u201d\n\n\n\nMind you, as footage of this mechanical shark repeatedly coming up out of the water is shown, \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d \u2018s off-screen narrator (who is voiced by Trey Parker says):\n\n\u201cBut what about tomorrow? If we don\u2019t keep in step with the times, things that were once neat and thrilling can become old and stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Studio & You\u201d Reception\n\nThis film was supposed to be shown only once at the welcoming party for Seagrams executive on the Universal Lot. And I\u2019m told that \u2013 when Edgar Bronfman saw the finished product at that party \u2013 he reportedly turned to David Zucker and said \u201c \u2026 That\u2019s a little more mean-spirited that I think it needed to be.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d was supposed to go back into the Universal vault, never to be seen again. But when \u201cSouth Park\u201d debuted on Comedy Central in August of 1997 and then became a sensation for its biting humor, there was suddenly a lot of interest in what else Matt & Trey had done. Which is why copies of \u201cThe Spirit of Christmas\u201d began to circulate. And \u2013 over time \u2013 copies of \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d began to bubble up.\n\nWhich \u2013 as Stone & Parker have repeatedly pointed out \u2013 was just not supposed to happen. Largely because none of the celebrities who appeared in \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d had never signed releases for Universal\u2019s legal department. Because \u2013 again \u2013 this was for a movie that was only going to be shown once at a private function on the Universal Lot.\n\nMatt mentioned (as part of a career retrospective at the Paley Center in LA back in 2000) that \u201c \u2026 they wouldn\u2019t even let us keep a copy of the finished film.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a funny but brutal movie. And worth taking a look at today especially if you\u2019re a theme park history buff because it shows Universal Studios Hollywood\u2019s \u201cJurassic Park: The Ride\u201d still under construction on the Lower Lot. That attraction would finally open to the public in June of 1996.\n\n\u201cYour Studio & You\u201d became a lot easier to see after Seagrams sold off its share of Universal to Vivendi in 2000. Copies began propagating online after that. Though Universal Legal will periodically make an effort to get the latest copy of \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d taken off the Internet because \u2013 again \u2013 none of the performers who appear on camera ever signed the proper releases and/or were paid for their efforts.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re up for a mean-spirited laugh, \u201cYour Studio & You\u201d is well worth 14 minutes of your time. That said, once you watch this thing, be warned:",

From time-to-time, Disney will reopen it as a lounge, and it is currently being used as the Florida Blue Lounge for the EPCOT Food and Wine Festival.\n\nYou can grab some snacks and sit in the air conditioning here while it\u2019s available as a lounge. However, we\u2019re still waiting for the full dining experience to return to this restaurant.\n\nHollywood Studios\n\nLightning McQueen\u2019s Racing Academy\n\nLightning McQueen\u2019s Racing Academy has been inside the Sunset Showcase building for years, but sadly it has now permanently closed.\n\nDisney announced that a new villains show will be replacing the Cars-themed attraction in the summer of 2025. We recently learned the official name of this new show, and we are looking forward to some Disney Villains in Hollywood Studios!\n\nThe Voyage of the Little Mermaid as we know it will NOT return to Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios. It\u2019s closed now, and Disney has confirmed that this show has permanently closed to make way for an updated version.\n\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid \u2013 A Musical Adventure\u201d, an all-new stage show, will replace the show in the Animation Courtyard theater, however its opening has been pushed to Summer 2025.\n\nAnimal Kingdom\n\nKali River Rapids\n\nThe water ride at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom also closed for its annual refurbishment on January 6th.\n\nWhen it\u2019s too cold out for water rides, Disney closes this one for yearly maintenance. We\u2019re not sure when it\u2019s expected to reopen, but we\u2019ll be keeping our eyes out for updates!\n\nTyphoon Lagoon\n\nTyphoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach swap being open throughout the year.\n\nAnd now the two water parks have officially swapped! Blizzard Beach is now open, and Typhoon Lagoon has closed for refurbishment.\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to enjoy a water park throughout the winter, you\u2019ll need to head to Blizzard Beach. We expect Typhoon Lagoon will reopen once again sometime in the spring! For now, enjoy the slopes!\n\nDisney World Hotels\n\nTopolino\u2019s Terrace \u2014 Disney\u2019s Riviera Resort\n\nTopolino\u2019s Terrace is a signature dining location on the rooftop of Disney\u2019s Riviera Resort. It offers a character breakfast and dinner.\n\nThis popular restaurant will be closed from January 12th through January 25th for refurbishment. If you\u2019re hoping to dine here, you\u2019ll have to wait about two weeks for it to reopen! In the meantime, there are several other character dining experiences around Disney World to try.\n\nEverything Pop Food Court \u2014 Pop Century Resort\n\nEverything Pop Food Court is a surprisingly great place to grab a bite of food if you\u2019re staying at Disney\u2019s Pop Century Resort.\n\nThis food court has been under construction since July 29th, and it was supposed to reopen to its full capacity on September 29th! Then the refurbishment was extended until November 30th. But now, it has been extended once again until April 2025!\n\nStormalong Bay \u2014 Disney\u2019s Yacht and Beach Club Resorts\n\nStormalong Bay is closed from January through June, 2025 for refurbishment.\n\nThe pool, lazy river, and pirate ship slide are all closed to guests.

By exploring various messages embedded in Disney\u2019s theme parks and animated features, from the Magic Skyway created for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair to the 1948 animated film Fantasia, we see Disney\u2019s recurring contemplation of evolution. Fantasia, in particular, provides an extended depiction of evolutionary history along with imaginatively rendered reflections on rationalism, materialism, and animism.\n\nAt first blush Fantasia\u2019s \u201cRite of Spring\u201d seems to promote Darwinian materialism, but as West explains, a closer look reveals considerable nuance and ambiguity. On the Magic Skyway, animatronics were used to tell stories of ages past, from the age of the dinosaurs to the arrival of man. Disney\u2019s presentation there skirted the origins of humans but, as West argues, the narration suggests that humanity is something qualitatively different, a message at odds with Darwinian materialism.

            "content": "2025 is a big year for Disneyland Resort. It\u2019s the 70th anniversary of Disneyland Park, and while there isn\u2019t a major E-ticket attraction opening this year, Disneyland's 70th anniversary is offering some incredible entertainment, as well as what might be one of the most groundbreaking creations in the history of Walt Disney Imagineering: an audio-animatronic of the man himself, Walt Disney.\n\nWalt Disney: A Magical Life, a new attraction at Disneyland, is set to open at the park's Opera House on May 16, 2025, the first day of Disneyland Resort\u2019s 70th anniversary. The show will, at least for now, replace Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, a show starring an audio-animatronic of the 16th President overseen by Walt himself. Not everybody is in love with this new idea, but I think it\u2019s the right choice for a reason that I'm sure Walt himself would understand.\n\n(Image credit: The Walt Disney Company)\n\nDisneyland Is Getting A Walt Disney Animatronic, And Not Everybody Is Happy About It\n\nThe announcement of Walt Disney: A Magical Life was made at D23 in August 2024. I was sitting two seats away from Roy P. Disney, the great-grandnephew of Walt, who was on hand when the show was revealed. The show will feature an audio-animatronic of Walt Disney speaking to an audience. For fans of Walt, this potentially sounds like an incredible experience.\n\nHowever, not every member of the Disney family is quite so happy to celebrate the development. Joanna Miller, Walt\u2019s own granddaughter, said the decision to create an animatronic of Walt showed a \u201clack of respect\u201d for the man who made Disneyland.\n\nShe\u2019s not the only one who feels that way. A lot of fans think that making Walt Disney an attraction inside his own theme park is a step too far. Some feel that it is disrespectful, and more than a little bit creepy, to create a robotic version of a real man who means so much to so many. Maybe making Walt an attraction in his own theme park is in bad taste.\n\nThis argument is at least understandable. However, after visiting The Walt Disney Family Museum (whose board, made up of many Disney family members, supports the attraction) earlier this month, I have come to the opposite conclusion, just as Walt himself once did.\n\n(Image credit: Disney+)\n\nWalt Created Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln As A Way To Connect Guests With The Real Man\n\nWhen Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln debuted at the 1964-65 World\u2019s Fair, it was a revelation. A full-size human audio-animatronic. Lincoln could stand up from a sitting position and speak. It was so real to the assembled audience that many reportedly believed it was simply an actor in costume. But it was a completely mechanical man, only voiced and programmed by real people.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWalt Disney had a particular love for Abraham Lincoln, and it was important to him that other people understand Lincoln in the way that he did. Over the holiday, I made my first (but not my last) trip to the The Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, one of the best places to celebrate the life of Walt Disney, and when walking through the section about the New York World\u2019s Fair, I noticed a quote from Walt which read\u2026\n\nWe didn\u2019t present the Gettysburg Address here in any form for the simple reason, I mean, everybody hears it everywhere. And I think a lot of people think that\u2019s the only thing that Lincoln ever said, and I think a lot of people even think that it was written by a fellow by the name of Gettysburg.\n\nWhen I read those words, I began to look very differently at the idea of a Walt Disney audio-animatronic. Walt saw his technology not as something that disrespected Lincoln, whom he adored, but as something that could bring greater respect and understanding to a man who deserved it.\n\nWalt\u2019s suggestion, that maybe people didn\u2019t have the proper context for Lincoln and didn\u2019t really understand him, or understand that he was even real, could also be said of Walt Disney himself. To many people, he\u2019s just a name, a stylized signature used as a brand.\n\nAt the very beginning of the Walt Disney Family Museum, there\u2019s a Peanuts cartoon from 1963, three years before Walt passed away, that sees Sally watching TV before asking Charlie Brown \u201cDo you think there really is a person named Walt Disney?\u201d\n\nMost of what any of us have seen of the man comes from the old TV show he once hosted. If somebody said that Walt Disney was a character played by an actor on TV, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for somebody without all the information to believe that.\n\n(Image credit: TWDC)\n\nWalt Disney Is An Important Historical Figure, Just Like Abraham Lincoln\n\nAbraham Lincoln had been dead for nearly 100 years when his audio-animatronic version debuted at the World\u2019s Fair. Walt Disney will have been dead for less than 70 years when Walt Disney: A Magical Life debuts at Disneyland in May. Still, most of the people who knew Walt Disney well are also gone. Two major names, former Disney Parks chairman Dick Nunis and songwriter Richard Sherman, have both passed away in just the last few months. Soon all the people who could teach us about Walt Disney will be gone, just as he is.\n\nWalt Disney: A Magical Life has the potential, if done right, to preserve the legacy of Walt Disney in a way that few other methods possibly could. It would make it \u201creal\u201d in a way that only audio-animatronics can.\n\nAnd if the technology is acceptable for Abraham Lincoln, surely it\u2019s worthy of Walt Disney. Walt didn\u2019t win a war, but he changed the world nonetheless. These are two great men; two of the greatest to ever exist in their particular fields. If immortalizing one in this way is ok, it has to be ok for the other.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like Walt Disney Imagineering doesn\u2019t understand the tightrope they\u2019re walking. There\u2019s another quote at the Walt Disney Family Museum, right next to the one from Walt mentioned earlier. It\u2019s from Imagineer Harriet Burns, and it specifically mentions the complex issues that come with this sort of an attraction, because they were the same considerations that were made when Disney made Lincoln. Burns said\u2026\n\nI thought, this was going to get us in trouble. Because he was a historical character and people know what Lincoln was like, and we\u2019re going to get in deep stuff if we don\u2019t get it right.\n\nDisneyland has to get it right, that goes without saying. But the Imagineers got it right with Lincoln, and so I have to believe doing it again with Walt is possible.\n\nDisney has made a few statements about just what we\u2019ll get and what we won\u2019t when Walt Disney: A Magical Life debuts in May. Most importantly, the company has said that the voice of Walt will not use AI to create statements he never made. Whatever Walt says will come from the man\u2019s actual statements throughout his life. This is vital.\n\nSecondly, we\u2019ve been told that the Walt animatronic will be a state-of-the-art creation, using technology we haven\u2019t seen before. While this has the potential to drop animatronic Walt right in the middle of the uncanny valley, it\u2019s the least that can be done to try and make the experience as real as possible.\n\nIt's been suggested that Walt Disney himself would never have wanted to be an attraction in his own park. His alleged statements to that effect are questionable at best, but I can certainly imagine he would have felt that way. Walt never saw himself on par with his idols like Lincoln, Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. His attempt to build Epcot was in part an attempt to do something to truly make the world a better place, as he believed they did.\n\nI would argue Walt Disney had already done as much to change the world as his heroes. Like Lincoln, Walt is just as much a legend as a man. Perhaps this new attraction can use the legend, to help us all know the man just a little bit better.\n\nI can\u2019t promise that Walt Disney: A Magical Life will be perfect or even good. I do, however, believe that the show can be great and that it\u2019s a perfectly acceptable way to honor Walt Disney.",

Of course I do. George Michael has instilled that in me from a very early age.\n\nHowever, maybe what Disney needs is a healthy boost of originality to revitalize the studio that hasn't been as strong as they\u2019d like it to be in recent years.\n\nLooking at this year\u2019s crop of Best Animated Feature nominees, originality is at the forefront.\n\nFlow is the big standout, a Latvian triumph.\n\n(Respectfully, name another \u201cLatvian triumph\".)\n\nThe silence of the film\u2019s characters breeds real suspense and yearning for the story\u2019s completion.\n\n(and, like, name a better capybara in film.)\n\nFlow is grittier than most, with an animation style all its own that reads as a comic book mixed with water colors. It\u2019s a remarkable feat for a country that cites itself as having a lack of resources for animation and the film industry.\n\nMaybe Disney could look towards this as a sign to play outside the box they\u2019ve confined themselves into? Maybe a less than 90 minute, silent film? Maybe something a bit smaller in scope, but bigger in heart than their other recent works?\n\nIf you watch Flow and don\u2019t want to snuggle that labrador retriever, you don\u2019t have a heart. However, I audibly stated \u201cI\u2019m about to punch Maui in the face\" during Moana 2. So maybe there\u2019s a lesson to be had?\n\nToday, I just finished watching the sensational Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.\n\nThat is how you do comedy, folks. Quaint, well-written, superbly calibrated comedy.\n\nA villainous penguin in a nun disguise? Put it in the Louvre, \u2018cause that\u2019s art.\n\nSometimes, especially in recent memory, Disney films go for either an obvious joke or one that is bottom of the barrel. A burp, a fart, a smidge of potty humor, or something so benign, no laughter forms from it.\n\nVengeance Most Fowl earnestly shares the smartest humor imaginable, whether or not the \u201ckey demo\" will find it funny. For that, it succeeds. It harkens back to Hercules, a movie that is funny for all, not just the youngest of viewers because \u201cpoop\".\n\nArguably my favorite animated film of the year is The Wild Robot. Dreamworks, most known for their love of the above \u201cpoop\" took a creative risk for themselves, utilizing stunning worldbuilding and immaculate storytelling to create a masterpiece.\n\nWhat does it have that Disney has strayed far away from? A storybook.\n\nThe Wild Robot is based on a series of books and has become a great jumping off point for a (soon-to-be) franchise with depth and wonder.\n\nWhen was the last time Disney looked at an actual story? Frozen? We were promised Gigantic, a retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk, but it was rudely pulled from our hands like the Main Street Theatre at the Magic Kingdom.\n\n(Yes, I\u2019m still bitter.)\n\nAre there fairy tales untapped by Disney? Are there modern children\u2019s books that are ripe for storytelling?\n\nSometime seems amiss with Walt Disney Animation Studios and, while I still am looking forward to the upcoming sequels, I\u2019m worried we are straying from good storytelling and lasting films.\n\nMaybe the key to future success is to look towards the upcoming Academy Award nominees. \u2018Cause I can guarantee ya, Moana 2 won\u2019t be alongside them.",

Chambers will report in to Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro. Current EMEA President Jan Koeppen is stepping down in February as part of the restructure.\n\nIn the new structure, several of the company\u2019s lines of business in the region, including Direct-to-Consumer, Ad Sales, Platform Distribution, Networks, Local Original Content, Studio Marketing, Theatrical Distribution and Sports will now report directly in to the global business leaders of those businesses, who will have P&L oversight for their respective regional businesses in EMEA. The regional president will continue to be the company\u2019s representative in the region and be responsible for consolidating strategic priorities and financials and coordinating teams at the regional level, leading local initiatives that span across businesses (excluding Disney Experiences), and overseeing shared service functions including human resources, communications, and finance.\n\n\u201cEMEA is a key region in terms of the success of our business globally, and as we realign our strategy for our entertainment businesses there, we are fortunate to transition between two fantastic leaders,\u201d said Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, Co-Chairmen, Disney Entertainment, and Jimmy Pitaro, Chairman, ESPN. \u201cTony Chambers is a seasoned senior executive who has a highly collaborative style and stellar reputation in EMEA and across the company, and he brings a wealth of experience to this important new role. We look forward to continuing to accelerate our growth in EMEA and around the world, and we are immensely grateful for Jan\u2019s exceptional contributions, which have made a meaningful and enduring difference to this team and the company during his tenure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly honoured to be leading the world-class EMEA team in this new capacity,\u201d Chambers commented. \u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic region that has gone through incredible, positive change over the past several years and I\u2019m very eager now to build on that momentum.\u201d\n\nKoeppen noted: \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the incredible six years I have had at Disney, working with some of the most talented and creative people in the industry through a period of profound transformation and growth as we launched and established Disney+ in the region. I leave with a full heart and with great pride in the exceptional Disney EMEA team.\u201d\n\nWith Chambers taking on this new role, a new global head of Theatrical Distribution will be named in the near future.",

As noted a few weeks ago, this Festival will show off EPCOT\u2019s next use of CommuniCore Hall as a Festival Center when the space hosts \u201cOnce Upon A Stage: 30 Years of Disney on Broadway.\u201d Disney Parks Blog says guests will, \u201cexperience the magic of Broadway both on and off the stage in this walkthrough exhibit celebrating three decades of Disney on Broadway.\u201d The concept art shows costumes and props on display from Disney on Broadway stage musicals, and Disney Parks Blog says that guests will \u201cthen venture behind-the-scenes to see how the classic animated films \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cAladdin\u201d were reimagined for the Broadway stage.\u201d\n\nCommuniCore Hall will host \u201cOnce Upon A Stage: 30 Years of Disney on Broadway,\u201d during the 2025 edition of the EPCOT International Festival of the Arts. Concept Art courtesy of Disney.\n\nDuring the Festival, the food counter in CommuniCore Plaza will be the \u201cOpening Bites Food Studio,\u201d with a menu that Disney describes as, \u201cpaying homage to the foods and drinks immortalized onstage.\u201d The Disney Parks Blog Festival of the Arts Foodie Guide has been published containing all the menus for this year\u2019s Food Studios.\n\nThere will be another Figment-themed popcorn bucket available over at Odyssey during the Festival, while supplies last. Interestingly, Disney has not explicitly said that the buckets need to be purchased via mobile order as they had since the legendary six-hour queue formed for the first one a few years ago. Our astute readers know the they should be on the lookout for a mobile order requirement should Disney impose it again, but they should also be prepared for queues. The scarcity problem caused by the post-pandemic supply chain problems that faced that first Figment bucket, though, should not reoccur, but you never know.\n\nIn the Passholder Buzz section of the My Disney Experience app, Disney has teased that a new Annual Passholder magnet will soon be available. It seems to have a theme that ties to Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure based on the clues provided so far, and complimentary magnet distributions are often done during EPCOT festivals. It could mean that a Tiana\u2019s themed magnet will be distributed during the Festival at EPCOT, or maybe not. So, having said that, if you are a Passholder that wants to get the latest magnet, you will need to keep an eye out for the specific details of where the distribution will take place (and, of course, remember, that the complex park reservation rules remain in place for 2025: reservations required for all parks prior to 2 p.m. daily and Magic Kingdom on Saturday and Sunday, but park hopping all day subject to capacity after admission to one park). The Passholder teases usually only take a few days to be fully played out, so maybe we will have more details before the Festival starts\u2026",

Your gifts will help support requests from impacted teachers as they work to rebuild their school.\n\nWalt Disney Elementary opened in Alvin in 1979. The public school is named in honor of Disney's founder.\n\nDisney is the parent company of ABC13 Houston.\n\nPHOTOS: ABC13 and Disney surprise Walt Disney Elementary students",

            "content": "Walt Disney (DIS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned -2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has lost 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nDisney is expected to post earnings of $1.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.13 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Disney.",

With Chambers taking on this new role, a new global head of Theatrical Distribution will be named in the near future. Chambers will report to Disney Entertainment co-chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro. Current EMEA President Jan Koeppen is stepping down in February as part of the restructure.\n\nIn the new structure, several of the company\u2019s lines of business in the region, including direct-to-consumer, ad sales, platform distribution, networks, studio marketing, theatrical distribution and sports will now report directly to the global business leaders of those businesses, who will have P&L oversight for their respective regional businesses in EMEA. The regional president will continue to be the company\u2019s representative in the region and be responsible for consolidating strategic priorities and financials and coordinating teams at the regional level, leading local initiatives that span across businesses (excluding Disney Experiences), and overseeing shared service functions including human resources, communications, and finance.\n\n\u201cEMEA is a key region in terms of the success of our business globally, and as we realign our strategy for our entertainment businesses there, we are fortunate to transition between two fantastic leaders,\u201d said Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, co-chairmen of Disney Entertainment, and Jimmy Pitaro, chairman of ESPN. \u201cTony Chambers is a seasoned senior executive who has a highly collaborative style and stellar reputation in EMEA and across the company, and he brings a wealth of experience to this important new role. We look forward to continuing to accelerate our growth in EMEA and around the world, and we are immensely grateful for Jan\u2019s exceptional contributions, which have made a meaningful and enduring difference to this team and the company during his tenure.\u201d\n\n\n\nChambers commented, \u201cI\u2019m truly honored to be leading the world-class EMEA team in this new capacity. It\u2019s a dynamic region that has gone through incredible, positive change over the past several years and I\u2019m very eager now to build on that momentum.\n\n\n\nJan Koeppen added, \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the incredible six years I have had at Disney, working with some of the most talented and creative people in the industry through a period of profound transformation and growth as we launched and established Disney+ in the region. I leave with a full heart and with great pride in the exceptional Disney EMEA team.\u201d",

The WME office is closed.\n\nThe accommodations from employers underscore one way that Hollywood has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced offices and studio lots to shut down and employees to work remotely.

If you're looking for certain superhero or space opera movies, you're going to have to go elsewhere (and by elsewhere, we mean our upcoming Marvel and upcoming Star Wars lists).\n\nSteamboat Willie may be in the public domain, but his former masters are in no danger of losing the animation wars anytime soon. To keep up with everything that Disney is putting out in the cartoon department (departoon? We'll workshop it), Popverse has put together this list of every upcoming Disney animated film , and we've posted it below for you to check out.\n\nDisney Animation might look very different from what '90s and '00s kids grew up with, both in style and, maybe even more interestingly, in output. However, Disney's still plugging away on creating new stories using the animation medium, both as standalone projects and as sequels to recent IP the studio has found success in. Looking ahead, here are all the upcoming animated Disney movies with confirmed release dates:\n\nBut getting a release date isn't where a movie begins its journey, and for for a couple upcoming animated Disney projects, the relase date stage has yet to be reached. Fortunately, though, we know what at least a few of those movies are; listed here for your information and edification:\n\nAnd finally, there are a crop of movies that not only lack a release date, but technically still haven't been officially greenlit by the House of Mouse. Yes, the films you see below are in the developmental stage of filmic gestation (try coming up with a grosser term, I dare you), but that doesn't mean they're not worth including on this list. In no particular order, here they are:\n\nTitle Release Date Frozen IV Not yet greenlit The untitled Family Guy movie Not yet greenlit Rio 3 Not yet greenlit\n\nAnd with that, our upcoming Disney Animation list is complete. We'll be coming back to it every time a new movie is announced, so keep an eye right here for updates.\n\nBut before we leave you, here are a few of the biggest FAQs the internet seems to have about Disney's upcoming animated projects, along with out best attempts at answering them.\n\nFAQ 1: What is the next Disney Animated movie to come out?\n\nAs you can see in the list above, Disney is teaming up with Pixar for its next animated special, a science fiction comedy called Elio. It's about the titular Elio, whose curiosity about life in outer space leads him to becoming a galactic ambassador for Earth. The film was announced all the way back at the 2022 D23 Expo, and will see Jameela Jamil, Brad Garrett, and Zoe Salda\u00f1a in the vocal cast.\n\nYes, Disney seems to be aware of the \"cast Zoe Salda\u00f1a in a scifi\" rule for Hollywood success, though she won't be playing an alien this go-round. Of course, we didn't see the Star Trek movies suffering for casting her in a human role.\n\nFAQ 2: Will there be a Tangled 2?\n\nWell, it depends on what you mean by \"Tangled 2.\" Technically a sequel to Tangled already exists in the form of Tangled Ever After, a short film released in 2012 that saw Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi returning to their roles as Rapunzel and Flynn Rider, respectively. However, you're probably talking here about whether or not Tangled will get a big-screen sequel. And the answer to that, as of this writing, is no.\n\nAll the way back in 2015, Tangled producer Roy Conli told Den of Geek that directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard \"weren\u2019t really interested\" in doing a sequel to their Rapunzel adaptation, also mentioning that \"her hair was gone,\" admittedly a pretty good point. However, Deadline did announce in December of 2024 that Disney was working on a live-action adaptation of the movie...\n\nProbably without Zachary Levi's involvement.\n\nFAQ 3: Will there be a Moana 3?\n\nSimilarly, Moana will make her next big-screen appearance in live-action, as reported by Variety all the way back in 2023. However, even with a live-action adaptation on the way, Moana has a better chance of seeing an new animated chapter than does Tangled. Speaking with Screen Rant at the 2025 Golden Globes, Moana 2 co-director Dana Ledoux Miller had this to say:\n\n\"I think that the fact that so many people have come out to see this movie means that there's a lot of love for Moana. In a year and a half I have another film coming out, it's the live-action Moana, so there's a lot of Moana love to go around. And who knows what else is next.\"\n\nIs it a confirmation of Moana 3? Absolutely not. Is it a positive sign for Moana fans? Possibly.\n\nFAQ 4: What is the next new Pixar movie?\n\nAgain, the next Pixar movie is the aforementioned Elio, with Hoopers, Toy Story 5, and Incredibles 3 in line after that. Then, as you can see, there's an untitled Pixar film that's been set for release June 18, 2027. Unfortunately, there's next to nothing we can say about this mystery movie save for its date (which Variety reported in August 2024), however, we can speculate that this untited 2027 Pixar movie will not be a sequel.\n\nWhy? Because in May of 2024, Pixar president Jim Morris told Bloomberg that that the studio would release three movies every two years, with \"every other title a sequel or spinoff and the rest standalone concepts or potential seeds for new franchises.\" Though some might call that a grim omen for original storytelling (me, I'm some), it does give us a hint at what's next for the studio. With Toy Story 5 and Incredibles 3 filling those IP spots in Pixar's future, it would make sense that the untiled film is a standalone.\n\nWhich is good news, right?",

But here\u2019s what you should know first.\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Camping under the star at Disney World's Fort Wilderness: What to know At Disney's Fort Wilderness in Lake Buena Vista, FL, guests can enjoy the most affordable - and surprisingly magical - way to stay on property.\n\nDisney's Fort Wilderness Resort offers the cheapest overnight accommodations at Walt Disney World for visitors willing to camp.\n\nThe cost of staying at Fort Wilderness varies depending on campsite type, date, and whether guests bring their own camping equipment or rent an RV.\n\nFort Wilderness provides a range of amenities, including restrooms with showers, on-site dining, pools, playgrounds, and transportation to the theme parks.\n\nThe cheapest place to stay at Walt Disney World isn\u2019t a hotel.\n\nIt\u2019s a tent or pop-up trailer at Disney\u2019s Fort Wilderness, a sprawling resort with campsites and cabins near Magic Kingdom.\n\nWith fully equipped campsites, plenty of nearby restrooms, on-site dining, and loads of outdoor recreation, Fort Wilderness makes camping easy even for first-timers. Fellow campers who decorate their campsites and golf carts and \"pixie dust\" guests with treats add to the charm. But camping is not for everyone, and there are costs to consider beyond nightly rates, as my family discovered firsthand.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about camping at Disney World.\n\nHow much is Fort Wilderness per night?\n\nCampsite prices vary by date and type. The cheapest option is a tent or pop-up campsite. Larger RVs require different, more expensive sites. You can also pay for premium locations.\n\nOne way to find the cheapest rates is to look for dates with the lowest starting price for single-day theme park tickets, which you can find on Walt Disney World\u2019s website. This year, those dates include Aug. 25 through 28 and Sept. 9 through 11. On those dates, the nondiscounted price for a tent pop-up campsite is $73 per night. A \u201cStay Longer and Save More\u201d promotion available for most dates from May 1 through Sept. 30 brings the starting price down further to just over $62 per night with a one-night minimum stay.\n\nWe paid $113 for our tent site over the holidays, a popular time at the resort.\n\nInside the Disney bubble: Is staying on-site at Disney worth the cost?\n\nHow much does it cost to camp at Disney World?\n\nIt depends on how much gear you have. Fort Wilderness does not rent tents or campers, but RVs are available to rent from third parties. I bought a new tent, two new air mattresses, and a new sleeping bag, which totaled $114. Combine that with the $113 I paid for the campsite and that would have been more than enough for a hotel room with actual beds for the night.\n\nYou can save money on meals by cooking while camping. There\u2019s a charcoal grill at each campsite. I brought a few snacks, including s\u2019mores fixings, from home, but we decided to dine at Trail\u2019s End, an onsite restaurant, for our main meals. Whole pizzas start at $20.99 and family meals with a shareable entree and three sides start at $28.99.\n\nGolf cart rentals also cost extra but are not required. I paid $70 for a one-day rental. The resort also offers free internal buses.\n\nWhat\u2019s included in the Campsites at Fort Wilderness?\n\n\u201cEach campsite is equipped with privacy-enhancing landscaping, water, cable television and electrical hook-ups, a picnic table and a charcoal grill. Most campsites also include a sewer hook-up, and some even permit pets,\u201d according to Disney World\u2019s website. Pets are not permitted in tents or pop-up trailers.\n\nThere are clean public restrooms with private shower stalls, called comfort stations, within footsteps of every campsite. There\u2019s also free parking, free internal bus transportation, and free ferry and bus transportation to the parks and Disney Springs shopping, dining and entertainment complex.\n\nFree recreational offerings include pools, playgrounds, trails, Chip \u2018n\u2019 Dale\u2019s Campfire Singalong, movies under the stars, and visiting Disney\u2019s horse stables, Tri-Circle-D Ranch. Guests can also play checkers and trade pins at the Fort\u2019s two Trading Post shops. Horseback riding, wagon or carriage rides, fishing, bike rentals, archery, and the long-running Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue dinner show are available for a fee.\n\nGuests also get free early entry to all four Disney World theme parks and new this year, free entry to a Disney water park on their check-in date.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to camp at Disney World?\n\nOur experience was a mix of magic and misery, to no fault of Fort Wilderness.\n\nEvery cast member we encountered was lovely. Our family loved Chip \u2018n\u2019 Dale\u2019s Campfire Singalong. It\u2019s such a treat seeing characters outside of the parks and character dining venues. We enjoyed driving our rented golf cart around, admiring fellow guests\u2019 decorations and placing trinkets in holiday stockings they\u2019d put out for their kids. We also took part in an unofficial scavenger hunt initiated by fellow guests. There is a real sense of community at the Fort.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t sleep well. Our campsite was right next to a bus stop and comfort station. Even though fellow guests are generally respectful, it was noisier than we would have liked. It was also cold, with lows in the 40s. All the blankets I\u2019d packed couldn\u2019t compare to a climate-controlled hotel room. Worst of all, one of our air mattresses deflated early on, and my youngest and I wound up sleeping on the hard ground.\n\nWho shouldn\u2019t camp at Fort Wilderness?\n\nIf you don\u2019t like camping, you\u2019re probably not going to like camping at Fort Wilderness, even with all its conveniences and perks.\n\nIt would also be tough to tent camp if you aren\u2019t driving a car to Disney World, though theoretically, you could check your gear in on a plane.\n\nYou can still stay in Fort Wilderness, though, in a cabin or third-party rented RV. Our family has previously stayed in the cabins and would definitely do that again.\n\nCan you drive to Fort Wilderness without staying there?\n\nGenerally, you can\u2019t park at Disney World resort hotels unless you\u2019re staying there or have some sort of reservation, like dining or recreation. However, you can take free resort transportation to the Fort to enjoy its activities.\n\nAre they getting rid of the cabins at Fort Wilderness?\n\nYes and no. The older log cabins at Fort Wilderness are being replaced with modern cabins that are also Disney Vacation Club properties.\n\nThey are still open to the general public for stays.\n\n(This story was updated with additional information, a video and photos.)",

Chambers will report to Disney Entertainment co-chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro. The film studio has plans to appoint a new global head of theatrical distribution in the near future.\n\n\u201cEMEA is a key region in terms of the success of our business globally, and as we realign our strategy for our entertainment businesses there, we are fortunate to transition between two fantastic leaders,\u201d said Bergman, Walden and Pitaro said in a statement. \u201cTony Chambers is a seasoned senior executive who has a highly collaborative style and stellar reputation in EMEA and across the company, and he brings a wealth of experience to this important new role. We look forward to continuing to accelerate our growth in EMEA and around the world, and we are immensely grateful for Jan\u2019s exceptional contributions, which have made a meaningful and enduring difference to this team and the company during his tenure.\u201d\n\nThe Walt Disney Company operates in over 130 markets across Europe, Middle East and Africa. The company plans to commit $5 billion over the next five years to produce more blockbuster movies and TV shows in EMEA, including local originals for the Disney+ streaming service.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn the new structure, U.S.-based global leaders will have direct oversight of the regional businesses, leading those teams and setting the strategy in areas including direct-to-consumer, ad sales, platform distribution, networks, studio marketing, theatrical distribution and sports. Regional presidents will have P&L oversight for their respective businesses in EMEA and will continue to be the company\u2019s local representative. That includes consolidating strategic priorities and financials and coordinating teams at the regional level and spearheading initiatives across businesses (except for Disney Experiences). They will also oversee shared functions like human resources communications and finance, according to a company press release.\n\nChambers has been at Disney for 30 years, most recently overseeing global film distribution as well as home entertainment under the expansive Disney umbrella of Walt Disney Animation, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures since 2021. Prior to that, Chambers was senior VP of studio distribution and country manager in the United Kingdom and Ireland. He joined the company in 1995 and held various positions, including head of studio sales and distribution for the Middle East, Europe and Africa, as well as general manager of emerging markets, where he led operations in the Middle East, Israel, Africa, Turkey, Greece and Cyprus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly honored to be leading the world-class EMEA team in this new capacity,\u201d Chambers said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic region that has gone through incredible, positive change over the past several years and I\u2019m very eager now to build on that momentum.\u201d\n\nKoeppen, who was appointed as president of the Walt Disney Company EMEA in 2019, was responsible for overseeing Disney\u2019s portfolio in EMEA in regards to Disney+, motion pictures, television, content licensing, local original productions and stage plays as well as strategy and business development. Before joining Disney, Koeppen was president of Fox Networks Group in Europe and Africa and chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox in Europe and Asia.\n\nKoeppen noted: \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the incredible six years I have had at Disney, working with some of the most talented and creative people in the industry through a period of profound transformation and growth as we launched and established Disney+ in the region. I leave with a full heart and with great pride in the exceptional Disney EMEA team.\u201d",

Alvin ISD spokesperson Renae Rives said parents have already been notified of changed bus routes for the different campus.\n\n\u201cWe have worked very hard with our team to make sure that we minimize as much as possible, any kind of confusion for parents, anything like that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make this as smooth of a transition as possible.\u201d\n\nAccording to the district south of Houston, staff members worked to prepare the temporary facility so it can be used for teaching and learning.\n\n\u201cWe had teams of recovery disaster people that came in and our own teams from Alvin ISD and have revitalized that building and have gotten it ready for our students,\u201d Rives said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to welcome them back and make them feel as comfortable as possible in the new facility.\u201d\n\nRives said that for teachers, many of them lost school supplies they contributed to the classroom with their personal finances.\n\n\u201cRight after Christmas time, that\u2019s very difficult for a teacher to abruptly have to re-purchase all this stuff,\u201d she said.\n\nResidents who would like to help can reach out to the Alvin ISD Education Foundation online. Rives said many teachers also have their own lists posted online of supplies that are still needed. Members of the community came together earlier this week to collect some new supplies as well.",

            "content": "No matter how many times you've been to Walt Disney World, there is one magical place in the park you've likely never seen. Originally meant to be Walt Disney's apartment when he and his family visited, the Cinderella Castle Suite was never intended to be public. Sadly, Disney died before the suite was finished, so it was used for storage and as a workplace for the park's phone operators for years before it opened for a limited number of stays.\n\nToday, the only way to score a stay in Cinderella Castle is by winning the occasional sweepstakes or raffle for charity. Though celebrities like Tom Cruise and Mariah Carey have reportedly been invited in the past, rumor has it that Disney has declined bribes of up to $40,000 for a night's stay. The suite remains the best-kept secret at Walt Disney World, but we've compiled photos of the magical bedchamber below to sate your curiosity.\n\n\n\nA Peek Inside the Cinderella Suite\n\nCourtesy of Disney\n\nThe 650-square-foot apartment was inspired by a 17th-century French ch\u00e2teau, complete with coffered ceilings and stained glass windows. The snug suite is by no means sprawling, but what it lacks in space it makes up for in details. It consists of a foyer, a salon, a bedchamber, and a bathroom, each with its own opulent touches and unique details chosen by the Imagineering team, who finished it for its debut during the Year of a Million Dreams event in 2006. There\u2019s 24-karat-gold molding and stained glass depicting scenes from the Cinderella fairy tale.\n\nTo get there, guests must pass a grandfather clock with the minute and second hands forever frozen at 11:59 p.m. before hopping on an elevator to the fourth floor.\n\nThe elevator takes guests to a gorgeous foyer with a mosaic tile floor featuring Cinderella's pumpkin coach and her glass slipper on display. It's said that celebrities who stayed in the suite in the past were gifted their own glass slipper before they bid adieu.\n\nCourtesy of Disney\n\nIn the parlor, there's a Victorian-style rotary phone, a 17th-century Dutch desk, books \"borrowed from Belle,\" and six stained glass windows that face Fantasyland. If you're ever lucky enough to peer out of these windows, don't expect to see a great view of the park \u2014 they're more decorative than anything else.\n\nThe bathroom has a luxurious spa tub for relaxing, complete with ambient mood lighting that can go from soft white to soothing green. Those who stay here can sit back and admire the surrounding mosaic scenes from \"Cinderella,\" or switch off the lights and gaze upon the starry night ceiling.\n\nCourtesy of Disney\n\nThe bedchamber has two queen canopy beds (with Cinderella's royal crest on the headboards) and an antique fireplace. A portrait of Cinderella hanging above the fireplace doubles as a flat-screen TV.\n\nHow to Get the Cinderella Castle Experience\n\nUnfortunately, the suite cannot be booked or toured. Check the Disney Parks Blog, where sweepstakes offering a night's stay in the castle are often announced. Although your chances of winning are slim, there are other ways you can get a glimpse inside the castle. If you have children between the ages of three and 12, you can take them to Fantasyland's Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique for a fairy-tale makeover. Inside the ornate room, decorated with Cinderella-blue draperies, golden chandeliers, and frescoes, kids are treated by Fairy Godmother's apprentices to hairstyling, manicures, and costumes.\n\nBut for the ultimate experience inside the castle, reserve a table at Cinderella's Royal Table and dine with Disney Princesses. Take a spiral staircase or gilded elevator from the castle\u2019s grand hall to the banquet hall, where you\u2019ll dine under stone archways and stained glass windows. The restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with dishes ranging from caramel apple-stuffed french toast to beef tenderloin to coffee pots de creme. Just be sure to reserve your spot well in advance so you don't miss out on this incredible experience.",

            "content": "Disney World has had several rides, attractions, and restaurants on its refurbishment list already, but very soon, three more will be added!\n\nJanuary 6th is going to be a big day for three Disney World parks as three rides close for varying lengths of time. Routine maintenance and likely more (at least for one ride) is in store for these rides!\n\nBig Thunder Mountain Railroad\n\nThe \u201cWildest Ride in the Wilderness\u201d is officially closing for at least a year starting on January 6th!\n\nA \u201clittle bit of new magic\u201d is getting added to the popular Magic Kingdom ride. It will reopen once again sometime in 2026!\n\nGran Fiesta Tour\n\nThe three Caballeros are saying good bye for a multi-month long refurbishment on January 6th.\n\nThe ride in the Mexico pavilion at EPCOT is expected to reopen again on March 15th!\n\nKali River Rapids\n\nThe water ride at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom is also closing for its annual refurbishment on January 6th.\n\nWhen it\u2019s too cold out for water rides, Disney closes this one for yearly maintenance. We\u2019re not sure when it\u2019s expected to reopen, but we\u2019ll be keeping our eyes out for updates!\n\nThese three rides join the lineup of closures at Disney World all on January 6th! Let\u2019s take a look at everything else on the list of closures for the week of January 5th through January 12th.\n\nFrontierland Shootin\u2019 Arcade\n\nThe opening day attraction, the Frontierland Shootin\u2019 Arcade, officially closed on June 23rd.\n\nThis closure is to make room for a new DVC lounge that will soon be coming to Frontierland. This will be the third DVC lounge in Disney World, but we don\u2019t have an opening date, yet.\n\nTomorrowland Terrace\n\nTomorrowland Terrace is a restaurant in Magic Kingdom that was usually only open occasionally, generally during particularly busy seasons. However, it\u2019s been a LONG time since we\u2019ve seen this spot open at all.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s only used for Magic Kingdom fireworks dessert parties where you can grab all you can eat treats. You must reserve your spot at these parties in advance, and they can sell out. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no word on when the restaurant itself might serve food again.\n\nTest Track closed on June 17th for reimagining! Disney released more details and announced that the ride will reopen in the late summer of 2025!\n\nWe know that the ride will continue to be a partnership with General Motors, and that they will be taking some inspiration from the original ride World of Motion.\n\nRestaurant Marrakesh\n\nRestaurant Marrakesh in the Morocco pavilion of World Showcase is closed as the restaurant it used to be. From time-to-time, Disney will reopen it as a lounge, and it is currently being used as the Florida Blue Lounge for the EPCOT Food and Wine Festival.\n\nYou can grab some snacks and sit in the air conditioning here while it\u2019s available as a lounge. However, we\u2019re still waiting for the full dining experience to return to this restaurant.\n\nHollywood Studios\n\nLightning McQueen\u2019s Racing Academy\n\nLightning McQueen\u2019s Racing Academy has been inside the Sunset Showcase building for years, but sadly it has now permanently closed.\n\nDisney announced that a new villains show will be replacing the Cars-themed attraction in the summer of 2025. We recently learned the official name of this new show, and we are looking forward to some Disney Villains in Hollywood Studios!\n\nThe Voyage of the Little Mermaid as we know it will NOT return to Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios. It\u2019s closed now, and Disney has confirmed that this show has permanently closed to make way for an updated version.\n\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid \u2013 A Musical Adventure\u201d, an all-new stage show, will replace the show in the Animation Courtyard theater, however its opening has been pushed to Summer 2025.\n\nTyphoon Lagoon\n\nTyphoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach swap being open throughout the year.\n\nAnd now the two water parks have officially swapped! Blizzard Beach is now open, and Typhoon Lagoon has closed for refurbishment.\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to enjoy a water park throughout the winter, you\u2019ll need to head to Blizzard Beach. We expect Typhoon Lagoon will reopen once again sometime in the spring! For now, enjoy the slopes!\n\nDisney World Hotels\n\nEverything Pop Food Court \u2014 Pop Century Resort\n\nEverything Pop Food Court is a surprisingly great place to grab a bite of food if you\u2019re staying at Disney\u2019s Pop Century Resort.\n\nThis food court has been under construction since July 29th, and it was supposed to reopen to its full capacity on September 29th! Then the refurbishment was extended until November 30th. But now, it has been extended once again until April 2025!\n\nStormalong Bay \u2014 Disney\u2019s Yacht and Beach Club Resorts\n\nStormalong Bay is closed from January through June, 2025 for refurbishment.\n\nThe pool, lazy river, and pirate ship slide are all closed to guests. If you\u2019re staying at one of these two hotels, you can enjoy one of the three leisure pools instead! There are two leisure pools at the Beach Club and one at the Yacht Club.\n\nThose are all of the closures for Disney World this week!

            "content": "Are you ready to talk about Disney rides?\n\nI have a really intense passion for Disney food, theme park changes, and merchandise. I have some how managed to turn these passions into a career so I have some pretty strong opinions on all things theme parks and I feel like it\u2019s finally time to get real about my favorite ride in Disney World.\n\nWhen it comes to picking a favorite ride in Disney World, it feels impossible to me! There are so many amazing rides and attractions that are so different and unique.\n\nI have always loved Mad Tea Party in Magic Kingdom, Expedition Everest thrills me every time, and Frozen Ever After in EPCOT makes me want to sing my heart out. Truly how can I pick a favorite? The point of this post, unfortunately, is to do just that.\n\nSo if I\u2019m being brutally honest, my top two favorites are Space Mountain and Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. They\u2019re both truly iconic roller coasters in Disney World with thrills and fun. Cosmic Rewind is one of the newest coasters in Disney World and it even features one of my favorite songs, \u201cSeptember\u201d by Earth, Wind, & Fire\n\nNow the songs are incredible but Space Mountain holds a special place in my heart thanks to riding it over and over again with my family, giggling every single time. So if I had to choose? I would have to flip a coin.\n\nWell I flipped a coin and my favorite ride is officially Space Mountain so it\u2019s time to be honest about this famous Disney dark ride. Before I say anything, I do need to stress how much I love this ride. Who wouldn\u2019t love taking a high flying trip to space?\n\nWell, apparently a lot of people and what\u2019s crazier, I get it! Space Mountain is a little disorienting. In Magic Kingdom, Space Mountain is a bob sled style attraction that is in complete darkness. There are some projections on the ceiling but they\u2019re pretty faint so if you\u2019re thrown on by pitch black, this one might be a bit much for you.\n\nAnother issue with my favorite ride? It\u2019s honestly pretty tough on the body. I turned 25 this year and I know objectively, that isn\u2019t old. However when I\u2019m getting off Space Mountain I might as well be 125 years old. The rocket throws you around the dark with fun twists and dips but they\u2019re pretty rough.\n\nWhen I push myself up out of the rocket after the ride is over, I\u2019d take a bet and say every single bone in my body cracks like a glow stick. Seriously one time I had a Cast Member look at me in awe when she heard how many sounds I made getting out of the ride.\n\nSo if we\u2019re being honest, the ride is pretty tough on the body but you know what? It\u2019s still my favorite. The way it makes me laugh as I go through the twists and turns, shocked by the drops I know very well, makes me love this ride.\n\nSo this is me bring real about my favorite ride in Disney. Real with you guys about the problems with it, and real with myself about what my actual favorite ride is. If we\u2019re continuing with the honesty train, I do think Disneyland\u2019s version is better but that\u2019s a topic for another day.

But figuring out how to manage the great number of rides, reservations, resorts and dining options can be a challenge. Add to that the new Lighting Lane passes, after-hours holiday parties and extended hours for those in deluxe resorts, and the choices can be downright dizzying.\n\nOn a recent trip to all four parks in Walt Disney World \u2014 Magic Kingdom, Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios and EPCOT \u2014 my family was on a mission to experience as much as possible, without reducing enjoyment and ruining the vacation. In 48 hours, we were able to enjoy 35 attractions at the parks, have a character breakfast at Tusker House Restaurant in Animal Kingdom, chow down on some burgers at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant at Hollywood Studios and grab some quick bites in other places. Fireworks were enjoyed, a holiday parade was experienced, and the main mode of transportation were the free Disney shuttles that took us back and forth to our resort, Port Orleans Riverside, a moderately-priced accommodation.\n\nA few overall tips before getting into ranking these 35 attractions \u2026 First off, wake up early. The early worm definitely catches the worm at Walt Disney World. If staying on property (a Disney resort), you\u2019ll be able to gain access to the parks 30 minutes prior to those staying off property. Check the opening times, and plan to be at the park of your choice a half hour prior, if not earlier. For us, on day one, that meant being at Animal Kingdom by 7:30 a.m. On day two, that meant being at Hollywood Studios by 8:30 a.m.\n\nOnce you gain early entry, enjoy some \u201crope dropping,\u201d a term that essentially means you speed-walk to the top attraction on your list. There usually is minimal line in the first few minutes of a park\u2019s opening. For us, this meant Avatar Flight of Passage, a simulation ride at Animal Kingdom. We hoofed it over to Pandora \u2014 The World of Avatar, where the ride is located, and still were met with a long-ish wait, but it paled in comparison to later in the day.\n\nAt Hollywood Studios, we pod-raced our way to Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance. Again, there was a wait, but nothing like the primetime afternoon hours. All in all, rope dropping was a success.\n\nWe also purchased park-hopper passes, which allowed us to change parks halfway through the day. So, after Animal Kingdom on day one, we headed to EPCOT in the early afternoon and stayed until the park closed at 9:30 p.m. Day two began with Hollywood Studios, and then we took advantage of Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party at Magic Kingdom (a separately ticketed event). This allowed access to the rides, plus free cookies and unique character meets, from the early evening until 12:30 a.m.\n\nIt should be noted that we enjoyed Walt Disney World in the days following Thanksgiving, a busy time period, but nothing like the Christmas to New Year\u2019s break. Also, we were assisted by Lightning Lane passes, which are kind of like paid skip-the-line tickets. Getting used to these can take some time, and whether to even buy them or not is up to individual visitors, but our family found them to be helpful and saved us long lines on in-demand rides.\n\nAt Animal Kingdom, we were already planning on rope dropping Avatar Flight of Passage, so we used our Lightning Lane multi pass (three reservations that can be renewed once you experience your first ride) on Expedition Everest \u2014 Legend of the Forbidden Mountain, Dinosaur and Kilimanjaro Safaris. Then, after checking in for one of these, we took advantage of some EPCOT reservations for later in the day.\n\nOn day two, we were rope dropping Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, so no reservation was necessary. Instead, we LL\u2019d Mickey and Minnie\u2019s Runaway Railway, Toy Story Mania and The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. After that, we reserved Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, Muppet-Vision 3D and Star Tours \u2014 The Adventure Continues. Then, we booked Pirates of the Caribbean at Magic Kingdom (more reservations were not needed because we had access to the park during the Christmas party, when capacity is much reduced and wait times are not too bad).\n\nThe most in-demand rides also had single Lightning Lane passes, which essentially means you pay one price for one ride. We only did this for Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, and we did not regret the expense.\n\nIf there\u2019s a special nighttime event at any of the parks, definitely try to take advantage of those extra hours without the huge crowds. They can be pricey, so it\u2019s up to individual budgets, but our family found the Christmas party an excellent time to roam a crowded, but definitely manageable, Magic Kingdom.\n\nHere is a ranking of the top 35 attractions that we experienced. It should be noted that we didn\u2019t ride everything because there were waits and limited time. Also, there were some seasonal closures and ride refurbishments. Sorry to Test Track, Slinky Dog Dash, Frozen Ever After and Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular, among a few others. Still, 35 attractions \u2014 encompassing rides and shows \u2014 in less than 48 hours is quite awesome.\n\n#35 Mission: SPACE at EPCOT\n\nThis ride simulates an adventurous and nauseating trip to Mars. I did the Orange Mission, which is the more intense of the two options. You definitely feel those G-forces, and I found the claustrophobic interior a bit harrowing for a tall person. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime ride, meaning one ride and that should be good for life. Once entering EPCOT, turn left and head toward Mission: SPACE, which is located right next to the new Guardians of the Galaxy roller coaster.\n\nInsider Tip: Lines for this decades-old attraction are typically minimal. I walked on during the final hour of operations. For a less intense space experience, try the nearby Space 220 restaurant. My family said it was awesome.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#34 Journey of Water, Inspired by Moana at EPCOT\n\nThis walk-through attraction actually had the family laughing and enjoying themselves more than most rides at Walt Disney World, so definitely don\u2019t miss it. Essentially you walk through a series of interactive water fountains that allow visitors to control the flow of the liquid. It was great fun commanding the waterfalls and making music as if we were Mickey in Fantasia!\n\nInsider Tip: There is no wait typically for this experience, even with Moana 2 dominating the box office. It\u2019ll take all of 10 minutes. You may get a little wet.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#33 It\u2019s Tough to Be a Bug! at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nFans of A Bug\u2019s Life, the second-ever Pixar film, should head over to Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World to bid farewell to this cute theater show that uses animatronics and 4D effects to introduce the crowd to some lovable and no-so-lovable insects. I\u2019m going to miss this attraction, which can be found under the Tree of Life. Word on Main Street USA is that a new Zootopia attraction will kick the bugs out for good.\n\nInsider Tip: This attraction has been around for more than 25 years. Long waits are almost nonexistent, and it\u2019s a nice, cool respite from the warm Florida sun.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#32 \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d at Magic Kingdom\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more classic than \u201cit\u2019s a small world\u201d at Magic Kingdom. It\u2019s right up there with Mickey Mouse and Cinderella\u2019s Castle. The nostalgia factor is what wins over riders so many decades after it first premiered. There are so many childhood memories wrapped up in this infectious, albeit repetitive, water-based ride.\n\nInsider Tip: There\u2019s something about this nonstop song that lulls one to sleep, so if you\u2019re looking for a quick nap, you can find no better place (except maybe the Hall of Presidents).\n\n#31 The Seas With Nemo & Friends at EPCOT\n\nEPCOT is about education, which sounds boring, but the theme park still has a lot of fun when they teach visitors about communication, agriculture, space and the ocean. Take, for instance, The Seas attraction starring none other than Nemo, Dory and their friends. It\u2019s cute and a bit cheesy, but also creatively designed. Nothing like riding in a clamshell for a few minutes.\n\nInsider Tip: Some of these dark rides and water-based rides double as points of rest during an otherwise busy day. Take advantage of the opportunities when they present themselves.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#30 Tomorrowland Speedway at Magic Kingdom\n\nMagic Kingdom still has the classic Tomorrowland Speedway, which I enjoyed as a kid. This tamer version of Test Track allows drivers to get behind the wheel and head around a course like a race car. Speeds are slow, but the joy is real.\n\nInsider Tip: Let everyone in your party take their own vehicle. Kids can drive, too!\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#29 Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nThis is probably the first \u201chot take\u201d of this Top 35 list because most people would rank this intense inverted roller coaster much higher. I get it. It\u2019s arguably the most adult ride Walt Disney World has ever created, but as far as coasters go, it\u2019s showing its age. A recent ride banged my family\u2019s heads and knees to the point of discomfort. Still, it was fun listening to Aerosmith and barreling through the dark, but this WDW fan cannot wait for the pending Muppets overlay (with hopeful upgrades to the track).\n\nInsider Tip: Although my family didn\u2019t take advantage of it, this is one of those rare rides with a single rider lane.\n\n#28 Kali River Rapids at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nWhat makes this ride enjoyable are not the thrills, which are in short supply. What wins over fans is the theming. Take a look around the surroundings in the queue area, while boarding the circular tubes and throughout the ride. This theming will be of more interest than the ride itself, which has one decent plunge (which oddly doesn\u2019t come at the end of the ride).\n\nInsider Tip: Weather will dictate how long you wait. Colder days will see these river rapids with no wait at all. In fact, Disney is gearing up for a refurbishment closure in the winter months.\n\n#27 The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh at Magic Kingdom\n\nThis delightful dark ride takes visitors into the heart of Winnie the Pooh\u2019s world. The images are colorful and exuberant, almost to the point that you forget about the predecessor of this ride: the classic Mr. Toad\u2019s Wild Ride. As my brother-in-law taught me, look for a few clues of Mr. Toad still hanging around.\n\nInsider Tip: Winnie the Pooh can have long waits, but the queue area is as delightful as the ride itself. It\u2019s best to hit this one early or late in the day.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#26 Muppet-Vision 3D at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nSadly this 3D attraction will soon be coming to an end. Muppet-Vision 3D will be replaced by a Monsters, Inc. show, and no disrespect to Mike and Sully, but it\u2019ll be sad to say goodbye to Kermit and company. Luckily for us, the Muppets will only be moving to the other side of the park. That\u2019s right, they will be taking over Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster, kicking out Aerosmith (see above).\n\nInsider Tip: Even with the closing announcement, walking up to the Muppets is easy to do. One should be able to snag a seat for the next show.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#25 Spaceship Earth at EPCOT\n\nMany first-timers to Walt Disney World don\u2019t know that the iconic globe-like structure at EPCOT is actually a ride called Spaceship Earth. This dark ride takes visitors on a journey through humankind\u2019s legacy of communication and technology. Steve Jobs even makes an appearance.\n\nInsider Tip: This can either be the first or last ride of your EPCOT vacation because it\u2019s right at the front entrance (unless you enter in the back by the Skyliner).\n\n#24 Toy Story Mania! at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nThis shooting game is a must for competitive families. We had a blast with these blasters as we attempted to rack up as many points as possible. Disney keeps score of who wins in each vehicle and who has the highest score of all time and highest score for the entire day. This one definitely plays to your inner-gamer. Essentially it\u2019s a 4-D ride that requires you to wear glasses and use a shooting device to take out a bunch of targets, each of which has different point values. What great fun! BTW: I lost miserably.\n\nInsider Tip: Sharing memories with strangers is fine at Disney, and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll have to do if you\u2019re flying solo or in an odd-number group.\n\n#23 Space Mountain at Magic Kingdom\n\nWhat a thrilling classic ride at Magic Kingdom! This one would be much higher on the list if not for two things: the ride is quite bumpy, especially for tall people, and the coaster is a bit overshadowed by the new Tron ride next door. That said, this is a must for the memories. Don\u2019t put up your arms!\n\nInsider Tip: Try to ride Space Mountain during those ultra-rare times when they put on the lights. We experienced the coaster with a holiday overlay.\n\n#22 Na\u2019vi River Journey at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nNa\u2019vi River Journey may not be the best water-based ride at Walt Disney World, but it features perhaps the best animatronic. The Pandora shaman at the end of the journey is something to behold. Wow, one wonders how the imagineers pulled that one off.\n\nInsider Tip: The two main attractions of Pandora \u2014 The World of Avatar often have long wait times, but somehow during my most recent trip with my family, the advertised wait times were never as bad as promised. For this one, it was billed as 50 minutes, and I was through the queue in 30.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#21 Kilimanjaro Safaris at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nNow that the list is dwindling down, we are at the point of tough decisions. One of the best attractions at Animal Kingdom is the experience that is the heart of the nature-filled park. Some of the sights on the safari are wondrous, and the drivers typically get quite close to the herd animals that can graze right by the vehicle. Definitely a must-do.\n\nInsider Tip: Just like a zoo, try not to visit at the height of a hot day. The animals will likely be resting.\n\n#20 Dinosaur at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nHurry up because Dinosaur the ride will soon go extinct at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom. This adventurous and bumpy ride into prehistoric times is Dino-tastic, featuring a thrilling storyline, top-notch animatronics and a few surprises around every turn. Visitors have all of 2025 to say goodbye, and then the ride will apparently be jettisoned for a new Indiana Jones experience.\n\nInsider Tip: Ride multiple times so you can figure out where they take your picture.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#19 TRON Lightcycle / Run at Magic Kingdom\n\nThis new launch coaster at Magic Kingdom is perhaps the most popular ride at that park, and for good reason. Riders assume a motorcycle position that is utterly unique, and the visuals of bouncing around the TRON-verse are awesome to behold. The only reason the coaster isn\u2019t higher on this list is because the ride is relatively short, and the theming, which is what Disney is all about, is a bit sparse. That said, it\u2019s one of the best coasters on property.\n\nInsider Tip: Rope drop this one, otherwise you may end up waiting for more than an hour. Rope dropping means walking right to your favorite ride as soon as the park opens, as my sister taught me.\n\n#18 Soarin\u2019 Around the World at EPCOT\n\nThere are a couple rides at Walt Disney World that use the Soarin\u2019 technology. Essentially visitors glide in front of a massive IMAX-style screen, simulating flight through the air. It\u2019s quite thrilling, especially when Soarin\u2019 brings riders around the major sights of the world. This one is pure majestic beauty.\n\nInsider Tip: After enjoying Soarin\u2019, head over to the other ride in the same pavilion. There you can experience Living With the Land.\n\n#17 Jungle Cruise at Magic Kingdom\n\nThere are only a few rides left that Walt Disney himself had a personal hand in creating. Jungle Cruise is one of them. The attraction, which takes visitors on a boat tour through the jungles of the world, first opened in Disneyland and then Walt Disney World. The animatronics and storylines are still classic Disney, but the great fun of the ride can be found in the corny jokes told by the skipper.\n\nInsider Tip: This is a classic ride that usually commands a long wait time. Budget some extra minutes, for sure. Also, during the holidays Jungle Cruise becomes Jingle Cruise with a holiday overlay.\n\n#16 Seven Dwarfs Mine Train at Magic Kingdom\n\nThis is not the best coaster at Walt Disney World. There are more thrilling options and longer rides, but the theming of this attraction is what bumps it up a few spots. After whipping through the silver mine, there is a slowdown part that allows you to enjoy the story of Snow White with animatronics. Not many coasters tell a story like this one. Also, each individual car sways left and right by itself.\n\nInsider Tip: This ride often has a loooong wait, one of the longest at WDW. Consider purchasing the single ride Lightning Lane pass.\n\n#15 Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure at Magic Kingdom\n\nCount me a fan of the new Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure, which is a redesigned and reimagined ride after the necessary shuttering of Splash Mountain. The thrills of the log flume are still present, but now Tiana and her fellow characters are featured amongst the animatronics. What wins me over is how long the ride is and how full the narrative feels. There\u2019s even a scene (the best one) after the big drop.\n\nInsider Tip: At the present moment, one cannot walk up to Tiana\u2019s and expect to join the line. A virtual queue spot or Lightning Lane pass is needed. It\u2019s that popular. Also, bring a poncho.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#14 Star Tours \u2014 The Adventure Continues at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nI\u2019ve been riding Star Tours with my family for my entire life. This immersive escape into the world of Star Wars captures the imagination and makes visitors believe they are assisting C-3PO on an intergalactic mission. This simulation ride is not to be missed and should never be removed from the park \u2014 never.\n\nInsider Tip: On days when the park isn\u2019t busy, Star Tours can still be a walk-on ride. It\u2019s overshadowed a bit by the new offerings in Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge.\n\n#13 Peter Pan\u2019s Flight at Magic Kingdom\n\nI\u2019m a nostalgia hound, so it should be no surprise that this opening-day attraction makes it so high on the list. This is a magical dark ride where visitors view the action from above, which is quite unique. The artistry of the scenes is top-notch, and everything feels like a fairytale book come to life, as if Walt Disney himself were turning the pages.\n\nInsider Tip: Peter Pan\u2019s Flight is notorious for its long wait. If it\u2019s busy in the park, expect to kill an hour or more here. That makes this attraction a prime candidate for Lightning Lane (if you\u2019re lucky) or rope dropping (if you\u2019re early).\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#12 Festival of the Lion King at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nFestival of the Lion King may be the best live show at any Walt Disney World park. Running nearly 30 minutes, the acrobatic and visual spectacle packs in the highlights of The Lion King with all of the movie\u2019s beloved songs. Hakuna Matata, indeed!\n\nInsider Tip: Festival of the Lion King is right next to one of WDW\u2019s best character meals: Tusker House Restaurant.\n\n#11 Remy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure at EPCOT\n\nThis ride uses new trackless technology to send visitors around an adventurous journey with everyone\u2019s favorite rat, Remy. Pixar\u2019s Ratatouille is one of my favorite animated films of all time, so to step into this world was a total dream.\n\nInsider Tip: There are not too many rides in EPCOT, which means the popular ones are super-popular. This one traditionally has a long wait, so take advantage of the single rider line and bypass the madness.\n\n#10 Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Magic Kingdom\n\nThere\u2019s no denying the thrill factor of this iconic Disney roller coaster. The cars are whipped around a sidewinding track that is themed like a desert canyon in Arizona. The ride has a solid length and seems to improbably double back on itself. It\u2019s actually dizzying because riders cannot quite see the full lay of the land from the queue area. This makes for an unexpected, fun journey. One of the best.\n\nInsider Tip: The ride is planned to go down for a refurbishment for 2025.\n\n#9 Mickey & Minnie\u2019s Runaway Railway at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nThis trackless dark ride is a controversial choice for this high on the list, especially because it replaced the beloved Great Movie Ride. But this one checks so many boxes: an adventure with the two main celebrities of Walt Disney World, smooth sailing on new tech cars, an infectious theme song and plenty of theming to go around. I\u2019m firmly in the MMRR camp. Plus, if you think about it, there\u2019s actually not much with Mickey and Minnie at WDW.\n\nInsider Tip: This is a popular ride, so it\u2019s a worthy candidate for rope dropping, especially since it\u2019s right at the front of the park.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#8 Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nA childhood dream came true when I walked through Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge for the first time. This Star Wars land at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios is so immersive and well-themed that it\u2019s hard to leave. There are a couple rides in Galaxy\u2019s Edge, including Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, which allows visitors the chance the pilot the famous Han Solo ship. This feels like an improved version of Star Tours, but on a more intimate and intense level. Relive your dreams!\n\nInsider Tip: Groups of six are favored on this simulation ride, otherwise there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be paired with strangers. My family ride was much better than when I (han) soloed with another family.\n\n#7 Pirates of the Caribbean at Magic Kingdom\n\nThere\u2019s good, and then there\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean good. This classic dark ride utilizes its water setting to tell a comprehensive narrative about a bunch of pirates wreaking havoc and imbibing plenty of alcohol. The ride has been updated to include Jack Sparrow and become more suitable for a 2025 audience. The storytelling and animatronics are pure fun; it\u2019s easy to get lost in this world of banditry.\n\nInsider Tip: Apparently in 2025 there\u2019s a new Pirates-themed bar coming to Magic Kingdom. Also, this ride does have a drop, but most visitors will find it fun and not too scary.\n\n#6 Expedition Everest \u2014 Legend of the Forbidden Mountain at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nIf ride technology had not progressed as much as it has, this one would be right near the top. It only falls behind because rides developed today have upped the ante. Expedition Everest is a fun, fun ride that tells a complete story of a runaway train being sabotaged by a Yeti on a forbidden mountain. The roller coaster starts out slow and leisurely, with panoramic views of snowy slopes and Tibetan prayer flags blowing in the wind. Then the abominable snowman attacks, causing a break in the tracks and sending riders backward through the mountain of their nightmares. This is when the coaster whips around and tries to escape the big man, culminating in a close encounter of the cryptid kind. This one is a beauty and wondrous to behold for lovers of mythical (real) creatures. Also, isn\u2019t it refreshing to have a non-IP ride at Walt Disney World.\n\nInsider Tip: For little or no wait, take advantage of the single rider lane. That said, this shortcut skips the intricate theming in the queue area. Try to do both if time allows. Also, sadly, as of this posting the Yeti remains immovable in the coaster\u2019s final scene, which means that the imagineers are still flashing strobes to mimic movement.\n\n#5 Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at EPCOT\n\nAnd the award for best roller coaster at Walt Disney World goes to Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. There\u2019s nothing like this wild trip to the stars set to a danceable soundtrack of tunes. The song we enjoyed was \u201cConga\u201d by Gloria Estefan, which had us dancing in our seats. It\u2019s difficult to describe the movement of this cutting-edge coaster. You move forward, backward and spin, all in the dark while bopping around a star system. It\u2019s like Space Mountain without the headache. Simply the best.\n\nInsider Tip: Demand for GotG is outrageous. There\u2019s no standby line currently, which means visitors must attempt to reserve a spot via virtual queue at either 7 a.m. or 1 p.m. Virtual queue reservations are free and accomplished via the WDW app. You can also purchase a single pass Lightning Lane for a specific time window. Be forewarned: This ride tends to be temporarily unavailable. We were lined up and almost got on, until it was halted. We had to return hours later.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#4 Avatar Flight of Passage at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom\n\nWhat happens when you pump steroids into Soarin\u2019 Around the World? You get Avatar Flight of Passage, the best simulation ride at Walt Disney World. Pandora \u2014 The World of Avatar at Animal Kingdom is one of the best themed areas Disney has ever created, and the queue for FoP may be the best of any ride. There are waterfalls, science stations and even a Na\u2019vi in a tank. The \u201cflight\u201d itself, where visitors get to ride a Banshee, is stunning. You can feel the creature breathing as you sit atop its winged body. You then fly through Pandora on a death-defying, spectacular journey. When you barely escape a crashing wave \u2014 that just may be the highlight of this exquisite attraction.\n\nInsider Tip: You can buy single pass Lightning Lane for this in-demand ride, and it may be worth it.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#3 The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nThe Tower of Terror has become the instantly recognizable symbol of Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios, and for good reason. This landmark ride has a little bit of everything and is wholly original. It\u2019s an ode to Rod Serling\u2019s TV creation. It\u2019s a dark ride. It\u2019s a thrill ride with a drop. It\u2019s a haunted house. In one word, it\u2019s perfect. I hope they never change it like they did in Disneyland. Keep those Guardians of the Galaxy out, and always honor The Twilight Zone.\n\nInsider Tip: Tower of Terror is near Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster and can be accomplished one right after the other. It\u2019s best to start your day on this side of the park or end it here.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#2 Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios\n\nAlthough this one lands at #2 on my list, make no mistake about it, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance is probably the best ride in the world. Now it just needs to withstand the test of time to see if it takes the top spot. This is an experience like no other. The queue area, theming, pre-show and ride itself are a technical marvel. The entire journey takes nearly 30 minutes, and there are so many twists, turns and surprises along the way that I was never not smiling. Wow, wow, wow.\n\nInsider Tip: This is one ride that I don\u2019t recommend the single rider line. It didn\u2019t move that much faster, and you skip some of the pre-show. Engage with the full experience.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\n#1 The Haunted Mansion at Magic Kingdom\n\nI\u2019m not sure if anything will ever beat this classic ride. The views of the mansion, the pre-show in the room that stretches, the doom buggies, how the buggies move directions, the ghostly sights, the family-friendly scares, the infectious theme song, the tons of atmosphere and theming, the grand finale in a cemetery \u2014 all of this packaged together is unbeatable (although Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance make overtake it one day). The Haunted Mansion is the best ride at WDW; its\u2019 a year-round Halloween haunt for the entire family.\n\nInsider Tip: As I learned from my family, when the ride shows a wait time of 13 minutes, that means there\u2019s no wait at all.\n\nBy John Soltes / Publisher / John@HollywoodSoapbox.com\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.\n\nPhoto by John Soltes.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into The Walt Disney Co's (DIS, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-04, The Walt Disney Co's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $58.08. It's currently trading at a price of $110.82. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -90.81%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. The Walt Disney Co's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $5.03 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.6%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = -4.70%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 23.9 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 7.79 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 58.08\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $54.08. This valuation indicates that the The Walt Disney Co is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -104.92%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

But in January, the Central Florida Disney park could see its first snow since 1977.The first of several cold fronts expected to hit Florida the first part of January has arrived, reports USA Today. Cold fronts are heading for Florida, bringing a blast of arctic temperatures to the region. But the main question is- will snow affect one of Florida's top tourist destinations?Though many weather forecasters currently don't think it is likely that snow will fall in the Sunshine State as multiple cold fronts move through the region in the next week or so, some believe there is a slight chance for some Florida residents to see snowfall.An Arctic blast is set to invade Florida, bringing freezing temperatures that threaten to shut down Disney World in the first few weeks of January, according to Daily Mail.According to a report in The Palm Beach Post, cold temperatures could last in Florida through Saturday, January 11, and Sunday, January 12. Temperatures in some areas could dip into the teens in northern parts of the state and 20s in central communities.\"If the blast is intense enough during the second week of January, then it\u2019s possible some people in Florida can see some snowflakes,\" said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Michael Doll, according to USA Today.According to reports, the Sunshine State is preparing for a historic arctic blast in the first week of January. According to meteorologists, including Brooks Garner (@BrooksWeather on X/Twitter), temperatures will spike in the 80s this week but plummet from January 7 to January 13.Lows could plummet to the 20s \u201cor colder\u201d in the evenings, with high daytime temperatures in the 40s and 50s. The worst winter weather is expected to hit during the Walt Disney World Resort marathon weekend, from January 8 to January 12, according to fan site Inside the Magic.Walt Disney World Resort's water parks often shut down colder weather during the winter months, and guests are encouraged to check the My Disney Experience app to ensure their desired destination is still open. Right now, Disney\u2019s Typhoon Lagoon Water Park is temporarily closed for refurbishment, but Disney\u2019s Blizzard Beach Water Park is welcoming guests.Although Walt Disney World Resort hasn\u2019t made a statement about the upcoming winter weather, Blizzard Beach is likely to close when the temperatures drop. The cold front could also impact thousands of theme park visitors with flight cancellations, worsened road conditions, and more.Meteorologists are unsure if it will snow in Central Florida, but they haven\u2019t ruled it out. Snowfall in the Orlando area in January 2025 would mark the first in 48 years since a modest- 0.05-ince snowfall in January of 1977.According to the National Weather Service, the first cold front moves in on Friday, January 3, triggering \u201ca rapid, but short, cooling trend\u201d leading into Saturday, January 4. A second \u201cstrong\u201d cold front will move in around the middle of next week. But the NWS said they believe conditions will remain \u201cmostly dry\u201d across South Florida.\u201cIt is possible that some of the coldest temperatures to date could be experienced if this were to fully materialize and follow current model trends,\u201d the agency said.The last measurable snow fell in Florida in January 2014, USA Today reported. A low pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico could muster up enough moisture to help bring snow to the region, according to CW affiliate WJXT.Snow has not fallen in South Florida since 1977, when snow was measured there for the first time, according to The Palm Beach Post and WOFL.",

            "content": "The 12 Best Attractions at Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom\n\nThe Magic Kingdom wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first theme park, but as the heart of the sprawling vacation destination known as Walt Disney World, it\u2019s the most important of the 12 parks that bear the Disney name around the globe. It\u2019s a bigger, busier version of the original Disneyland, with variations on many of the same attractions, and some original additions of its own. (Curiously, though, despite a much larger footprint, it has less total attractions than Disneyland.) It might not be as quaint or as cute as the Anaheim original, but there\u2019s something to be said for being overwhelmed, especially when it comes to the significantly larger castle that sits at the center of the park.\n\nAs usual when I write a list like this, I\u2019m considering the current state of the attractions at the time of publication. Rides naturally wear down over time and need periodic maintenance and upgrades to offer the kind of experiences they\u2019re designed for. If a ride has been neglected for too long, and it\u2019s too hard to ignore, that\u2019ll hurt it on this list, even if it\u2019s one of the best concepts to ever come out of Imagineering. Case in point: the second entry on this list, rocketing in at number 11. Also, some of the best rides at Disneyland exist in inferior form at the Magic Kingdom. The original It\u2019s a Small World is an amazing work of art; the version you\u2019ll find at Disney World is fine, but a notable step down from Disneyland\u2019s, and that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t make the list. That\u2019s the same reason the truncated Florida version of Pirates of the Caribbean lands midway on this list, instead of near the top.\n\nAlso, yes, Magic Kingdom\u2019s newest roller coaster, Tron: Lightcycle Run, opened in 2023. I have ridden it. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s good. It doesn\u2019t make this list. I\u2019m a sucker for the classics, but also Tron\u2019s just a little too short to qualify. It comes to a stop right when it should be discovering its next gear. It\u2019s absolutely worth riding but you should do everything else on this list first.\n\n12. Tom Sawyer Island\n\nI\u2019ve been reluctant to add Tom Sawyer Island to this list in the past because it\u2019s not really a single attraction. It\u2019s billed that way, but it\u2019s more like a distinct area with its own set of attractions\u2014like Tomorrowland or Frontierland, only with a number of walkthrough exhibits instead of any rides. I hate to not give it its due, though. Transporting guests to a different time or place is one of the chief aims of a theme park, and Tom Sawyer Island probably does that better than any other part of the Magic Kingdom. Once you step onto the raft that takes you across the Rivers of America, it\u2019s like you\u2019re leaving the Magic Kingdom altogether to go explore this secretive little island based on Mark Twain\u2019s book. Once there you can walk through a working mill, bounce along a barrel bridge, explore creepy caves, and, on the busiest days of the summer, maybe even get a sandwich at the seasonal restaurant Aunt Polly\u2019s Dockside Inn. The centerpiece is Fort Wilderness, an 1800s-style wooden fort with a number of rooms to explore, a handful of animatronics, and a hidden underground exit. You\u2019ll likely spend more time than you expect on Tom Sawyer Island, especially if you\u2019re able to lose yourself in the fantasy of visiting an older version of America (which, I acknowledge, is not a fantasy everybody shares, and not necessarily a healthy one for anybody to share). If you can get past the thorny historical issues, and approach Tom Sawyer Island for what it is, you\u2019ll understand why Tom Sawyer Island is so beloved by longtime Disney fans.\n\n11. Space Mountain\n\nSpace Mountain is one of the very best rides to ever exist at a Disney theme park. Unfortunately the current state of the Disney World version makes it hard to recommend. The basic concept\u2014an indoor roller coaster in the dark, surrounded by stars and the vastness of space, as cool sci-fi music plays in the background\u2014is an all-time winner. When it\u2019s not maintained well, though, you wind up with what you\u2019ll find at Magic Kingdom. The coaster feels bumpy and rickety, the stars are dim and hard to see, and these cars don\u2019t have the on-board speakers you\u2019ll find in Disneyland. So it\u2019s not as smooth as the California version, and the effects and audio aren\u2019t nearly as vivid and powerful.\n\nAnd yet it still makes this list.\n\nAgain: the concept is timeless and will bewitch anybody in love with the cosmos and the idea of space travel. And for coaster fans, well, it\u2019s far from the fastest or most extreme roller coaster out there, but the darkness makes it unpredictable, which amplifies its thrills. Even the least impressive Space Mountain is still hard to pass up, and if you\u2019ve never ridden any of the others, you won\u2019t realize how much this one falls short. Magic Kingdom\u2019s Space Mountain could be much better, but the park would be far worse if this coaster didn\u2019t exist at all.\n\n10. PeopleMover\n\nThe PeopleMover doesn\u2019t seem like much to a lot of people. Originally it was less of a ride than an example of a potential mass transit system that Disney was working on. (It would\u2019ve been a crucial component of the original EPCOT, which wasn\u2019t a theme park but an actual planned city that was never built.) Many view it simply as a way to get off your feet for a few minutes during a day at the park. You won\u2019t realize how much you\u2019ll miss the PeopleMover until you go to a park that doesn\u2019t have one, though. Disneyland shut its PeopleMover down in 1995, and Disney\u2019s other castle parks never had one. That\u2019s a shame: this is a classic piece of Disney history that ties the whole Tomorrowland concept together and helps distinguish it from the other lands in the park.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t ridden them before, imagine a fleet of small trams on a conveyor belt that never stops moving. They whisk you throughout all of Tomorrowland, offering a glimpse of the other attractions in the area, including a nice preview of Space Mountain\u2019s lift hill. It isn\u2019t just a relaxing detour that rarely has a line: it\u2019s an attraction that perfectly fits the futuristic city theme of Tomorrowland, while also reiterating that theme parks aren\u2019t just a collection of rides but one large, intertwined experience made up of smaller, individual experiences. Oh, it also lets you look at an early prototype for that original EPCOT concept, which is fascinating for fans of Disney history.\n\n9. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train\n\nThis Snow White-themed roller coaster has consistently been one of the most popular rides in the park since it opened in 2014. It deserves its popularity, but it also could have been so much more. The extreme wait times are only part of why it\u2019s not higher on this list; the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train is two-thirds of an amazing ride that ends abruptly just as it should be hitting its peak.\n\nAs a coaster it\u2019s nothing too exciting\u2014it\u2019s basically a family-friendly ride that\u2019s less intense than either Space Mountain or Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. It has one novel gimmick, in that the cars sway back and forth as they speed around the track. The best part of the ride is the first of two set pieces featuring Audio-Animatronics. The train slows to a crawl as it heads inside the mine, where the Seven Dwarfs are singing \u201cDig-a-Dig-Dig\u201d and messing around with some brightly colored gems. It\u2019s a beautiful real-life recreation of a movie scene that people have been watching for over 80 years now. At the very end of the ride you pass by the cottage that Snow White and the Dwarfs live in; they\u2019re dancing inside, although it can be hard to get a good look as the train pulls into the station. You can see an Animatronic of the Evil Queen in her witch guise standing outside the cottage door at the very end of the ride; it\u2019s the only time you see her, which is a big change from the old Snow White dark ride, which featured the movie\u2019s villain at almost every turn.\n\nWhat\u2019s here is fantastic, but it\u2019s such a short ride, and one that always requires a very long wait, unless you\u2019re able to get a Fast Pass online weeks in advance. It simply feels unfinished, showing only part of the story and suddenly ending before Snow White even meets the Witch. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train is an example of the world-class work Disney Imagineers are capable of producing, but also of Disney\u2019s unflattering stinginess when it comes to budgeting new projects. With a little bit more money and an extra 30 seconds or so of ride, this could\u2019ve been one of the best Disney rides of all time.\n\n8. Peter Pan\u2019s Flight\n\nIf you like the classic Fantasyland dark rides that can be found at Disneyland, and that used to make up Magic Kingdom, you might be disappointed today. The original Snow White ride is gone, Mr. Toad\u2019s Wild Ride was ripped out in \u201998, and the Pinocchio and Alice in Wonderland rides from Disneyland were never built in the Magic Kingdom. Peter Pan\u2019s Flight is here, though, and it\u2019s just as magical\u2014and popular\u2014as the California original.\n\nPeter Pan\u2019s Flight is a beautiful dark ride that flies you through the full story of Disney\u2019s Peter Pan aboard replica pirate ships. The night-time view of London spreading out beneath you remains one of the most striking visuals in any Disney ride, and the Never Land portion is just as memorable. Magic Kingdom\u2019s Fantasyland lacks much of the charm of Disneyland\u2019s, but Peter Pan\u2019s Flight is equally great in both parks. The only problem is the extreme lines you\u2019re likely to encounter\u2014this is always one of the most popular rides at the park.\n\n7. Jungle Cruise\n\nWhen I originally ranked the best rides at the Magic Kingdom, I had two whole paragraphs about how parts of the Jungle Cruise were outdated and racist and needed to be changed. Disney finally removed the most questionable scenes from the ride last year, without losing either its evocation of an exotic 1930s adventure or its 1960s family-friendly corniness. It didn\u2019t lose anything with the changes, and in fact has gained a great deal from them, primarily the ability to enjoy the ride without thinking \u201coh geez, that\u2019s racist as heck\u201d two or three times along the way. (Thankfully they didn\u2019t add any overt references to the 2021 movie based on the ride, which was like if a bot was fed Indiana Jones and The African Queen and spat out 140 minutes of incoherent CGI with The Rock in it.)\n\nThe Jungle Cruise has seen many changes over the years, but conceptually the experience has remained largely unchanged since the early \u201860s, when jokes were originally added to the spiel at Disneyland. That\u2019s the version that opened alongside the Magic Kingdom in 1971. I wouldn\u2019t use the word \u201cfunny\u201d to describe those jokes (although your five-year-old might disagree) but the entire package remains surprisingly charming. It\u2019s a quaint glimpse into the past, at the kind of family-friendly entertainment that our parents might\u2019ve enjoyed when they were young, and hopefully a ride that\u2019ll never change too much.\n\n6. Walt Disney\u2019s Carousel of Progress\n\nHere\u2019s another classic Disney attraction in desperate need of an update. Walt Disney himself oversaw the creation of this Audio-Animatronic look at how technology changed the typical American home throughout the 20th century, which debuted as a pavilion at the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair before relocating to Disneyland and then the Magic Kingdom. It\u2019s not a ride, but a show inside a revolving theater. You sit and watch vignettes from four different time periods, starting with the 1900s and then moving ahead 20 years per scene. The fourth vignette was originally set in the \u201860s, when the attraction was built, but was updated five times between 1967 and 1993 to keep pace with recent technological developments. That final scene is now incredibly outdated, full of \u201890s fashion and a supposedly high-tech videogame that looks like something you\u2019d play on a Sega 32X. The solution should be to add a permanent \u201880s or \u201890s vignette, and then end on a fifth scene that can be easily and cheaply updated every few years. Failing that, they should just revert it back to its original \u201860s state, and end it when the attraction was built. It\u2019d be less about progress than a time capsule at that point, but it\u2019s probably more practical than having to account for the ceaseless march of time.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why an entry so high on this list would start with a thorough summary of its problems. It\u2019s only because they\u2019re unmistakable to modern eyes. The quaintness and charm of the first three scenes smash hard against that \u201890s update, which is portrayed as the present by the narration. Even just updating that script to reflect that this final tableaux is decidedly out of date would be a nice improvement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: despite all that, the Carousel of Progress is still a beautiful summation of what Tomorrowland (and, later, EPCOT\u2019s Future World) was intended to be. It\u2019s a celebration of how technology has helped make our lives better. That might sound naive today, but at a time when tech companies try to disrupt society not to make life easier but simply to make money, it\u2019s good to be reminded how beneficial technology can actually be, and how much it advanced our way of life in the 20th century. Also each vignette is a wonderfully designed diorama of the past, with classic Audio-Animatronics and great music from the Sherman Brothers. Disney himself supposedly considered this his all-time favorite attraction that his company ever developed, and it\u2019s easy to see why: it was a technological marvel at the time, suffused with midcentury optimism and a \u201cwe can do anything\u201d spirit right out of the Space Age. That\u2019s all still here, even if the final scene is so outdated.\n\n5. Pirates of the Caribbean\n\nThe Magic Kingdom version of Pirates is vastly inferior to the original in Disneyland. It\u2019s a shortened version that was built in a hurry to meet demand after the park first opened in the early \u201870s, and was never actually supposed to exist in Disney World. It\u2019s missing so much of what makes Disneyland\u2019s so great. It doesn\u2019t have the serene twilit opening behind the Blue Bayou restaurant, its Dead Man\u2019s Cove is noticeably shorter, and the entire final scene in the village storehouse is gone. This is how great Pirates is, though, both in its concept and execution: despite missing all that, this diminished version still one of the best rides at the Magic Kingdom. Most of the ride\u2019s iconic moments are here, from the fortress bombardment, to the (now changed) auction scene, to the three prisoners trying to coax the dog into giving them the key to their cell. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing (as I didn\u2019t know until I was in my 30s), Magic Kingdom\u2019s version of Pirates is amazing. And if you do, what\u2019s here is still tremendous.\n\n4. Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure\n\nTiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure is a joyous celebration that captures the spirit of New Orleans while continuing Tiana\u2019s story from The Princess and the Frog, and is an ideal replacement for Splash Mountain, preserving its ride system and legacy of adorable animatronic critters while establishing a more immersive, more defined sense of time and place. It\u2019s a welcome addition to the Magic Kingdom, and will no doubt be one of the most popular attractions there, especially on those blazing Orlando summer days. There are some technical issues that still need to be worked out, but when it\u2019s running smoothly\u2014as it was when I rode it at a recent media preview\u2014it\u2019s one of the best attractions at Disney World.\n\nIf your favorite part of Splash Mountain was getting wet and falling down a 50 foot drop, don\u2019t worry: the ride system is the same. On a purely physical level it\u2019s the same log flume ride it\u2019s always been. Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure elevates that experience with state-of-the-art animatronics that move, talk, and emote with a surprising level of realism; an exuberant new soundtrack that improves on Splash Mountain\u2019s; and a firm commitment to celebrating the unique culture of New Orleans and the people who make it.\n\nThe music might not be as instantly familiar to older Disney fans as some of the songs from Splash Mountain, but it improves on the old ride by making the soundtrack the single most important part of its immersive environment. The music of Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure is the foundation for everything else, driving both the loose story and helping it conjure the joyous character of New Orleans. It uses a handful of songs from The Princess and the Frog, with highlights including \u201cDig a Little Deeper\u201d and \u201cDown in New Orleans,\u201d and introduces a fine new song \u201cSpecial Spice\u201d during the celebratory final scene. One stretch of the ride is driven by a fantastic zydeco number that sounds like nothing else heard in a theme park ride before, and that really sells the illusion that you\u2019re riding through the Louisiana bayou. Music is one of the most crucial aspects of a theme park ride, and can easily elevate a good experience into something genuinely great. Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure is more proof of that.\n\n3. Walt Disney\u2019s Enchanted Tiki Room\n\nThere are obviously some deep and legitimate problems with turning real-world human cultures into cartoons. I readily admit that. I also fall in love with the Enchanted Tiki Room more every time I visit it, purely for the unabashed, innocent schmaltz of the whole thing. If you want to feel blasted back to your grandparents\u2019 time, just check out this show, in which a bunch of mechanical birds and wall decorations put on a show full of Borscht belt humor, bad stereotypes and cheesy songs. The first attraction to use Audio-Animatronics, it\u2019s another timeless Disney classic, and one that will hopefully always have a home within the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland. There\u2019s also almost nothing better for giving your feet a break.\n\n2. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad\n\nI\u2019ve been riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad for over 40 years\u2014it was the first roller coaster I ever had the courage to ride\u2014and yet I admire it more and more every time I ride it. It was always second to Space Mountain for me, both because I tend to like space stuff more than cowboy business, and because the darkened nature of Tomorrowland\u2019s major ride makes it more thrilling. I would still rank a well-maintained Space Mountain above a well-maintained Big Thunder, but that gap is growing closer by the year. And it\u2019s all because of the theme part of a theme park.\n\nSpace Mountain fits its theme perfectly, but so does Big Thunder. And Big Thunder is simply a far brighter and more active space, one that has to cram details into every corner and every part of the track. Big Thunder is a beautiful synthesis of aesthetics and practical design choices, from the way the mountains that the track weaves through seem to have been there long before the ride was built, to how there\u2019s almost always a small detail or bit of visual storytelling to look at whenever the train isn\u2019t roaring hard through a turn or speeding down a hill. Big Thunder turns a roller coaster into an almost likelike journey through a specific time and place, making it a masterpiece of theme park design. And as great as the Magic Kingdom version is, the one at Disneyland Paris is even better.\n\n1. Haunted Mansion\n\nIt pains me to say this, as a kid who grew up in Florida and feels a strong tie to Disney World, but Haunted Mansion is the only ride at both Disneyland and Magic Kingdom where the Florida version is better\u2014and just barely.\n\nFlorida\u2019s gets the nod for a couple of reasons. First off, it has an interactive queue full of whimsical games and gadgets. This is deeply controversial among some Disney fans, of course\u2014these additions are relatively new, and every single change Disney makes will upset somebody. They have the same darkly comic sensibility of many of the gags found inside the ride, though, and anything that gets guests to interact with their surroundings instead of their phones is a good idea, in my book.\n\nSecondly, this Haunted Mansion features every part of the original (even the long-lost Hatbox Ghost), and more. The stormy hallway you walk through in Anaheim, with the framed portraits that turn demonic when lightning strikes, is incorporated into the ride itself, as is the library with the busts of the greatest ghost writers the literary world has ever known. There\u2019s also an entirely original room that resembles an M.C. Escher print, with staircases winding in all directions, and spectral footprints that defy gravity.\n\nThe kicker, though, is that this version of the Haunted Mansion exists year-round. You will always hear the original Ghost Host, tour the original dinner party with the creepy organ music and dueling portraits, and wind up in the original graveyard as \u201cGrim Grinning Ghosts\u201d blasts through the room. Disneyland turns its unique spook show into a Nightmare Before Christmas tie-in for almost a full third of the year. As fun as that version is, it pales in comparison to the Disney original. (Seriously, if you only plan one visit to any Disney park in your entire life\u2014basically, if you\u2019re my wife\u2019s family when she was young\u2014do not go to Disneyland between September and January. You\u2019ll miss out on the real Haunted Mansion experience, one of the most perfect pieces of art ever made by this company.)\n\nHaunted Mansion is not just one of the best theme park rides ever designed, but a beloved piece of American pop culture, and even though it wasn\u2019t the first, Magic Kingdom\u2019s version of it is the best.\n\nSenior editor Garrett Martin writes about videogames, comedy, travel, theme parks, wrestling, and anything else that gets in his way.

            "content": "As many of the Disney short films from the studio\u2019s early days near a century (or more!) in age, slowly but surely each one enters the public domain. Last year, it was headline news when Steamboat Willie and that version of Mickey Mouse became available for all to use.\n\nNow in 2025, a number of other Mickey Mouse shorts and Silly Symphonies are entering public domain, including the first ever Mickey Mouse cartoon to be animated, Plane Crazy and the first Silly Symphony, The Skeleton Dance. Take a look at all 19 below.\n\nThe Gallopin\u2019 Gaucho\n\nFollowing Plane Crazy but before Steamboat Willie, The Gallopin\u2019 Gaucho is the second Mickey Mouse short to be created and animated. Completed in August 1928 as a silent film, the short was not released in order to work on Steamboat Willie. The Gallopin' Gaucho was released, now with sound, after Steamboat Willie on December 30 of 1928.\n\nThe short was intended as a parody of Douglas Fairbanks's The Gaucho, a film first released on November 21, 1927. Similar to the original source material, the events of the short take place in the Pampas of Argentina with Mickey cast as the titular gaucho.\n\nIn the short, Mickey is introduced as he is on his way to a local bar and restaurant. He enters the establishment with the apparent intent to relax with some drinking and smoking. However, thanks to details on the wall, it is clear the Mickey is a bandit or a crook as we see a wanted sign for Mickey saying El gaucho.\n\nAlready at the bar are the resident barmaid and dancer Minnie Mouse and a fellow customer - Pete - who is also introduced as a wanted outlaw.\n\nMinnie performs the tango and salsa, and both customers start flirting with her. Pete then attempts to put an early ending to their emerging rivalry by proceeding in kidnapping her. Mickey gives chase and soon catches up to his rival, where they then proceed in challenging each other to a sword duel. Of course, Mickey wins, in this case by covering Pete's head with a chamber pot he pulls out from under a bed.\n\nIt is also important to note that this version is the full, uncensored version of The Gallopin\u2019 Gaucho, as it was when it was released. At the time, cartoons weren\u2019t considered a largely family or children\u2019s medium, rather just another type of filmmaking. As such, the short contains a racial stereotype as well as Mickey Mouse smoking a cigarette and drinking beer.\n\nThe Barn Dance\n\nIn the same vein as the saying \u201cIf you\u2019re not first, you\u2019re last\", The Barn Dance is oft overlooked because it was the second animated short with synchronized sound, trailing behind Steamboat Willie. Like Steamboat Willie and unlike our next entry, The Barn Dance was planned as a sound cartoon, and there are many sound gags, including Mickey using a passing duck as a horn for his car. The Barn Dance also demonstrates the studio's increasing facility with mixing cartoon action with musical rhythm.\n\nIn the short, the titular event brings together Minnie Mouse and her two suitors: Mickey and Pete. The latter two and their vehicles are first seen arriving at Minnie's house in an attempt to pick her up for the dance, where Mickey turns up in his horse-cart while Pete in a newly purchased automobile.\n\nMinnie initially chooses Pete to drive her to the dance but the automobile unexpectedly breaks down and she resorts to accepting Mickey's invitation. They are later seen dancing together, but Mickey proves to be a rather clumsy dancer as he repeatedly steps on Minnie's feet. She consequently turns down his invitation for a second dance. She instead accepts that of Pete, who proves to be a better dancing partner.\n\nTo remedy this, Mickey places a balloon in his shorts to allow him to be \u201clight on his feet.\" When he asks Minnie to dance once again, she accepts and is surprised to find his dancing skills to have apparently improved.\n\nPete soon discovers Mickey's trick and points it out to Minnie, who is disgusted by this attempt at deception. As a result, she leaves Mickey and resumes dancing with Pete, leaving a defeated Mickey crying on the floor.\n\nNotably, this is a cartoon in which Mickey DOES NOT end up with Minnie, with her choosing the adversarial Pete instead.\n\nIn 2013, Walt Disney Animation Studios released a new short, Get A Horse! Which borrowed the look of Pete\u2019s clothing and his car from The Barn Dance.\n\nPlane Crazy\n\nHere it is folks, the short that will always be a frustrating piece of trivia for those at a local pub or even on a cruise - unless of course, you\u2019re in the know. The cartoon is the first animated project that stars Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, finished entirely in secret as Walt\u2019s contracts surrounding Oswald the Lucky Rabbit were being finished. Plane Crazy was originally a silent film, and it was given a test screening to a theater audience and potential distributors on May 15, 1928, but failed to get a distributor. The screening took place a little over six months before the debut of Disney\u2019s first cartoon in sound which also starred Mickey Mouse, Steamboat Willie. Willie was a huge success and Plane Crazy was officially released as a sound cartoon on March 17, 1929. Despite being the first project animated with Mickey Mouse, it is actually the fourth Mickey short film to be given a wide release after Steamboat Willie, The Gallopin' Gaucho and The Barn Dance.\n\nIn the short, Mickey is attempting to fly an airplane while doing a caricature of then-relevant Charles Lindbergh. After building his own airplane, he does a simulation to ensure that the plane is safe for flight, but the flight fails, destroying the plane. Mickey then takes a roadster, a turkey's tail and the remains of his plane to create a new plane, asking Minnie to join him for its first flight after she presents him with a horseshoe for good luck. Together, they take an out-of-control flight with exaggerated, impossible situations that also features an appearance from Clarabelle Cow.\n\nInterestingly, the silent version of the film is already in the public domain as of last year, considering its screening in 1928. Now, the sound version is available as well.\n\nSo the next time you\u2019re at a trivia contest, pay attention to the phrasing of the question.\n\nThe Opry House\n\nThe Opry House is notable for introducing Mickey's signature white gloves in animation, which had previously been seen in title cards and posters before ever appearing in motion.\n\nThe cartoon starts with the opening of a theater and Mickey Mouse sweeping with a broom that he is using as an instrument and a dance partner. The band takes over, with a large variety of short gags occurring throughout, and Mickey becomes the star of the show, taking on the multiple roles of a vaudeville star. The cartoon ends with a humorous fight between Mickey, a piano and a stool, and his interactions are highly stylized in order to capture the essence of what a vaudeville performance should be.\n\nFans might also catch on that Mickey\u2019s performances are synced with music, some of which is known, including \"Yankee Doodle\", Sergei Rachmaninoff's \"Prelude in C-sharp Minor (Op. 3/2)\", Georges Bizet's Carmen, the Klezmer tune \"Chusen Kala Mazel Tov\", and \"Goodnight, Ladies\". The short also marks the first appearance of \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\" by Franz Liszt in a cartoon.\n\nThis helps make The Opry House an early predecessor to what would come later in the Silly Symphonies, and further down the line with Fantasia. The concept was also borrowed by other studios, including the Merrie Melodies from Warner Bros., as well as other Tom & Jerry and Woody Woodpecker shorts.\n\nBefore this short entered the public domain, it had previously only been available as part of the Walt Disney Treasures DVD set, Mickey Mouse in Black & White Volume 2.\n\nWhen the Cat's Away\n\nNormally viewed as the size of all their friends, this short features Mickey and Minnie as actual mice-sized mice, where the antagonistic Tom Cat is quite large in comparison. After Tom Cat leaves his house, Mickey organizes all his mice friends to break into the cat's house. Once inside, Mickey and Minnie play the piano by dancing on the keys and, later, others play some of the cat's musical instruments and records (using themselves as the speaker and stylus).\n\nWhen the Cat's Away recycled the premise from one of Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks' earlier films, a 1925 Alice Comedies short called Alice Rattled by Rats. Although the titular cat signs his name as \"Tom Cat,\" the character is actually known as Kat Nipp. Like Pete, this foe of Mickey's goes by multiple names.\n\nThe Barnyard Battle\n\nAs the title implies, this short features a battle between an invading army of cats and an army of mice trying to defend their homes and farm.Pete is depicted as a leading soldier of one army, and Mickey as a conscript of the other one. Before joining the army, Mickey has to pass a physical examination and go through training, where we see Mickey given a machine gun and sent to battle. Mickey's combat efforts are comical in depiction but prove effective enough in forcing the enemy to retreat. In the end, Mickey smacks a line of advancing soldiers on the head with a mallet, and is hailed as a hero by his fellow soldiers.\n\nThis is notably Mickey Mouse\u2019s first appearance as a soldier, and the physical examination scene has since often been edited out, often noted as being disturbing. However, this scene is often pointed to as being the most memorable of the short film.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that one of Disney's cartoons sent the main character to war - Julius the Cat calls an army together in the 1926 Alice Comedies short Alice's Little Parade, and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit goes to war in the 1927 cartoon Great Guns!\n\nAlso of note, The mouse officer shouting \"Company, forward march!\" is the first mammal character in the Mickey Mouse cartoons to speak a full sentence. Before this, characters have only communicated in single-syllable sounds and laughs, or in the case of Minnie Mouse, the greeting, \"Yoo-Hoo!\"\n\nThe Barnyard Battle also caused a bit of controversy on its international release. Walt Disney served as an ambulance driver in France during World War I, and the cats wear helmets that evoke Germany's helmets from that same period. As such, the short was considered offensive in Germany and was banned. In spite of this, Mickey Mouse became popular in Germany before the second World War broke out.\n\nThe Plowboy\n\nSet entirely on a farm, Mickey and Minnie find whimsy through chores. As Mickey plows the field, Minnie milks the cow.\n\nAs the title implies, Mickey is depicted as a farmer, first seen with his horse while plowing a field. Then Minnie comes along with her cow. She has Mickey milk the cow for her. Mickey eventually manages to present Minnie with a full bucket of milk. At another point, the horse is stung by a bee, panics and starts galloping. By the time the horse calms down again, the plow has just broken. By the end, Mickey resorts to using a pig as a plow.\n\nAlthough the horse in this short doesn't bear much resemblance to the Horace Horsecollar we know today, studio publicity in 1933 claimed The Plowboy as his first appearance, debuting on June 28th, 1929. The cow in this short is also Clarabelle Cow who, like Horace, would eventually become as anthropomorphic as Mickey and Minnie (Clarabelle's debut was in \"Steamboat Willie\" where she was, again, a regular cow).\n\nThe Plowboy marks Minnie Mouse's first time wearing gloves in animation. She was also voiced in this short not by Walt Disney, as she had been before, but by Marjorie Ralston, who was reluctantly recruited for the part from her normal job in Disney's Ink & Paint Department. Voice work wasn't something she particularly enjoyed, and she is only known to have voiced Minnie in 3 shorts, all of which were released in 1929.\n\nThe Karnival Kid\n\nWhile we heard more dialogue than before in The Barnyard Battle, The Karnival Kid is especially important as it marks the first time we hear Mickey himself say actual words. Those words: \u201cHot Dogs! Hot Dogs!\" would serve as the basis for one of Mickey\u2019s trademark phrases - \u201cHot Dog!\" and also later became the theme song for Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.\n\nWhile Walt Disney had been squeaking for Mickey since Steamboat Willie, in The Karnival Kid, he only voices Minnie Mouse. Mickey's first words ever spoken were actually provided by composer Carl W. Stalling.\n\nThe Karnival Kid is broken into two distinct segments. The first segment features Mickey selling hot dogs at a carnival. The second segment is set later that night and features Mickey, accompanied by two cats, in a moonlight serenade.\n\nLike many of Mickey's earliest shorts, The Karnival Kid reuses a lot of gags and even the premise from the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit short All Wet. It would be recycled again, outside of Disney, when Ub Iwerks left and helped the Flip the Frog series in the 1932 short Circus\"(distributed by MGM).\n\nAlso of note, the short features a moment where Mickey, in lieu of tipping his hat, actually tips his ears to Minnie Mouse. A moment that is said to have inspired the creation of the Mouse Ears hat that is still available for purchase to this day.\n\nThe 2013 Mickey Mouse short, New York Weenie, also shares a number of themes similar to that of The Karnival Kid. All of this combined makes The Karnival Kid a fairly significant animated short in the Disney canon. That said, prior to this, it has only been available on the home release of Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Black and White.\n\nThe Skeleton Dance\n\nThe first entry in Walt Disney\u2019s Silly Symphony series, The Skeleton Dance was produced and directed by Walt Disney himself, and animated by Ub Iwerks. In the short film, four human skeletons dance and make music around a spooky graveyard (making it a modern film example of medieval European \"danse macabre\").\n\nWalt asked an old friend, Carl Stalling, to produce the soundtracks for his first Mickey Mouse cartoons (The Gallopin\u2019 Gaucho and Plane Crazy) where Stalling suggest to Walt creating a series of \"musical novelty\" cartoons combining music and animation (which became the genesis for the Silly Symphony series) and reportedly pitched an idea about skeletons dancing in a graveyard.\n\nThe short is full of visual gags as the skeletons emerge and start dancing, including one where a skeleton takes two bones and plays its partner's spine and head to produce music. Another skeleton dances alone and then plays a cat's tail as if it were a violin.\n\nThe short is considered a classic, and has been released on various forms of home media over the years. In 2023, a remastered version of The Skeleton Dance arrived on Disney+. Stalling would eventually join Disney's studio as staff composer.\n\nMickey's Follies\n\nLong before \"Mickey Mouse March\" and \"The Hot Dog Song,\" there was \"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo,\" which originated in Mickey's tenth short, Mickey's Follies. Released on August 28th, 1929, the short found Mickey Mouse and his barnyard pals putting on a Ziegfield Follies-style review.\n\nDirected by Ub Iwerks and Wilfred Jackson, Mickey's Follies was Disney's second attempt at synchronizing words with animation, this time through song. It was no easy task, and Mickey's mouth has more teeth than he later would, as this process was still trial and error.\n\nThe song, \"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo,\" was Disney's first original song, with shorts prior to this comprised of instrumental versions of well-known ditties. It was written by Carl Stalling and Walt Disney, both of whom also sing on this version. However, it's Carl Stalling who sings for Mickey, while Walt provides Minnie's titular \"yoo hoo\"'s. The song was intended to become Mickey Mouse's theme song (as evidenced by the chicken who advertises it as such), and an instrumental version would introduce most of Mickey's shorts going forward through 1933.\n\nThe song also became the anthem of the Mickey Mouse Club, local chapters of fans who would gather in movie theaters to rewatch the shorts.\n\nMickey's piano-top dance will be familiar to frequent viewers of Disney Channel in the 90s, where he appeared inside a Mickey-shaped TV in bumpers and chyrons.\n\nEl Terrible Toreador\n\nThe second SillySymphony was directed by Walt Disney himself, released on September 26th, 1929. Georges Bizet's 1875 opera Carmen was primarily used to underscore the story, set in Spain.\n\nA humble toreador and a wealthy man fight over a restaurant server. When the toreador enters the ring at the bullfight, he is cheered on by the waitress as the wealthy man subtly carries out a plot to make him look like a fool.\n\nEl Terrible Toreador was successful in its initial run, but the increasing quality of the Silly Symphony series has led to it being largely forgotten today, especially in the wake of The Skeleton Dance. It doesn't help that the premise and antics of the short are so similar to the more polished output from the Mickey Mouse series. Aside from the toreador destroying the bull by pulling out his innards, you can easily see the three main characters being played by Mickey, Pete, and Minnie without much structural change.\n\nIn fact, that very scene with the bull is what landed it in the \u201cIn The Vault\" section of the Walt Disney Treasures: More Silly Symphonies, Volume 2 DVD, which was the only home media release of the short.\n\nMickey's Choo-Choo\n\nThe cartoon opens with Mickey piloting an anthropomorphic steam engine, ringing his bell and blowing the engine's whistle. An early showing of Walt\u2019s love of trains.\n\nAs the engine and its coal tender back to collect a boxcar, the engine rests with Mickey, its engineer, fuelling it, and feeding his engine with coal from the tender. As the engine eats too much coal and burps, Mickey decides to have some spaghetti, until Minnie comes along.\n\nMinnie plays a musical song (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Humoresque) while Mickey does the same. As Mickey looks at his watch, only to realize that they are late, he yells 'All aboard!' to the engine, which whistles in cheerful response after Mickey gets on board. While climbing a hill, the engine ends up having problems, with a finale sequence that features a runaway train car that runs into a cow, and explodes into a tree. In the final shot, Mickey and Minnie ride a handcar into the sunset.\n\nSome of the gags are pulled from or reminiscent of the Oswald short, Trolley Troubles, and the closing shot of Mickey and Minnie on the handcar inspired a famous toy version from Lionel Trains that made so much money that Mickey was known as \"the mouse that saved Lionel.\"\n\nMickey\u2019s Choo-Choo also contains more dialogue from Mickey, featuring more than a couple of words plus the singing of \u201cI\u2019ve Been Working on the Railroad.\"\n\nThe Jazz Fool\n\nLike many of the early Mickey Mouse shorts, The Jazz Fool drew on contemporary pop culture of the late 1920s. The film's title is a play on two popular movies of the era - The Jazz Singer and The Singing Fool. In terms of both plot and substance, The Jazz Fool is very similar to another 1929 Mickey short, The Opry House, which also found Mickey duking it out on stage with a piano.\n\nThe short follows the arrival of Mickey's Big Road Show in town. A calliope carries the star of the show past farms, leading a parade of barnyard animals to attract an audience. Once parked, it's time for the big show. But when Mickey gets carried away at the piano, the piano fights back.\n\nWhile not a lot is remembered specifically about the short, many fans are quick to point out the quality of the personality animation of Mickey. He is often showing his anger, frustration or happiness at what he\u2019s playing on the piano. Well done, simple moves of the eyebrow and eyes, turns of his mouth, or the direction of his nose or shoulders expresses the entire emotion. It\u2019s a very expressive Mickey, part of the evolution of his character over the last few shorts.\n\nSpringtime\n\nThe third Silly Symphonies cartoon (released only days before the stock market crash of 1929) features a cast of Flowers, ladybugs, centipedes, birds, and frogs that dance in time to the usual blend of themes from the light classics.\n\nThe music used in the film includes \"Morning Mood\" from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt, Franz von Blon's \"Whispering Flowers\", Amilcare Ponchielli's music for \"Dance of the Hours\" and Jacques Offenbach's \"Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne.\"\n\nThis cartoon also makes an appearance in the 1961 animated film 101 Dalmatians, when the puppies are watching TV with Jasper and Horace.\n\nAnd, further proving the evolution of music and animation stemming from the Silly Symphonies, one of the music pieces from the latter half of the short would later be reused for the full \"Dance of the Hours\" in Fantasia.\n\nJungle Rhythm\n\nIn Mickey\u2019s 13th short, he wanders into a jungle and comes across several animals, including elephants, monkeys, and lions.\n\nThe short is more spectacle than plot, and also marks the first time that Mickey has left the barnyard or countryside and found himself in a far off jungle - with no explanation given.\n\nA monkey and parrot begin playing a tune on Mickey's accordion, and it turns into a concert for the jungle animals. Mickey dances with a lion, a bear and a pair of monkeys to the tune of Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube. Then two ostriches dance as Mickey plays \"Auld Lang Syne\" on a makeshift saxophone. Mickey continues with \"Aloha 'Oe\", \"Turkey in the Straw\" and \"Yankee Doodle.\"\n\nA hula dance performed by a lion did land the short in the land of censorship in some regions, though it is presented here complete.\n\nDespite the lack of real plot, Jungle Rhythm has a bit of a legacy on its own, providing the inspiration for the first adventure storyline in the Mickey Mouse comic strip in 1930, and generations later as a playable level in the video game, Epic Mickey.\n\nHell's Bells\n\nHell\u2019s Bells, perhaps unsurprisingly, follows Satan and the other devils' happenings in Hell. As part of the Silly Symphonies series, the short features a variety of classical compositions, including \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" by Edvard Grieg, \"Funeral March of a Marionette\" by French composer Charles Gounod, which is familiar also as the theme tune to the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\n\nEven for 1929, the short received mix reviews, with The Film Daily saying \"Few Laughs: Hell's Bells is evidently a follow-up on the success of The Skeleton Dance, but it does not approach that offering in laugh possibilities. It is pretentious as cartoons go. Full of fire and brimstone with a sort of a Jack-and-the-Beanstalk finish that is the best thing in it.\"\n\nThat ending sees a little demon who has revolted against Satan being chased to the edge of a cliff. The little demon hides there as Satan attempts to look for him, but when he attempts this, Satan is kicked off the cliff by the little demon. Satan then tumbles down, grabbing on to a ledge that sees his body stretch out like an accordion. The fire below then tugs at his tail and spanks him (it was 1929!) The fire then drags Satan down, ultimately killing him. The film ends with the fire consuming the screen, and leaving behind a 'The End' card.\n\nThe short is definitely one of the rarer seen, especially when coupled that it was only ever released on home media as part of the Walt Disney Treasures DVD set, More Silly Symphonies Volume 2.\n\nThe Haunted House\n\nThe fourteenth Mickey Mouse cartoon was also the first to take on a horror theme, as we follow Mickey who is trapped in a haunted house and forced to make music.\n\nMickey is constantly startled by bats, spiders, ghosts, and skeletons. At one point, Mickey is cornered by a cloaked figure and several skeletons, prompting him to play the music. When the music stops, Mickey sneaks away and tries to escape but is spotted by the skeletons who try to stop him. As he runs into dead ends and tries to open a door, the door handle is a skeleton hand, who shakes Mickey frantically. A chase ensues, and Mickey eventually falls out of a window. He then encounters more skeletons, including one that pops out from the door of an outhouse who is busy using the toilet. As Mickey runs away terrified, the skeleton shuts the door when Mickey leaves.\n\nThis gag, along with another featuring a chamber pot, both landed the short in some hot water with state censors in some areas.\n\nPlus, with the large amount of skeletons in the short, it comes as no surprise that a small amount of animation was recycled from The Skeleton Dance, although the majority was fresh.\n\nThe short also got an introduction from Leonard Maltin in its only home release, on the Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Black & White Volume 2 DVD set, due to Mickey's \"Mammy!\" impression, which refers to Al Jolson's famous blackface performance, My Mammy. In his intro, Maltin explains the origins of racial stereotypes seen in Disney cartoons of the 30s and 40s.\n\nThe Haunted House paved the way for other, more notable, shorts from Mickey\u2019s rich history, including The Mad Doctor, The Gorilla Mystery, and even decades later with Runaway Brain.\n\nWith the public domain entry above, you can see the full uncensored version.\n\nThe Merry Dwarfs\n\nAnother Silly Symphonies short, The Merry Dwarfs sees the residents of a dwarf village dance as they go about their business and chores while some of them play music. It is a Silly Symphony after all. Some of them played the (shoe-covered) feet of centipedes and grasshoppers with hammers, while others played instruments such as saxophones or drums.\n\nNotably, the short features several groups of dwarves that dance with barrels and beer glasses, continuing their dancing after they have drunk their glasses of beer. A pair of dwarves, dancing on a flower, fall into a barrel of beer and then come out of the barrel drunk and continue dancing while inebriated.\n\nAll to music of the Anvil Chorus from Giuseppe Verdi's 1853 opera Il trovatore.\n\nIt was those scenes of drunken tomfoolery and inebriated shenanigans that landed it in the \u201cIn The Vault\" section of its only home release, once again part of the Walt Disney Treasures: More Silly Symphonies Volume 2.\n\nWild Waves\n\nThe last Mickey Mouse cartoon to be animated by Ub Iwerks, Wild Waves was also the last film that composer Carl Stalling worked in with the Walt Disney Studio.\n\nIn it, we follow Mickey who is now a lifeguard, sitting on his beach chair and playing the banjo to amuse an audience of ducks, pelicans, penguins, and sea lions. Minnie Mouse changes into swimwear of the era and walks to the edge of the beach where a huge wave crashes and drags her out to sea.\n\nMickey rushes to her rescue, swimming through the waves (and midair) to locate her before bringing her back to the beach where more musical fun is had.\n\nSome of the lifeguard gags and the animation of Mickey saving Minnie on the waves in the film were allegedly recycled from an earlier Oswald short, All Wet. The footage of the singing walrus was later reused in the 1930 Silly Symphonies short Arctic Antics, and the dancing sea lions were reused in the 1931 Mickey Mouse short The Castaway.\n\nWhile Wild Waves certainly marks the end of one era for Mickey, it launches another. Wild Waves was the first Mickey short to be directed by Burt Gillett, who would direct more than 30 Mickey shorts over the next several years. The short also marks the final use of the original Mickey Mouse title card until the debut of Get A Horse! In 2013. Don\u2019t be fooled though, as newer releases of the short do use the new title card with Mickey\u2019s face.",

            "content": "The past year for The Walt Disney Company was full of innovations, creative storytelling, and record-breaking successes. As 2025 begins, here\u2019s a look at some of the top moments from across Disney in 2024.\n\nD23 Fan Events Showcase Everything Disney Can Do\n\nD23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event Presented by Visa\u00ae and D23 Brazil \u2014 A Disney Experience showcased everything Disney can do with fan events bigger and more immersive than ever before. The two events \u2014 which took place in Anaheim, California, in August and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in November \u2014 offered thousands of Disney\u2019s most passionate fans a glimpse of the vast array of creativity, talent, and innovation that powers Disney\u2019s brands and businesses. That included major announcements about what\u2019s planned for Disney Parks and resorts, first looks at upcoming films, and a celebration of Disney Legends.\n\nThe Walt Disney Studios Shatters Multiple Records at the Box Office\n\nThe Walt Disney Studios achieved a record-breaking year at the box office, once again showing the importance of the company\u2019s creative storytelling. Pixar Animation Studios\u2019 Inside Out 2 became the highest grossing animated film of all time, Marvel Studios\u2019 Deadpool & Wolverine followed suit with a record of its own, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, and Walt Disney Animation Studios\u2019 Moana 2 was the highest five-day opening of all time and the highest Thanksgiving opening weekend box office ever. Other films such as 20th Century Studios\u2019 Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and Alien: Romulus were also big hits at the box office, while other films such as Searchlight\u2019s A Complete Unknown and A Real Pain garnered rave reviews.\n\nOn Thursday, the Studios announced that it was the No. 1 studio globally bringing in $5.46 billion around the world. That includes $2.23 billion domestically and $3.23 billion internationally. Disney is the first studio to surpass $5 billion worldwide since 2019.\n\nDisney Makes History with Record-Breaking 60 Emmy\u00ae Awards\n\nDisney\u2019s record-breaking year didn\u2019t just take place on the big screen, however. In September, Disney won a record-breaking 60 wins at the 76th Emmy Awards across its content brands, studios, and platforms. That included Disney\u2019s FX receiving 36 awards \u2014 the most for any of the company\u2019s brands or studios and the most in the history of FX. Last year\u2019s most-winning series, Sh\u014dgun, won 19 awards, setting a new Television Academy record for any series in a single year.\n\nABC News Notches No. 1 Viewership While Covering 2024\u2019s Biggest Events\n\nABC News delivered another year of exceptional news coverage, providing audiences with trusted insight and analysis on 2024\u2019s biggest local, national, and global stories. In fact, ABC News\u2019 flagship morning news program, Good Morning America, had the highest total viewership of any morning show during the 2023-2024 season \u2014 for the 12th straight season. Meanwhile, ABC News\u2019 World News Tonight with David Muir was the most-watched evening newscast for the eighth season in a row. World News Tonight also spent 24 of 52 weeks as the No. 1 program of the week in Total Viewers on all of broadcast and cable (with and without sports).\n\nDisney\u2019s Streaming Business Takes a Leap Forward\n\nDisney\u2019s streaming businesses had multiple notable moments last year. Most notably, Disney\u2019s streaming businesses reached profitability and Disney+ celebrated its fifth anniversary in November. Disney also launched Hulu and ESPN+ tiles and hubs on Disney+. In doing so, it created the ultimate streaming destination by giving subscribers to the bundle access to sports, general entertainment, and kids and family programming \u2014 all within a single app.\n\nTiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure Opens at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort\n\nOne of the biggest moments for Disney Experiences last year was the grand opening of Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure at Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World Resort in June and at Disneyland Park at Disneyland Resort in November. Tiana\u2019s Bayou Adventure features dozens of Audio-Animatronics figures, a sensational soundtrack (including music from the film and new compositions), and an exhilarating 50-foot drop.\n\nFantasy Springs at Tokyo DisneySea Comes to Life\n\nAnother big moment in 2024 was Fantasy Springs \u2014 the eighth themed port at Tokyo DisneySea Park \u2014 coming to life on June 6. Fantasy Springs debuted areas inspired by three beloved films and franchises from Walt Disney Animation Studios. That includes Rapunzel\u2019s Forest from 2010\u2019s Tangled, Peter Pan\u2019s Never Land from 1953\u2019s Peter Pan, and Frozen Kingdom from the 2013 blockbuster Frozen. The new port is an entryway for guests into the magical worlds of these films, which include innovative attractions, stunning restaurants, cozy shops, and the Tokyo DisneySea Fantasy Springs Hotel.\n\nDisney Cruise Line Welcomes a New Ship and Announces More to Come\n\nIn November, Disney Cruise Line welcomed its new ship, the Disney Treasure, during a spectacular waterfront christening celebration on the Hudson River in New York City. The dazzling tribute was brought to life by a synchronized showcase of 1,000 drones set to a stirring medley of inspiring Disney songs. Disney Cruise Line also announced in August that four new ships will be joining Disney Cruise Line\u2019s award-winning fleet. With five ships in the current fleet and four others already in development, the additional four ships, which will be delivered between 2027 and 2031, will bring the total size of the fleet to 13.\n\nESPN Celebrates a Record Year\n\nFrom an unprecedented surge in viewership and engagement of women\u2019s sports across Disney platforms to landing several landmark agreements that will shape sports media for years to come, 2024 was an extraordinary year for ESPN. ESPN dominated in viewership across game broadcasts and studio shows and lead the way with innovative storytelling in animated alternative broadcasts. The ESPN brand remains unmatched in sports media, ranking as the No. 1 brand for following sports. Beyond the launch of ESPN on Disney+, ESPN\u2019s commitment to its digital future continued to flourish, with ESPN Digital reaching two thirds of all U.S. adults monthly and maintaining its position as the No.1 sports destination for 32 consecutive months.\n\n\u201cOur creativity and unrelenting service to sports fans will continue in 2025 with the early fall launch of our flagship direct-to-consumer product,\u201d Jimmy Pitaro, Chairman, ESPN, said.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company Looks Ahead with Epic Games and the NBA\n\nWhile 2024 was a banner year, two of the most exciting moments for Disney last year were announcements about things to come.\n\nIn February, it was announced that Disney and Epic Games will collaborate on an all-new games and entertainment universe that will further expand the reach of beloved Disney stories and experiences. In addition to being a world-class games experience and interoperating with Fortnite, the new persistent universe will offer a multitude of opportunities for consumers to play, watch, shop, and engage with content, characters, and stories from Disney.\n\nThen, in July, Disney and ESPN reached a landmark 11-year extension with the NBA and WNBA for media rights that will be in effect from the 2025-26 through 2035-36 NBA seasons and the 2026 through 2036 WNBA seasons. As part of the agreement, ESPN continues its longstanding position as the primary media rights partner of the NBA and the WNBA, as well as the exclusive home of the NBA\u2019s crown jewel event, the NBA Finals.",

But the NWS said they believe conditions will remain \u201cmostly dry\u201d across South Florida.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that some of the coldest temperatures to date could be experienced if this were to fully materialize and follow current model trends,\u201d the agency said.\n\nCold temperatures could last in Florida through Saturday, Jan. 11, and Sunday, Jan. 12, according to The Palm Beach Post. Temperatures in some areas could dip into the teens in northern parts of the state and 20s in central communities.\n\nThe cold temperatures and possibly snow could even cause some parks at Walt Disney World to shut down, according to fan site Inside the Magic.\n\nMeteorologists are reportedly unsure if it will snow in Central Florida, but it hasn't been ruled out. If it did, it would mark the first time since 1977 that snow fell (less than 1 inch) in the Orlando area.\n\nSnow could form during the latter part of the cold snap. A low pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico could muster up enough moisture to help bring snow to the region, according to CW affiliate WJXT.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nBut with a week until the chance for snow, meteorologists warn there is still time for the forecast to change.\n\n\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that these cold fronts will usher in what \"will likely be the coolest in terms of low temperatures that South Florida has experienced thus far this winter to date,\u201d according to the NWS.\n\nSnow is not unheard of in the Panhandle and North Florida. Snow fell in the Panhandle almost exactly a year ago, according to Fox affiliate WOFL.\n\nThe last measurable snow fell in Florida in January 2014, USA Today reported.\n\nSnow has not fallen in South Florida since 1977, when snow was measured there for the first time, according to The Palm Beach Post and WOFL.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into The Walt Disney Co's (NYSE:DIS) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-04, The Walt Disney Co's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $58.08. It's currently trading at a price of $110.82. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -90.81%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe Art of Valuation: Discovering The Walt Disney Co's Intrinsic Value\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. The Walt Disney Co's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $5.03 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.6%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = -4.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 23.9 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 7.79 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 58.08\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $54.08. This valuation indicates that the The Walt Disney Co is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -104.92%.

            "content": "Fresh financials, potential blockbusters, and a major celebratory milestone are just some of the reasons to keep the media giant close this year.\n\nYou might not view Walt Disney (DIS 1.83%) as a holiday play, but the media giant is built for December. It's a conglomerate ripe for this time of year. Its theme parks see a seasonal bounce this time of year, particularly later this month, when schools let out for two weeks.\n\nDisney also always seems to have a blockbuster or two hitting theaters as the calendar year comes to a close. As the majority stakeholder in ESPN, it even sees a boost in audience levels as the college and pro football seasons start to heat up.\n\nAfter a challenging summer, the stock has been rising in the fall. Disney shares have moved higher for three consecutive months, recently hitting seven-month highs. Momentum is on its side, and it had a few events in December that could stretch that winning streak to four months. Let's take a closer look.\n\nFeb. 5\n\nThe first major financial update out of Disney will happen on the morning of Feb. 5, when it reports its fiscal first-quarter results. Expectations are modest, but important.\n\nAnalysts see revenue climbing 5% to nearly $24.7 billion for the three months that ended earlier this week. No one will be surprised by the modest year-over-year increase. Disney has posted single-digit percentage growth in each of the six previous quarterly updates. Profitability is expected to make a bigger jump, rising 18% to hit $1.44 a share.\n\nThe bottom line should grow at a faster clip than the top line, now that Disney+ is profitable. Disney has consistently beaten Wall Street profit targets, so history suggests that net income has a strong chance of posting closer to 20% growth.\n\nThere will naturally be more riding on the report than just the numbers. Investors will want to see if its domestic theme parks business -- where growth has been stagnant over the past year -- is starting to pick up. Disney's streaming operations barely broke even in the first third quarter before taking a strong step into the black in the fourth quarter. The market is hoping that Disney can step on the accelerator and leave the red ink fading in its rearview mirror.\n\nMarch 4\n\nThere is a lot of TV show content coming to Disney's streaming services this year. The sixth season of The Handmaid's Tale arrives on Hulu in the springtime. Marvel's Spider-Man and Black Panther will have new animated series coming to Disney+ in 2025.\n\nOne that I'm particularly looking forward to is Daredevil: Born Again. Weekly episodes will start dropping on March 4.\n\nThe initial Daredevil series launched on Netflix in 2015. Unlike the 2003 Ben Affleck-helmed movie that largely disappointed critics and fans, the Netflix series was widely acclaimed. It scored a 92% approval rating from critics polled on review aggregator hub Rotten Tomatoes. A robust 89% of viewers also would go on to recommend the show.\n\nDisney+ didn't exist at the time. Three years ago, Daredevil and three other Marvel shows that were initially billed as Netflix Originals reverted to Disney ownership. Now Disney has assembled most of the original cast for a reboot, aptly titled Daredevil: Born Again.\n\nMay 16\n\nDisneyland opened in the summer of 1955. Never one to miss a round milestone, Disney is launching a Disneyland 70th anniversary on May 16 at its original California resort. The f\u00eate will run through the summer of 2026.\n\nDisney knows how to milk an anniversary. When Disney World in Florida turned 50 in the fall of 2021, the celebration lasted for 18 months. Commemorative merchandise and new experiences resulted in a jump in both attendance and average revenue per guest. The past year has been a hard act for Disney World to follow, but you have to ride the waves when they swell.\n\nNov. 20\n\nIf you're sensing a little motion in the ocean, it could just be Disney building up its fleet of cruise ships. It took Disney 14 years to send its first four vessels into service. Now it's starting to pick up the pace. The leisure and entertainment behemoth added a fifth ship in 2022, and Disney Treasure made it six when it set sail for its maiden voyage two weeks ago.\n\nThis year, it's launching two new ships. Disney Destiny is slated to start taking passengers on watery escapes on Nov. 20. Just four weeks later, it will be time for Disney Adventure's maiden voyage. Disney Adventure will be the company's largest vessel, with capacity for up to 6,000 guests, 50% more than its largest existing ships.\n\nThe cruise line industry is booming, but this isn't exactly a no-brainer. A Disney sailing is a premium experience. Ramping up supply for big-ticket cruise experience will also require demand to keep up the pace.\n\nDec. 19\n\nDisney dominated the box office in 2024, and its prospects for a repeat performance this year are strong. There are a lot of potential blockbusters hitting a multiplex near you out of Disney's several studios. Marvel has a new Captain America movie coming out on Valentine's Day. A live-action Lilo & Stitch film should fare well when it opens in the seasonally potent Memorial Day weekend. Zootopia 2 hits the silver screen in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nHowever, Disney is saving its biggest theatrical release for last in the 2025 calendar year. Avatar: Fire and Ash will open on Dec. 19. The third installment in James Cameron's franchise that Disney scooped up when the media stock giant acquired 21st Century Fox in 2019 has momentum. The original 2009 film has topped $2.9 billion in worldwide ticket sales over the years, making it the highest-grossing film of all time. The sequel -- Avatar: The Way of Water -- came out in 2022 under Disney's banner. It is now the third-highest grossing movie of all time, and it's the top dog of the post-pandemic era.",

            "content": "The shows around Disney World are incredible, but they often go unnoticed or aren\u2019t as high of a priority as other attractions, such as rides!\n\nI\u2019m majorly guilty of this, and I\u2019m a performer myself! Sometimes I\u2019m moving so fast on my Disney World days I\u2019m afraid sitting down for a half-hour show will mean I dread standing up again or I\u2019ll lose all momentum, but the truth is that I\u2019ve started taking more time to really enjoy the parks and all they have to offer, and the shows are some of my favorite activities! I finally got to see the entirety of the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular a few months ago with Quincy, Sage, and Angie, and Emma and I recently went to Fantasmic! together so I could see it for the first time. However, I got to see a very interesting version of Fantasmic! most guests don\u2019t often see \u2014 it was all in B mode!\n\nWhat is B mode, you may ask? B mode is essentially the backup plan, the plan B, for anything, but especially live shows. If Plan A isn\u2019t working or isn\u2019t safe to do but Plan B is, then B mode it is and the show must go on!\n\nLet me set the scene: Emma and I had just finished having an amazing day in Animal Kingdom with Angie, completing an Everything in Disney World episode, and we both were rushing to Hollywood Studios to see if we could make it in for the 8PM showing of Fantasmic!\n\nThe stars aligned and we made it in just in time, and the show started right as we sat down! For backstory purposes, I had seen Fantasmic! once before, but I had been in middle school and don\u2019t remember anything from that trip, so I was counting this as my first time seeing it. Everything appeared to be progressing as normal \u2014 Emma and I both teared up at the Frozen section, I mouthed along to \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go\u201d from Moana, and then I excitedly was turning to her to say \u201cIs the dragon about to come out?\u201d a few minutes later when the music changed.\n\nBut the dragon DIDN\u2019T come out! That was our first sign that something wasn\u2019t working properly, and was the only sign I actually recognized! However, it was really cool to see the actor playing Maleficent go SO HIGH in the air, and the show went on as normal!\n\nAfter the show, Emma pointed three additional moments out to me that I wouldn\u2019t have noticed otherwise, but she clocked since she\u2019s seen the show so much \u2014 when the Disney characters are all on the ferry boat and doing their final number, they usually have ribbons and do specific choreography. In this case, the characters just waved to guests and didn\u2019t have their ribbons.\n\nAt the end of the show, there were no fireworks, and Emma explained to me that Sorcerer Mickey at the top of the stage didn\u2019t drop as quickly as he normally does, also resulting in \u201cregular\u201d Mickey not popping up as fast down at the bottom. I will admit that because there weren\u2019t any fireworks at the end, it didn\u2019t pack the same emotional punch as I was expecting, but I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the show again and hopefully seeing it in its full working capacity! Want to see Emma and I talk more about the show and our thoughts? Check out the AllEars YouTube episode below!\n\nI feel like I\u2019m always experiencing things in Disney World for the first time, and I write about all of them here, so stay tuned to AllEars for all the latest Disney World news!\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite show in Disney World?

Parker, who is departing the Disney board on January 2 after nine years of service.\n\nGorman was executive chairman of Morgan Stanley and stepped down from that role on December 31, 2024. He is currently chair of the Disney Board\u2019s Succession Planning Committee, which is working to identify and prepare the next chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company.\n\n\u201cJames Gorman is an esteemed leader who has become an invaluable voice on the Disney Board since joining earlier this year, and I am extremely pleased that he has agreed to assume the role of Chairman upon my departure. Drawing on his vast experience, James is expertly guiding the extensive search process for a new CEO, which remains a top priority for the board,\u201d said Parker, who is executive chairman of NIKE, Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs I prepare to leave the board to focus on other areas of my work, I am proud of Disney\u2019s renewed position of strength and excited for the company\u2019s future, and I want to thank my fellow directors, Bob Iger and his exemplary management team for their continued strong leadership and dedication.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Disney Board has benefited tremendously from James Gorman\u2019s expertise and guidance, and we are lucky to have him as our next Chairman \u2013 particularly as the Board continues to move forward with the succession process,\u201d said Iger. \u201cI\u2019m extremely grateful to Mark Parker for his many years of Board service and leadership, which have been so valuable to this company and its shareholders, and to me as CEO.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as Disney\u2019s Chairman at this important moment in the company\u2019s history,\u201d said Gorman. \u201cIn the short time I have had the opportunity to work with Mark, I have come to appreciate and deeply respect his authentic leadership, humility and intelligence. I know all directors join me in saying we have been honored to serve with him as the Chairman of the Board.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA critical priority before us is to appoint a new CEO, which we now expect to announce in early 2026. This timing reflects the progress the Succession Planning Committee and the board are making, and will allow ample time for a successful transition before the conclusion of Bob Iger\u2019s contract in December 2026,\u201d said Gorman.\n\nInformation for this article was sourced from a Walt Disney Company press release.",

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Walt Disney's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n\nThe top 25 shareholders own 41% of the company\n\nalong with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\n\nEvery investor in The Walt Disney Company ( ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Walt Disney.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWalt Disney already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Walt Disney's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walt Disney. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.6%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Walt Disney\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Walt Disney Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$72m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Walt Disney. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

If you\u2019re heading to the parks in February, you need to know that there are MULTIPLE rides that will be closed the entire month!\n\nMagic Kingdom\n\nThree attractions will be closed for the entirety of February. The first of which is Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which closes on January 6th and will remain closed for at least a year. We don\u2019t have a reopening date, and likely won\u2019t have one for a while, but we\u2019ll keep you updated!\n\nAstro Orbiter also closes on January 13th and won\u2019t be reopening for a few months. Again, there\u2019s no reopening date, but we do foresee this one opening earlier than Big Thunder Mountain Railroad!\n\nFinally, Hall of Presidents closes on January 20th and will be reopening in a few months. This closure happens every 4 years after U.S. elections take place, and the attraction always reopens to properly reflect the new (or returning) President.\n\nEPCOT\n\nTwo attractions will be closed in EPCOT in February \u2014 the first is Test Track, which closed in 2023 to make way for the new version of the ride that will be debuting this summer!\n\nGran Fiesta Tour will also be closed for the entire month of February for refurbishment. The closure begins on January 6th and continues through March 15th, when the ride will reopen.\n\nThat reopening timeline could change at any time though, so we\u2019ll keep our eyes peeled!\n\nAnimal Kingdom\n\nOver in Animal Kingdom, Kali River Rapids will be closed for its annual refurbishment during the winter months from January 6th through March 2025.

            "content": "On a cool November evening in New York City, a swarm of hundreds of drones gracefully buzzed over the Hudson River, taking shape above a darkened ship floating in the water.\n\nWhat followed was a veritable procession of Walt Disney Co. intellectual property, paired with music from Disney classics. The drones formed one character or scene after another, including the genie from Aladdin, Madame Leota from The Haunted Mansion, and Dante from Coco.\n\nFinally, as Moana\u2019s \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go\u201d played over the sound system, the drones formed the Heart of Te Fiti over the ship, and the vessel\u2019s lights flickered on. In a grand finale, the drones formed a popping champagne bottle, and the voice of Disney CEO Bob Iger officially christened the Disney Treasure, the newest cruise ship in the Disney Cruise Line fleet.\n\nJust a few minutes before the drones rose above the water, Iger himself addressed a crowd of invited guests at an event space inside the Chelsea Piers athletic complex on Manhattan\u2019s west side, overlooking the Disney Treasure floating a few hundred feet away in the Hudson.\n\nJoined on stage by Disney Experiences chairman Josh D\u2019Amaro and Mickey and Minnie Mouse in full ship captain garb (\u201cI feel like I\u2019m being upstaged here,\u201d Iger quipped as the characters stepped offstage to applause), the Disney CEO touted the Treasure as \u201ca shining example of everything our fans love about Disney.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the launch of the Disney Cruise Line in 1998 our ships have become brand ambassadors, that bring our world-class storytelling and the immersive nature of our theme parks to new audiences and new places around the world,\u201d Iger said.\n\nIndeed, there is no entertainment company that has had more success exploiting its IP in so many ways, and in so many places, as The Walt Disney Co. The films lead to streaming series which become theme park rides and attractions which can turn into stage shows and ice shows, with the characters making appearances around the globe.\n\nThe Disney Treasure, which departed on its maiden voyage Dec. 21, is in many ways a textbook example. The ship features characters and IP everywhere you turn.\n\nSome are obvious, like an oversized bronze stature of Aladdin and Jasmine that greet you in the Grand Hall when you first board the ship, or when the ships\u2019 horns blare classic Disney tunes, and others are more subtle, like a small statue of Hei Hei, the chicken featured in Moana, who stands on the side of the bar at his namesake Hei Hei Cafe.\n\nThere are restaurants and bars that are immersive, like a Coco-themed dining venue that makes guests feel as though they are walking through the village of Santa Cecilia from the Pixar film, with a stage front and center so a live musical show can take place during the meal. There is a bar based on the Disneyland and Disney World attraction The Haunted Mansion that makes guests feel like they stepped off their \u201cDoom Buggy\u201d and into the world of the ride itself.\n\nAnd there are venues that are more abstract, like a loosely Aristocats-themed piano bar called The Scat Cat Lounge, or the Jungle Cruise-themed Skipper Society, where references to the classic ride are visible everywhere you look in subtle ways.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to make you feel like we had brought a version of those attractions on board, and for you to experience them there in a way that you haven\u2019t before,\u201d says Jason Roberts, senior producer for Disney Imagineering, speaking in the Sarabi Lounge, a venue with subtle nods to the animated classic The Lion King.\n\nWhile Disney Cruise Line has long developed venues based on Disney films and other IP, the Treasure looked to Disney\u2019s theme parks for inspiration.\n\n\u201cAs an imagineer that\u2019s coming from the division that developed these theme park attractions, I think the most important thing was to be authentic to those attractions,\u201d Roberts says, listing off all the details in the Haunted Mansion Parlor, which include ghostly apparitions in the mirror above the bar, portraits on the wall that change over time, and a fish tank where the swimming fish are skeletons. \u201cIt\u2019s so authentic down to the details. It\u2019s the wallpaper, it\u2019s those distinctive chair designs, those bat sconces on the wall. We want you to feel like you\u2019re in The Haunted Mansion. We want you to be part of that story. We wanted to immerse you and envelop you there.\u201d\n\nThe Haunted Mansion Parlor aboard the Disney Treasure. Kent Phillips\n\nOr the Skipper Society, which doesn\u2019t quite make you feel like you are on The Jungle Cruise itself, but perhaps hanging out at the pub where all those skippers go after their shift ends to trade quips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite as immersive, but all of the hints are all around you, those corny, terrible jokes, you see them printed on the wall,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cThe canopy above the bar that makes it feel like that\u2019s one of the boats from Jungle Cruise. That\u2019s what we really wanted to convey. We wanted you to feel like the attraction was right there and you were a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe same science applies to the entertainment experiences on the ship. Disney, after all, is in the entertainment business, and the Disney Treasure, like all Disney cruises, has no shortage of programming.\n\nDisney is debuting a new Broadway-style stage show on the Treasure, The Tale of Moana, the first ever stage adaptation of the animated film. And it has a pair of comedic actors, Coriander and Sage, who host Indiana Jones-themed trivia contests, and perform intimate renditions of films like Encanto in the Grand Hall in moments meant to surprise and delight guests.\n\nThere are movies, of course, playing in two theaters on board and on a jumbo-sized screen above the pool deck, and there are intimate moments of entertainment, like when Chewbacca, Spider Man or Belle surprise children in the kids club with missions or adventures.\n\nJenny Weinbloom, the VP of live entertainment for Disney Signature Experiences, says that the company uses a few different lenses to figure out what IP it can and should exploit when developing shows for the cruise ships.\n\n\u201cWe certainly are thinking about, what do our guests love? What stories are they connecting with and want to spend more time with?\u201d Weinbloom says. \u201cWhat are the franchises that the company is continuing to invest in long term, and that we anticipate future generations will have relationship with? Because if you think about the shows on these ships, they have a long life. They run for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s only one angle we look at it through. I\u2019d say it\u2019s actually the secondary angle. The primary is what sings? What\u2019s going to make a great musical?\u201d she adds. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just great songs that make a great musical. It\u2019s actually very much about the structure of the film.\u201d\n\nMoana, she notes, checked all the boxes.\n\nThe Tale of Moana on the Disney Treasure.\n\nDisney Experiences is in many ways the secret sauce for the company, the place where IP meets the real world, and where emotional memories are formed by fans. The company is pouring $60 billion into the division over the next decade, with billions earmarked for the cruise business specifically.\n\nBut Disney Cruise Lines is a particularly unique business. Other entertainment companies have IP in theme parks, but no other company can bring its IP around the world via ship.\n\nAt the Disney Treasure Christening in New York Nov. 19, D\u2019Amaro touted \u201cthe power of Disney storytelling\u201d when it comes to its cruise business, calling out Disney Imagineering chief creative officer Bruce Vaughn, who was in attendance. The Imagineers, of course, take Disney IP and create ways for fans to immerse themselves in it.\n\nAnd he noted the \u201cunprecedented era of growth for Disney Experiences,\u201d including the fact that Disney Cruise Line plans to double its fleet of ships by 2031. In fact, it has two more set to launch in 2025: The Disney Destiny, which will cruise from Florida, and the Disney Adventure, which will operate from a home port in Singapore.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of room to showcase IP.\n\nDoubling the fleet underscores the financial potential for the division. Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne wrote that the cruise division could have $10 billion in revenue and $3 billion in EBITDA by 2031. \u201cFor context, the cruise business exiting this decade could be larger in EBITDA than ESPN in 2024,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRoberts says that for every ship, the Imagineers look at the \u201crich history of storytelling at Disney\u201d to discover some theme that serves as connective tissue, something that binds the disparate pieces of IP together in a way that makes vacationers feel like they are truly escaping.\n\nFor the Disney Treasure, that theme is adventure.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about all of the animated films, they all have a bit of adventure to them, no matter what the story is, whether it\u2019s Mulan or whether it\u2019s Miguel in Coco, they\u2019re all going on an adventure of some kind,\u201d Roberts says.\n\nThat applies to Disney\u2019s other IP as well, like a Marvel-themed restaurant that includes a mission to help Groot, or a sports bar called The Periscope Pub based on the classic Disneyland attraction 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, complete with shadowy images of sharks swimming above visitors as they sip their beers and watch the game. Soon it will even apply to non-Disney IP, with the popular children\u2019s show Bluey set to bring it\u2019s characters to Disney cruises originating from Australia and New Zealand in January.\n\nIt makes for a unique proposition. Marvel movies play around the world, of course, but Disney only has theme parks in a few locations. What Disney is betting that Disney Cruise Line can do is bring some of that magic to home ports far away from parks, be it Singapore, Australia, the U.K. or Vancouver, Canada.\n\nThe Disney Treasure is only one vessel, but it is emblematic of that larger goal that the company is pursuing over the next few years. Live experiences based on IP might be commonplace, but only Disney is doubling down on bringing it by sea to its fans around the world.\n\nStar Wars: Cargo Bay at Disney\u2019s Oceaneer Club on the Disney Treasure Kent Phillips\n\nAvengers room onboard the Disney Treasure Oceaneers Club Alex Weprin",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nBetween figuring out Lightning Lanes and how to cram all the rides and meals the family wants into a single trip, planning a Disney World vacation is complicated enough \u2014 let alone if you\u2019re trying to do Disney on a budget.\n\nAn entire cottage industry of \u201cDisney hacks\u201d has popped up on social media in recent years, with influencers explaining how to navigate the complex web of deals and methods you can employ to save money on your Disney trip. You can even take online classes in Disney vacations, if you want.\n\nBut Disney, long criticized for its high-priced tickets, is making a concerted effort to add simplicity to its park offerings so guests can figure out how to travel on a budget without needing a doctorate in Disney World.\n\nFor example, Disney on Monday announced free dining plans for three-night Walt Disney World guests who buy a Park Hopper ticket and arrive between May 27 and June 26 or July 7 through August 6. Dining plans get ticketholders a couple of meals, a snack and a refillable mug for each night of their stay \u2014 i.e. one less thing to plan and worry about. They\u2019re typically offered as an add-on purchase.\n\nDisney World previously announced other money-saving perks, including complimentary parking at resorts (it used to charge, much to the annoyance of guests). And Disney has doubled down on its app experience, which gives visitors a better sense of how long they should expect to wait in the park\u2019s notoriously long lines.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve made a lot of enhancements, and that\u2019s helped us,\u201d said Greg Antonelle, owner of MickeyTravels, an authorized Disney vacation planner. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily need to be a Disney expert to figure some of these things out. They\u2019ve tried to make the in-park experience straightforward for the guest.\u201d\n\nDisney made other guest-friendly improvements in 2024.\n\nThe parks relaxed reservation requirements and brought back Park Hopper access for guests who want to go to multiple theme parks in a single day. Disney let guests modify dining reservations up to two hours in advance; previously, visitors were locked in a day before the reservation was set. And guests can now make their Lightning Lane plans before the day of their visit, so they\u2019re not futzing with their apps while they\u2019re in the park.\n\nAnd the parks are working to clarify for guests when they can save money.\n\nDisney World announced it will offer up to 25% off on rooms early next year or $200 off per night for three-night guests who book a resort hotel stay. Disneyland has a $50 kids ticket offer for children up to 9 years old between January 7 and March 20. And both parks are offering deals for local residents and military members and veterans, too.\n\nAn advantage of going during off-peak times: You might not need to purchase an expensive Lighting Lane pass for your favorite rides. During peak hours, they\u2019re necessities if you don\u2019t want to wait in a two- to three-hour line, but those lines can shrink to just 30 to 45 minutes during off-peak hours.\n\nEmphasizing value over price\n\nCan you do a Disney trip for $25,000? You bet. And the company gets raked over the coals for it. Disney raising ticket prices has become a symbol of corporate greed. Both Disney World (Florida) and Disneyland (California) tickets can cost more than $100 per person per day.\n\nThe deals and enhanced visibility into how customers can save money could give some turned-off families reason to give Disney World or Disneyland a second look. And Disney would welcome that. The company announced in its latest financial report that foot traffic at US parks stalled out in recent quarters. Some inflation-weary travelers are looking to book more exotic getaways than a theme park if they\u2019re going to be spending thousands of dollars on a family vacation.\n\nSo Disney, like many other brands that have battled inflation, is emphasizing value, Antonelle noted.\n\n\u201cWe have some clients who stay at the club level at the Grand Floridian luxury resort for two weeks. And we have guests who stay at a value resort \u2014 and those people have just as much fun and make as many memories,\u201d Antonelle said. \u201cDisney gets some flak for their pricing, but there\u2019s a lot of value you can get at Disney if you go at the right time.\u201d\n\nDisney on a budget comes with some sacrifices: You won\u2019t be able to go during peak vacation hours. You might have to take your children out of school for a few days during the week. January to March and September to November are the cheapest times to go, according to Jaimie Michaels, editor at Disney travel planning company MagicGuides.\n\nBut just like there are a zillion options and price points when buying a car and you need to do some research to make sure you\u2019re buying the right thing, a Disney vacation can be a similarly challenging purchase. Disney isn\u2019t an impulse buy. Options and perks are constantly changing, and it\u2019s best to come prepared.\n\nBut Disney has heard the gripes, and it has reduced the amount of homework you need to do to go on a budget. And if you do, you can get a lot of bang for your buck.\n\n\u201cYou can go to a sporting event or Taylor Swift concert and spend a lot of money for two hours,\u201d Antonelle said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at Disney you can be in the park for 15 hours \u2014 and in that 15 hours, you can see a concert, play minigolf, you can see a parade and fireworks. \u2026 People just look at price, but not the value.\u201d",

One person was killed in Alvin, and officials say at least four others were hurt.\n\nWhile a tornado caused damage at the school, no one was hurt.\n\nIn an emergency board meeting on Monday morning, officials approved emergency spending for repairs to Walt Disney Elementary. In addition, funds will be needed to prepare an alternate location for students.\n\n\"We're in the process of working with transportation and families that we will bus them to another site,\" superintendent Carol Nelson explained. \"An open school that we are currently using for training and things of that nature. We have to set it up as a whole new elementary school. That's what we're working on now.\"\n\nThe plan is to move students and staff to the former Alvin Elementary School at 1910 Rosharon Road. The facility has been closed as a school since 2023. Since then it's been used for storage and other district needs.\n\nNew bus routes will need to be scheduled. The temporary school is a 10-minute drive from the damaged campus.\n\nSkyEye flew over the storm-ravaged areas and captured video of severe damage.\n\nA tornado in Montgomery County had peak winds of 145 miles per hour, while a tornado in Brazoria County was on the ground for eight miles and had winds between 115 and 135 miles per hour.\n\nAdministrators surveyed the damage at Walt Disney Elementary School on Sunday. The future of the campus is still up in the air as damage assessments continue. There's been no dollar estimate yet or determination for repairs.\n\nNelson said if you're interested in donating to help teachers, you can contact adminservices@alvinisd.net.\n\nOne place helping is Corey's Kitchen in Alvin. The owner's nieces and nephews attend the school.\n\nOn Tuesday, the community can drop off supplies from 2 p.m. until 8 p.m. On Monday, customers discovered the Walt Disney Elementary special.\n\n\"$2 from each sale went to help the impacted teachers. This is our community,\" owner Corey Scopel said. \"We're a small town, and it's very important that we come together and help one another out.\"\n\nRELATED: Damage assessment begins in Brazoria County after deadly tornado passed through, officials said\n\nBrazoria County was left storm-ravaged after a strong storm produced a deadly tornado.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the tornado that struck the school on Saturday was an EF-2.\n\nSEE ALSO: 5 confirmed tornadoes that hit Waller, Montgomery, Brazoria, Galveston and Chambers Co., NWS says\n\nThe district said many teachers lost valuable materials, some of which they paid for out-of-pocket. To help combat the losses, the Alvin ISD Education Foundation is taking donations online.\n\nAlvin ISD said the school is in urgent need of general school and teacher supplies, as well as picture books.\n\nIf you would like to donate in person, staff will collect donations now through Thursday at the former Alvin Primary School site, at 2200 Westpark Drive, Alvin, TX 77511.\n\nDonations will be collected from 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, and from 8 a.m.-12 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nRELATED: Surviving spouse recounts horror of Alvin tornado that killed her wife, 47-year-old, Jamie Brown",

            "content": "I had enough airline miles for two round-trip first-class tickets from Los Angeles to Orlando.\n\nWe enjoyed the experiences and our time together and reconnected as a couple.\n\nThere would be no penny-pinching on this trip, unlike our first as parents.\n\nBeing from Southern California, many would ask why I'd want to spend the money to go to Walt Disney World in Florida when I had Disneyland in my backyard. I would say that if you ask that question, you've never been there. It is a magical world unto itself.\n\nOur first trip was in 1987, and my wife and I made annual trips until 1993 when we found out we were going to be parents.\n\nAnyone with kids knows that life changes. We waited until our son was old enough and returned as a family in 1998. It was even more magical with children. By the time he was 8, we gave him a walkie-talkie and let him run around the hotel as long as he checked in with us.\n\nAt the time, I never thought that one day, we would return without children.\n\nMy son didn't want to go when he was a teenager\n\nLife is all about change, especially with kids. The next two decades saw many family trips to the magical world in Florida. When the economy changed in 2007, we switched to driving across the Western US with our camping trailer, but always as a family. Being a dad wasn't just something I did; it was who I was.\n\nBut life changes; children don't stay children forever. As a teen, it was no longer cool for my son to go on trips with Mom and Dad. Then, the inevitable happened: high school graduation, college, and the Army. We had officially become empty-nesters.\n\nBy 2017, our financial situation had improved, and I was once again working as an executive. I felt secure and decided it was time to reward ourselves. It would be our first trip to Disney World without kids in decades, and it felt weird. We had originally planned for September, but Hurricane Irma had other plans. We rescheduled for February of 2018. We'd never gone in Spring; we'd always gone in August to close out the summer before school started.\n\nWe hit all the parks when we went by ourselves\n\nI worked late the night before answering final emails. Then I clicked \"save\" on my out-of-office message. I was officially on vacation. I had years of airline miles accumulated and had enough for two first-class round-trip tickets.\n\nWe headed first to Universal Studios and a two-night stay at the Royal Pacific Resort Hotel. We did all the parks and all the Harry Potter attractions. We even got a Butter Beer. But we'd come to Florida for another reason.\n\nOn our third day, we drove to Disney's Wilderness Lodge. We've stayed at a half dozen resorts on the property over the years, but this is our favorite. The architecture is reminiscent of the great national park lodges. A pine forest surrounds it and overlooks Bay Lake. There is even a geyser (artificial) that erupts regularly. Our room overlooked the lake, pool, and geyser. Every nigh,t we watched the Bay Lake Electrical Water Pageant from our balcony.\n\nThe trip brought back so many memories\n\nBeing at Disney World just as a couple brought back a lot of memories. We were a little older, but it was as if no time had passed at all since that first trip as a young couple all those years ago, except that I had less hair. One of my favorite photos of all time is from this trip. It's a selfie of us at the Universal Hotel, me in my Disney polo shirt, her auburn hair gently resting on her bare shoulders.\n\nHolding hands, we walked to the Magic Kingdom. For the next six days, we hopped from one park to the next. Exploring all the changes to the resort since our last trip. Enjoying all the rides, shows, attractions, and dining experiences. EPCOT was having its International Flower & Garden Festival. The park was filled with beautiful floral displays and unique food carts in every land. We rented bikes at the Fort Wilderness Campground and had a picnic lunch by the lake. Walked around Disney Springs and toured the hotels and the campground.\n\nIt was a perfect trip, but the one thing that I would do differently next time is not have a rental car. Though the Alamo rental was only $331 for the eight days, it was another $25 per day for parking at the hotel. And the traffic was so bad on the resort that we ended up just using the resort transit. The hotel cost for 8 days was $3,697. We also spent another $2,080 on taxes, dining, and souvenirs on our Disney gift card from our Chase Disney Rewards Visa.\n\nThough I did have to take a couple of work calls and was \"allowed\" one hour per day to catch up on emails, it was one of the first vacations in a long time where I felt relaxed and refreshed. We didn't have an itinerary, no schedule to keep. We enjoyed the experiences and our time together and reconnected as a couple.",

            "content": "I loved going to Disney World as a kid, particularly the freedom of the parks.\n\nI now bring my kids, but we feel bogged down by apps, crowds, and restrictions.\n\nMy kids don't know what they're missing, but the parks have changed so much for me.\n\nVisiting Disney World was an annual experience of my youth. For decades, my family would spend a long October weekend at the Fort Wilderness camping resort. We'd run around the parks and skip through the numerous resorts and restaurants sprinkled throughout the Lake Buena Vista campus.\n\nThe Disney parks somehow felt futuristic and cutting-edge while also being nostalgic and magical. The trips made such an impression that I still find myself every September doing house chores with the animated \"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" playing in the background or watching YouTube videos of park workers setting up the fall decorations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when my wife and I started taking our boys to the parks, I fell into the nostalgia trap of hoping their experiences would be just like mine. Time and economics had other plans.\n\nA Disney trip requires too much planning now\n\nI never appreciated the high level of planning it takes to visit a theme park until I became a parent. Ride line length and bad weather were my only concerns as a kid \u2014 with some minor concerns about food.\n\nBut as a parent, I find myself overwhelmed by the sheer number of pre-visit requirements.\n\nWhen you take pride in your theme-park survival knowledge, nothing will humble you faster than trying to navigate the do's and don'ts of visiting a Disney park in the 21st century. Visiting a park these days requires weeks of planning, constant communication with everyone traveling in your group, and downloading phone apps just to enjoy certain parts of the park.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther complications include things like Lightning Lane passes, blackout dates, rope drops, ride reservations, and premium annual passes \u2014 all things I never had to think about that have since become standard operating procedures for park visits.\n\nMy favorite part of visiting the Magic Kingdom used to be seeing the castle once I got through the front gate. Now, it's the bar stool at the resort because it doesn't require a reservation (yet).\n\nI wish my kids get to be more free at the parks as I was\n\nIn addition to the annual October visits, I frequently visited the parks through school field trips or group events like Grad Nite. I have memories of racing through the parks with my friends, sprinting from ride to attraction with minimal crowds to slow us down, feeling like those feral kids from \"Pinocchio\" before they got turned into donkeys.\n\nThe sheer volume of the Disney park crowds these days makes that notion impossible. Our boys have fewer opportunities to behave like wild unaccompanied minors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis reality doesn't bother me too much, especially since I get the feeling park security would be less tolerant of unaccompanied minors than when I was a kid.\n\nThankfully, my kids don't care\n\nOf course, none of these differences mean anything to my kids. I have no idea how they really feel about visiting the parks, but I know they enjoy it, and I'm getting better at letting them have their own life experiences without comparing them to mine.\n\nThat's fine because those comparisons didn't matter to me as a kid, either. Historians refer to the 1970s and 1980s as Disney's Dark Age, the years when the company produced some of its darkest films and the parks were not the IP-heavy juggernauts of today. But that didn't matter to a late-stage Generation X kid who watched \"Robin Hood\" and \"Winnie the Pooh\" until the VCR ate the tapes.\n\nVisiting the parks felt like stepping into a pocket dimension where all the lands and characters showcased by Disney could be seen and touched. The Disney I experienced was the correct Disney, just as the Disney my boys currently experience is also the correct Disney.\n\nPlus, I can feel them rolling their eyes whenever we talk about how much the parks have changed since we were kids.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

As always, we remind our readers that Walt Disney World Resort theme park tickets are rarely offered at deep discounts unless you are a resident of Florida or eligible for U.S. Military Personnel benefits. Historically, non-Florida residents tend to benefit the most by purchasing tickets in advance (and, of course, being mindful of the rules relevant to those tickets). Don\u2019t get scammed! Never buy tickets from an unofficial or secondary outlet, such as through eBay or Craigslist. Never rent or purchase tickets from people approaching you outside Disney property stating they have remaining days or leftover tickets. This practice is against the terms of use for Walt Disney World Theme Park admissions, and may result in denial of entry. There is no way to determine if these tickets are valid until you try to use them to enter the parks.",
