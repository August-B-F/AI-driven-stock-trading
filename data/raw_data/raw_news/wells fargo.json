Fox - Seattle\n\nWells Fargo will lay employees at its Jordan Creek Campus in West Des Moines effective May 18.\n\nThis is the second round of layoffs at the location this month.\n\nWells Fargo has been reducing its workforce in recent years, with 1,078 layoffs since April 2022.\n\nThe bank attributed the layoffs to the need to 'align with market conditions and the needs of our businesses.'\n\nFor the second time this month, Wells Fargo has announced layoffs at its Jordan Creek Campus in West Des Moines, this time for 34 employees effective May 18, according to the state\u2019s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, website.\n\nEarlier in March, Wells Fargo announced the layoff of 33 employees effective April 4.\n\nThe fourth-largest bank in the United States with assets of $1.7 trillion, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, once the largest employer in the Des Moines metro, has been paring back its workforce in recent years. The latest announcement brings the total workforce reductions to 1,078 since April 2022, according to the WARN website.\n\nThe company on Wednesday issued its standard response to a request for comment, saying its leaders \u201cregularly review and adjust staffing levels to align with market conditions and the needs of our businesses.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo also has consistently stated that it works to find opportunities for affected employees in other parts of the company and provides assistance such as severance pay and career counseling if jobs are not available.\n\nThe Wells Fargo website on Wednesday listed 37 job openings in Des Moines and West Des Moines.\n\nThe latest Des Moines metro layoff notices did not indicate in which divisions Wells Fargo was reducing jobs, and the company has declined to specify when asked in past layoffs. The bank\u2019s home mortgage division, heavily concentrated in the Des Moines metro, has throttled back amid higher interest rates and lower demand.\n\nWells Fargo's Des Moines metro employment peaked 14,500 in 2017, but it has since fallen to what the Greater Des Moines Partnership says is \u201cmore than 11,000.\u201d That's eclipsed by the 12,000-plus of the Hy-Vee supermarket chain, which has its headquarters in West Des Moines.\n\nKevin Baskins covers jobs and the economy for the Des Moines Register.

            "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Only half the original 330 qualifiers remain alive in the 2025 DI men's NCAA wrestling tournament. Here are the biggest storylines from the first day of matches here in Philadelphia:\n\n1. Penn State went 20-for-20\n\nThe Nittany Lions have yet to lose a match thus far at the NCAA tournament. All 20 of their athletes advance to the quarterfinals, led by No. 1 Luke Lilledahl at 125 pounds with two tech falls, No. 1 Tyler Kasak at 157 pounds with a fall and a decision, No. 1 Mitchell Mesenbrink at 165 pounds who has two tech falls and No. 1 Carter Starocci at 184 pounds with his two tech falls. Penn State leads the team race with 39 points, followed by Nebraska at 28, Oklahoma State at 27 and a three-way tie for fourth between Iowa, Minnesota and Ohio State who all have 18 points\n\n2. Two returning national champs go down + while several All-Americans knocked out\n\nArizona State's Richard Figueroa and Andrew Alirez of Northern Colorado, both former NCAA champs from 2024 and 2023 respectively, dropped their second-round matches and will now work to battle back for third from the consolation bracket. Figueroa's loss came first in dramatic fashion at 125 pounds against Dean Peterson of Rutgers. Peterson pinned Figueroa in the second period and celebrated in the same style that Figueroa's used after he won the bracket last season. Peterson will now have No. 4 Vincent Robinson of NC State in his quarterfinal with All-American honors on the line.\n\nNCAA WRESTLING TOURNAMENT: UPDATED BRACKETS | UPDATED TEAM SCORES\n\nAndrew Alirez, on the other hand, lost at 141 pounds to Jacob Frost of Iowa State who came into this tournament with a 23-7 record to Alirez' 17-2. The match wasn't particularly close either, as Frost ran away with it 6-1. Frost will now face No. 1 Brock Hardy in the quarterfinals as he too chases his first All-American honors.\n\nOutside of the returning champs losing, a number of other All-Americans finished 0-2 on the night. NC State's Kai Orine dropped his consolation bout to Rutgers' All-American Dylan Shawver in a battle of former placewinners in sudden victory. This match had all the drama, but, in the end, the Scarlet Knight prevailed, and he'll have Maryland's No. 9 Braxton Brown next.\n\nVirginia Tech's Sam Latona also ended his tournament and his career on Thursday night after losing to Danny Pucino of Illinois 12-8. Pucino continues his run for his first All-American honors this morning against Dylan Cedeno of Virginia.\n\nIowa's returning NCAA finalist Jacori Teemer finished his college wrestling career as well in the consolations after the Hawkeye lost 8-5 to Noah Castillo of Chattanooga. These results matter for the team race, but Iowa and Virginia Tech are not the only teams with a star who took a second loss. Ohio State's Carson Kharchla also lost Thursday night to Nebraka's Lenny Pinto in a high-pressure overtime result 12-7. The Buckeyes can make up some of these points from their surprise quarterfinalist Seth Shumate.\n\nLAST YEAR'S PLACEWINNERS: The complete list of the 2024 All-Americans\n\nRutgers is another team with high highs and low lows from Thursday as, despite the wins from Shawver and Peterson, the Scarlet Knights still lost a pointscorer when All-American Jackson Turley dropped to Danny Braunagel of Illinois 18-8 to end his tournament.\n\nLastly, Minnesota All-American and former Big Ten champion Isaiah Salazar dropped his second match of the tournament to Wyatt Voelker of Northern Iowa to wrap up his season.\n\n3. Lenny Wolak and Gabe Sollars headline the upsets as the two lowest-ranked seeds in the quarterfinals\n\nUpsets define the NCAA tournament every year, and this year is no different. None of the ten weight classes in this tournament have gone chalk thus far, but the two biggest upsets, seeds wise, on the path to the quarterfinals, came at the hands of No. 24 Virginia Tech's Lennox Wolak and No. 24 Indiana's Gabe Sollars at 174 pounds and 197 pounds. Wolak, an All-American for Columbia last year, posted a 15-10 regular season record, but he's on fire here in March. The Hokie grad student beat No. 9 Carson Kharchla in the first round 4-2 and then topped Army's Dalton Harkin in sudden victory in the second round. He'll face No. 1 Keegan O'Toole in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe inside trip strikes again this time for a trip to the quarterfinals!#Hokies \ud83e\udd83 pic.twitter.com/fpL4hlEiI6 \u2014 Virginia Tech Wrestling (@HokiesWrestling) March 21, 2025\n\nSollars was perhaps an even bigger surprise, given that he has not previously earned All-American honors and had to beat Big Ten semifinalist Zac Braunagel and No. 25 Patrick Brophy of the Citadel \u2014 who upset No. 8 Luke Surber in the first round \u2014 to advance to the quarterfinals. He'll now have a shot against No. 1 Jacob Cardenas of Michigan. He's 0-1 against Cardenas, but he held the Michigan Man to an 8-4 decision on their last bout. If he loses, he'll drop into the Blood Round where he'll face whoever emerges from the consolation quad that includes No. 11 Luke Stout of Princeton, No. 19 Andy Smith of Virginia Tech, No. 20 Camden McDanel of Nebraska and No. 21 Levi Hopkins of Campbell.\n\n4. Mac Stout wins the battle of the brothers\n\nPittsburgh's Mac Stout won the most interesting and unique match of the night on Thursday night when he took down his brother, Luke Stout of Princeton to advance to the quarterfinals. Mac Stout's lone takedown sealed the deal for the Panther in what was a historic moment for Division I college wrestling.\n\nBROTHER VS. BROTHER: Here's how the now-famous Stout matchup went down\n\n4. Five pins so far in the championship bracket at 157 pounds\n\nThe first two rounds of the championship bracket produced 28 pins with five of them coming at 157 pounds. Penn State's Tyler Kasak headlines the weight and picked up a first period fall against his first round opponent Landen Johnson of Northern Illinois.\n\nPenn's No. 14 Jude Swisher then pinned his first-round opponent No. 19 Cobe Siebrecht of South Dakota State only to have the favor returned against him the second round when No. 3 Antrell Taylor of Nebraska put the Quaker on his back in the first period.\n\nA man on a mission \ud83d\ude24\n\n\n\nTrelly with the first-period PIN to advance to the quarterfinals. pic.twitter.com/PhW9n8Tv3p \u2014 Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling) March 21, 2025\n\nMichigan's No. 23 Chase Saldate had a similar roller coaster experience with falls, beating Maryland's No. 10 Ethen Miller by pin in the first round before losing to No. 7 Vinny Zerban of Northern Colorado 5-1 after Zerban also pinned his first round opponent, No. 26 Blake Saito of Brown.\n\nThree athletes \u2014 No. 2 Wyatt Hendrickson at 285 pounds and No. 8 Jaxon Smith at 184 pounds and No. 12 Silas Allred\u2014 have pinned both of their opponents so far. If Allred and Smith both pull off upsets, they could meet in the semifinals. If they both lose but then win their Blood Round match, they could meet in the consolation medal rounds.\n\nEvery weight has at least one fall thus far across both the championship and consolation brackets.",

            "content": "It might be of some concern to shareholders to see the Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) share price down 10% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 135% in that time. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now.\n\nSince it's been a strong week for Wells Fargo shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Wells Fargo achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.7% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 19% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nNYSE:WFC Earnings Per Share Growth March 21st 2025\n\nWe know that Wells Fargo has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Wells Fargo, it has a TSR of 167% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Wells Fargo has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 28% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 22% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Wells Fargo you should be aware of.",

Purpose and Policy. Our Nation\u2019s bright future relies on empowered families, engaged communities, and excellent educational opportunities for every child. Unfortunately, the experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars \u2014 and the unaccountable bureaucracy those programs and dollars support \u2014 has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.\n\n\n\nTaxpayers spent around $200 billion at the Federal level on schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of the more than $60 billion they spend annually on Federal school funding. This money is largely distributed by one of the newest Cabinet agencies, the Department of Education, which has existed for less than one fifth of our Nation\u2019s history. The Congress created the Department of Education in 1979 at the urging of President Jimmy Carter, who received a first-ever Presidential endorsement from the country\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union shortly after pledging to the union his support for a separate Department of Education. Since then, the Department of Education has entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that Federal control over education is beneficial. While the Department of Education does not educate anyone, it maintains a public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 million per year.\n\n\n\nClosing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them. Today, American reading and math scores are near historical lows. This year\u2019s National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that 70 percent of 8th graders were below proficient in reading, and 72 percent were below proficient in math. The Federal education bureaucracy is not working.\n\n\n\nClosure of the Department of Education would drastically improve program implementation in higher education. The Department of Education currently manages a student loan debt portfolio of more than $1.6 trillion. This means the Federal student aid program is roughly the size of one of the Nation\u2019s largest banks, Wells Fargo. But although Wells Fargo has more than 200,000 employees, the Department of Education has fewer than 1,500 in its Office of Federal Student Aid. The Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America\u2019s students.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the Department of Education\u2019s main functions can, and should, be returned to the States.\n\n\n\nSec. 2. Closing the Department of Education and Returning Authority to the States. (a) The Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\n\n(b) Consistent with the Department of Education\u2019s authorities, the Secretary of Education shall ensure that the allocation of any Federal Department of Education funds is subject to rigorous compliance with Federal law and Administration policy, including the requirement that any program or activity receiving Federal assistance terminate illegal discrimination obscured under the label \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d or similar terms and programs promoting gender ideology.\n\n\n\nSec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n\n\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n\nMarch 20, 2025.\n\n\n\n",

Fox - Seattle\n\nWells Fargo will lay employees at its Jordan Creek Campus in West Des Moines effective May 18.\n\nThis is the second round of layoffs at the location this month.\n\nWells Fargo has been reducing its workforce in recent years, with 1,078 layoffs since April 2022.\n\nThe bank attributed the layoffs to the need to 'align with market conditions and the needs of our businesses.'\n\nFor the second time this month, Wells Fargo has announced layoffs at its Jordan Creek Campus in West Des Moines, this time for 34 employees effective May 18, according to the state\u2019s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, website.\n\nEarlier in March, Wells Fargo announced the layoff of 33 employees effective April 4.\n\nThe fourth-largest bank in the United States with assets of $1.7 trillion, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, once the largest employer in the Des Moines metro, has been paring back its workforce in recent years. The latest announcement brings the total workforce reductions to 1,078 since April 2022, according to the WARN website.\n\nThe company on Wednesday issued its standard response to a request for comment, saying its leaders \u201cregularly review and adjust staffing levels to align with market conditions and the needs of our businesses.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo also has consistently stated that it works to find opportunities for affected employees in other parts of the company and provides assistance such as severance pay and career counseling if jobs are not available.\n\nThe Wells Fargo website on Wednesday listed 37 job openings in Des Moines and West Des Moines.\n\nThe latest Des Moines metro layoff notices did not indicate in which divisions Wells Fargo was reducing jobs, and the company has declined to specify when asked in past layoffs. The bank\u2019s home mortgage division, heavily concentrated in the Des Moines metro, has throttled back amid higher interest rates and lower demand.\n\nWells Fargo's Des Moines metro employment peaked 14,500 in 2017, but it has since fallen to what the Greater Des Moines Partnership says is \u201cmore than 11,000.\u201d That's eclipsed by the 12,000-plus of the Hy-Vee supermarket chain, which has its headquarters in West Des Moines.\n\nKevin Baskins covers jobs and the economy for the Des Moines Register.

Instead, it serves up personal loans and cash-out refinancing as alternatives.\n\nPersonal loans can be a good option, but the interest rates are often higher than home equity products, and the interest is not tax deductible. Interest paid on a HELOC or HEL can be.\n\nAnd a cash-out refinance may not be a good choice if you have an interest rate on your current mortgage that is lower than today's mortgage rates.\n\nDig deeper: The best cash-out refinance lenders\n\nWells Fargo home mortgage loan rates 2025\n\nThe all-important question every home buyer wants the answer to: What will be my mortgage rate? Wells Fargo has a page listing rates for four of the most common types of mortgage loans: 15- and 30-year fixed-rate conventional loans, 30-year VA loans, and 10/6 adjustable-rate mortgages. A separate tab reveals three refinance rates, for 15- and 30-year fixed refis and a 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance.\n\nThese national rates have varying assumptions as to down payment, credit score, and home location, according to the loan product. When we checked, we saw a 30-year fixed conforming mortgage rate assuming a 20% down payment, 0.875 discount point, and 740 credit score.\n\nTo see an interest rate based on your credit profile, you'll need to provide:\n\nThe location where you are interested in buying\n\nThe purchase price of the home\n\nYour down payment\n\nYour contact information\n\nWells Fargo says the inquiry will not affect your credit score, but you may be contacted by phone, text, and email.\n\nRead more: How to get the lowest mortgage rates\n\nHow Wells Fargo mortgage scores on mortgage rates and loan costs\n\nYahoo Finance uses 2023 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data comprised of 10 million home loan applications to score mortgage lenders on issued mortgage rates and total loan costs. We score each lender on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).\n\nFor example, regarding mortgage rates, a lender with a lower score charged a higher-than-median mortgage interest rate for loans issued in 2023. A higher score would indicate that a lender granted lower-than-median home loan interest rates to borrowers in 2023.\n\nWith total home loan costs, a lower score would indicate that a lender charged higher-than-median total home loan costs in 2023. A high rating would mean that a mortgage lender offered lower-than-median all-in home loan costs in 2023.\n\nWells Fargo home loan rates score: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nWells Fargo total loan costs score: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nWhat this means: Wells Fargo mortgage offered a much-lower-than-median mortgage rate of 6.25% and a lower-than-median total loan cost of $5,603.88 to borrowers in 2023.\n\nWells Fargo mortgage application\n\nWells Fargo offers a prequalification process that provides an estimated mortgage interest rate, as noted above. It will also let you know the loan amount \"you may qualify for.\" It's a good starting point, but when you are ready to get serious and start house hunting, you'll want to secure a mortgage preapproval.\n\nWells Fargo mortgage preapproval\n\nThe online preapproval and application process is driven by a third-party application many lenders use, so it's typical of what you'll find just about everywhere.\n\nYou'll need to have a good deal of financial information on hand and ready to upload. If you're an existing customer, the bank can prefill some of the info.\n\nRead more: How long is mortgage preapproval good for?\n\nIf you're ready to run some numbers, Wells Fargo has one primary calculator: home affordability. Three other \"calculators\" are actually prequalification workflows for a home purchase, refinance, or cash-out refinance.\n\nYou can search for homes and get an estimate on your current home's value with two tools available only to existing Wells Fargo customers. You can track prices on homes you're interested in or explore recent sales to see how values are trending in your area.\n\nWells Fargo isn't loaded with home-buying tools and resources, but there are enough to get a first-timer started or to help a refinancing homeowner.\n\nDig deeper: How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWells Fargo mortgage pros and cons\n\nPros\n\nWells Fargo earns 5 stars in our Interest Rates category for providing much-lower-than-average mortgage rates to borrowers, based on 2023 data.\n\nLoan costs are also lower than average. That deserves 4 stars and the right to be on the shortlist for home loan shoppers.\n\nWith a long list of loan options, Wells Fargo earns 4 stars for affordability. We would like to see some second mortgage options, though, namely HELOCs and home equity loans.\n\nCons\n\nMortgage rate transparency leaves a little to be desired and garners the bank an average 3-star score.\n\nThe library of learning resources is also skimpy and earns a low 2-star rating.\n\nHow Wells Fargo Home Mortgage compares to other mortgage lenders\n\nWells Fargo mortgages vs. Bank of America mortgages\n\nLarge banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America are known for community development initiatives. It's part of their charter as national banks and stems from the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. So, both banks offer generous home-buying incentives to low- and moderate-income households.\n\nHowever, their loan products differ when it comes to home equity products for homeowners. Wells Fargo does not offer home equity loans or HELOCs, while Bank of America has both.\n\nFor first-time homebuyers, either bank can be a good choice. For home equity solutions, Bank of America stands apart.\n\nWells Fargo mortgages vs. PNC Bank mortgages\n\nWells Fargo and PNC Bank have a lot in common. Both were established in 1852 and grew from a regional service footprint \u2014 Wells Fargo in the West and PNC in the East \u2014 to ultimately become nationally known financial institutions.\n\nBoth have the breadth of services customers expect from large banks. Yet, there are some key differences. PNC offers a home loan program for medical professionals; Wells Fargo does not.\n\nBoth have grants available to first-time homebuyers in certain areas; Wells Fargo offers up to $10,000, but you might qualify for up to $15,000 with PNC.\n\nMatching your needs to the best mortgage lender takes a little research.\n\nWells Fargo mortgage FAQs\n\nWhat is the 800 number for Wells Fargo mortgage?\n\nFor buying or refinancing a home, you can speak to a Wells Fargo mortgage consultant by calling 1-877-937-9357.\n\nIs Wells Fargo a good bank for a mortgage loan?\n\nWith a record of offering low mortgage rates and lower-than-average loan costs (according to Yahoo Finance research), we think the answer is yes. Shopping Wells Fargo, along with two or three other lenders, will be the true test.\n\nIs Wells Fargo getting rid of mortgages?\n\nNo. However, Wells Fargo made headlines in 2023 when it announced that the bank would only be offering mortgage loans to existing customers. If you are not currently a Wells Fargo bank customer, you may be out of luck.\n\nMethodology:\n\nYahoo Finance reviews and scores mortgage lenders with quintile scoring in five primary categories: 1) Interest rates. Using 2023 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data comprised of 10 million home loan applications, we score mortgage lenders on issued mortgage rates below or above the annual median of reporting lenders. 2) Affordability. A measure of loan product availability and the willingness of a lender to offer government-backed loans, low down payments, down payment assistance, and consideration of nontraditional credit. 3) Loan costs. HMDA data is again analyzed, and lenders are rated based on total loan costs compared to the annual median. 4) Rate transparency. The ability of a website user to obtain a mortgage interest rate estimate. We score lenders based on whether rates are enhanced with discount points or high credit score requirements, disclaimers revealing rate assumptions, sample advertised rates, and whether adjustable or no discount point rate estimates are available. 5) Online features. An analysis of the educational material, calculators, and additional resources available to users.\n\nReview of Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) data on regulatory actions can trigger a penalty to the score of any lender with a consumer mortgage-related administrative or enforcement action within the past five years.\n\nAdvertisers or sponsorships do not influence ratings.\n\nEditorial disclosure for mortgages:\n\nThe information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser. The details on financial products, including interest rates and fees, are accurate as of the publish date. All products or services are presented without warranty.

            "content": "Key Takeaways Mortgage rates are likely to stay above 6% through 2026, according to a Wells Fargo report that showed continued pressure on affordability across the housing market.\n\nHome borrowing costs were likely to stay elevated despite more interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, economists said.\n\nHome prices are also expected to accelerate as inventory shortages remain a problem amid tepid housing construction forecasts, the bank\u2019s economists projected.\n\nSpring may be coming, but economists at Wells Fargo don\u2019t see much of a thaw for the housing market.\n\nInterest rates for 30-year-fixed mortgages will likely average 6.9% in 2025 before ticking lower to around 6.5% the following year, Wells Fargo economists projected this week. The average mortgage rate was 6.7% last week after surging to more than 7% in January.\n\n\u201cIt's going to be a challenging environment, in our view, over the next couple of years because we don't expect mortgage rates to, frankly, drop below 6%,\u201d Wells Fargo economist Jackie Benson said.\n\nHousing Market Returns to \u2018New, Old Normal\u2019\n\nWhile Wells Fargo believes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates three times this year, they don\u2019t expect it to affect home borrowing costs much. It follows a pattern in 2024 when the Fed cut interest rates by a percentage point over the course of the year, but mortgage rates still pushed higher, mainly due to a rise in Treasury yields.\n\nLow interest rates like those offered in the years before the pandemic aren't returning any time soon, said Wells Fargo Chief Economist Jay Bryson.\n\n\u201cUnless something cataclysmic happens to the economy, we seriously doubt you're looking at a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage of 3%,\u201d Bryson said. \u201cSo what we have is a new, old normal, if you will. An economy in which interest rates aren't zero. It's the economy that many of us lived through before the cataclysms of the global financial crisis and the pandemic.\u201d\n\nRising Home Prices, Insurance Costs Diminish Outlook on Housing Affordability\n\nThe outlook isn\u2019t particularly rosy for other homebuying costs either.\n\n\u201cThe major issue here is the same one that's been weighing on the residential market for much of the past few years, and that's that affordability is extremely unfavorable for buyers,\u201d Dougherty said.\n\nHome prices are expected to accelerate, with a projected annual increase of 4.3% this year before rising even higher in the following year, according to the report. Home price increases had cooled to below 4% in the latter months of 2024. High prices are hurting home sales, which are running about 22% below pre-pandemic levels, Senior Economist Charlie Dougherty said.\n\nMeanwhile, home construction is expected to remain on par with today\u2019s levels, which won't fill the shortage of around 4 million homes that has stymied the market.\n\nAdditionally, rising insurance costs are another expense that is adding to the pressure on the housing market. The Wells Fargo economists pointed to S&P Global data that showed home insurance costs rose 10.4% in 2024, an acceleration from its average increase of about 3% between 2019 and 2022.\n\nIn addition, tariffs and immigration policy could also increase housing costs in the short-term, though favorable tax and regulatory changes might help spur demand in the long run, the economists said.\n\n",

            "content": "Source Cryptopolitan\n\nTesla has already lost half its value since December, but Wells Fargo says it could fall another 40%. Colin Langan, an analyst at the bank, lowered his 12-month price target from $135 to $130 on Friday and maintained an underweight rating. His new forecast means the company could drop 46% from where it is now.\n\nThe Wall Street average price target for Tesla is $372, but Langan\u2019s outlook tells a different story. \u201cWe\u2019ve been bearish on Tesla\u2019s sales and margins since last year, and the concerns were largely correct,\u201d Langan said. He pointed to a 40% drop in European sales this year, which triggered the latest stock decline. That\u2019s not the only problem. Protests and vandalism have hit the company\u2019s facilities, and with no sales growth in sight, Langan believes the stock\u2019s downward momentum will continue.\n\nTesla\u2019s European sales collapse adds to the crisis\n\nTesla is on track for its eighth straight weekly loss, the longest losing streak since it went public in 2010. In Europe, the company\u2019s January sales fell 45%.\n\nThe problem is bigger than just weak demand. The company is dealing with political backlash after Elon Musk backed Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party in recent elections. The response has been brutal. Customers are abandoning the brand, and the company\u2019s facilities in Europe have been vandalized.\n\nLangan says many investors saw weaker profits coming, but they didn\u2019t want to bet against the stock. Now, they don\u2019t have a choice. \u201cDespite the 40% drop this year, we still see another 40% downside,\u201d he said. \u201cIf fundamentals matter, the momentum likely turns negative as consensus estimates fall.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t the only company losing support. UBS and Redburn Atlantic have also reiterated sell ratings, adding to the pressure.\n\nTesla and SpaceX fight U.S. trade policies\n\nTesla isn\u2019t just battling falling demand. The company is also getting hit by tariffs. On Friday, Tesla and SpaceX sent letters to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, raising concerns about Trump\u2019s tariff policies.\n\nTesla\u2019s letter, submitted by Miriam Eqab, associate general counsel, said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are driving up the cost of Tesla\u2019s U.S.-made vehicles. \u201cU.S. exporters are disproportionately impacted when other countries retaliate against U.S. trade actions,\u201d the letter said. The company warned that these tariffs are making its vehicles less competitive, both at home and overseas.\n\nSpaceX had a different problem. The company\u2019s Starlink satellite service is facing foreign trade barriers that increase its costs. \u201cThe import duties in some countries significantly increase Starlink\u2019s operating costs, while the U.S. has no such tariffs on competing products,\u201d said Mat Dunn, senior director of global business and government affairs at SpaceX.\n\nThe letters were part of a public comment process, with over 700 companies responding to Trump\u2019s trade policies. But the message was clear: tariffs are making its cars more expensive, damaging sales, and cutting into profitability.\n\nCryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Blair was tapped for the role of CIO in the company\u2019s branch and ATM division, Tracy Kerrins, consumer CIO and head of enterprise generative AI at Wells Fargo, said on LinkedIn.\n\nBlair brings with her two decades of technology leadership experience in banking and financial services, most recently at Discover, where she served as SVP of consumer banking technology for over a year, according to her LinkedIn profile. Prior to that, she spent 17 years at JPMorgan Chase in numerous roles, including head of technology, CTO and application development director.\n\nBlair will be based out of Wells Fargo\u2019s new technology hub in Columbus, Ohio, and report to Kerrins. \u201cHeather has tremendous technical depth and expertise in branch and ATM channels spending nearly two decades at JPMorgan,\u201d the company said in an email.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWells Fargo is midway through a decade-long modernization push that\u2019s brought several key technology leadership changes over the last several years.

Colin Langan, an analyst at the bank, lowered his 12-month price target from $135 to $130 on Friday and maintained an underweight rating. His new forecast means the company could drop 46% from where it is now.\n\nThe Wall Street average price target for Tesla is $372, but Langan\u2019s outlook tells a different story. \u201cWe\u2019ve been bearish on Tesla\u2019s sales and margins since last year, and the concerns were largely correct,\u201d Langan said. He pointed to a 40% drop in European sales this year, which triggered the latest stock decline. That\u2019s not the only problem. Protests and vandalism have hit the company\u2019s facilities, and with no sales growth in sight, Langan believes the stock\u2019s downward momentum will continue.\n\nTesla\u2019s European sales collapse adds to the crisis\n\nTesla is on track for its eighth straight weekly loss, the longest losing streak since it went public in 2010. In Europe, the company\u2019s January sales fell 45%.\n\nThe problem is bigger than just weak demand. The company is dealing with political backlash after Elon Musk backed Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party in recent elections. The response has been brutal. Customers are abandoning the brand, and the company\u2019s facilities in Europe have been vandalized.\n\nLangan says many investors saw weaker profits coming, but they didn\u2019t want to bet against the stock. Now, they don\u2019t have a choice. \u201cDespite the 40% drop this year, we still see another 40% downside,\u201d he said. \u201cIf fundamentals matter, the momentum likely turns negative as consensus estimates fall.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t the only company losing support. UBS and Redburn Atlantic have also reiterated sell ratings, adding to the pressure.\n\nTesla and SpaceX fight U.S. trade policies\n\nTesla isn\u2019t just battling falling demand. The company is also getting hit by tariffs. On Friday, Tesla and SpaceX sent letters to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, raising concerns about Trump\u2019s tariff policies.\n\nTesla\u2019s letter, submitted by Miriam Eqab, associate general counsel, said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are driving up the cost of Tesla\u2019s U.S.-made vehicles. \u201cU.S. exporters are disproportionately impacted when other countries retaliate against U.S. trade actions,\u201d the letter said. The company warned that these tariffs are making its vehicles less competitive, both at home and overseas.\n\nSpaceX had a different problem. The company\u2019s Starlink satellite service is facing foreign trade barriers that increase its costs. \u201cThe import duties in some countries significantly increase Starlink\u2019s operating costs, while the U.S. has no such tariffs on competing products,\u201d said Mat Dunn, senior director of global business and government affairs at SpaceX.\n\nThe letters were part of a public comment process, with over 700 companies responding to Trump\u2019s trade policies. But the message was clear: tariffs are making its cars more expensive, damaging sales, and cutting into profitability.\n\nCryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The Wells Fargo analyst cut his first-quarter delivery estimates for Tesla to 360,000 vehicles, noting that the company\u2019s price cuts on vehicles are having \u201cdiminishing benefits.\u201d In the first week of March, Goldman Sachs also lowered its delivery estimates for Tesla to 375,000 units. On March 5, 2025, the consensus for Tesla\u2019s Q1 2025 deliveries was 426,000 vehicles.\n\nLangan commented that the electric vehicle (EV) competition in China is intense.

He added that some of the \u201crazzle dazzle momentum\u201d in TSLA stocks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election was spoiled by the company\u2019s weakening car business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his bleak outlook for Tesla in the first quarter, Langan sees some light in the company\u2019s near future. He predicted that Tesla deliveries would rebound to 450,000 vehicles in the second quarter, thanks to the 2025 Model Y Juniper. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas predicts TSLA stocks could rebound by 90% within the next year.\n\nThe Wells Fargo analyst also predicts that Tesla might launch its \u201caffordable Model 2.5,\u201d which could boost deliveries. Sources in China shared that Tesla plans to release a cheaper Tesla Model Y variant, similar to the more affordable Model 3 it released in Mexico.\n\nLangan\u2019s full-year 2025 delivery estimate for Tesla is a little under 1.7 million vehicles, slightly below the company\u2019s delivery numbers in 2024.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWells Fargo executives welcomed Heather Blair to the bank\u2019s technology team Monday. Blair was tapped for the role of CIO in the company\u2019s branch and ATM division, Tracy Kerrins, consumer CIO and head of enterprise generative AI at Wells Fargo, said on LinkedIn.\n\nBlair brings with her two decades of technology leadership experience in banking and financial services, most recently at Discover Financial Services, where she served as SVP of consumer banking technology for over a year, according to her LinkedIn profile. Prior to that, she spent 17 years at JPMorgan Chase in numerous roles, including head of technology, CTO and application development director.\n\nBlair will be based out of Wells Fargo\u2019s new technology hub in Columbus, Ohio, and report to Kerrins. \u201cHeather has tremendous technical depth and expertise in branch and ATM channels spending nearly two decades at JPMorgan,\u201d the company said in an email.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWells Fargo is midway through a decade-long modernization push that\u2019s brought several key technology leadership changes over the last several years. Technology infrastructure modernization is ongoing at the bank, which earmarked $900 million for incremental technology investments this year, CFO Mike Santomassimo said in a January earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe continue to invest in technology and digital platforms to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers,\u201d Santomassimo said. \u201cThis includes continuing the transition of our applications to the cloud, migrating into new data centers and investing in data platforms to drive more insights.\u201d\n\nBlair is the latest technology executive hired by the company to help drive modernization efforts across its banking businesses.\n\nLast year, the bank welcomed SVP and Head of Technology Bridget Engle, an industry veteran who previously served as CIO and head of engineering at BNY for seven years and as a CIO and CTO at Bank of America during the prior six years. Wells Fargo elevated Kerrins from within to lead the banks\u2019 generative AI strategy concurrently.\n\n\u201cOur new generative AI team will work closely with our data and technology platform management teams, as well as each business, on identifying and delivering on the potential of generative AI responsibly,\u201d Wells Fargo President and CEO Charlie Scharf said in a July announcement.\n\nKerrins rose to head of technology as part of a C-suite reshuffle that elevated Saul Van Beurden to senior EVP and CEO of consumer and small business banking in 2023. Van Beurden is a JPMorgan Chase veteran who served for five years as the company\u2019s CIO of consumer and community banking.\n\nAt the Columbus hub, Blair joins another former JPMorgan Chase colleague, Wells Fargo CIO of Core Banking Technology Alan Varrasso, who was onboarded in 2022. The two executives\u2019 time at JPMorgan Chase overlapped for ten years prior to 2022.\n\n\u201cHaving had the opportunity to work with Heather in the past, I\u2019ve seen firsthand her leadership, vision, and impact,\u201d Varrasso said on LinkedIn. \u201cShe brings a wealth of experience to the organization and more importantly is a true champion for female technology talent.\u201d",

            "content": "Blog Post | March 12, 2025\n\nCorporate profiteers want to ransack an institution older than America itself.\n\nAt a Morgan Stanley conference last week, Elon Musk told attendees the federal government should privatize \u201cas much as possible\u201d \u2013 and singled out the U.S. Postal Service as a top target.\n\nMusk\u2019s comments are the latest in an alarming push from Trump\u2019s team to strip-mine America\u2019s oldest and second-most popular agency (USPS narrowly trails the National Parks Service, another victim of Musk\u2019s austerity chainsaw). Trump \u2013 who has long feuded with the Postal Service over mail-in balloting \u2013 stated in December he was \u201clooking at\u201d privatizing USPS. The Washington Post recently reported on Trump\u2019s plans to end USPS\u2019 independent status and move it to the corporate-captured Commerce Department, where it would be under the direct control of billionaire ex-banker Howard Lutnick.\n\nThough Trump has yet to make anything official, Big Business is already giddy at getting its hands on USPS\u2019 valuable assets. A leaked February 27 paper from Wells Fargo\u2019s equity research team lays out in disturbing detail how Wall Street and corporate couriers could profit from a privatized Postal Service.\n\nWells Fargo Report is DOGE-esque Roadmap for Looting USPS\n\nThe Wells Fargo report, entitled \u201cUSPS Privatization: A Framework\u201d, includes many eye-catching tidbits about what privatization could mean for customers, workers, and corporate investors. The biggest takeaways:\n\nPostage Prices: The report recommends carving out USPS\u2019 parcel delivery operations to either IPO or sell to private competitors like FedEx and UPS. It states that \u201craising [parcel] prices would be likely\u201d under privatization, by as much as 30 to 140% across parcel products. This would hurt millions of e-commerce sellers and small businesses who rely on USPS\u2019 statutory commitment to affordable pricing, and have similar inflationary effects for consumers.\n\nScrapping universal service: Wells Fargo describes USPS\u2019 universal service obligation (USO) \u2013 a statutory requirement to provide a minimum level of service at reasonable prices to ALL domestic addresses \u2013 as an \u201crestructuring issue\u201d to be addressed. The analysts propose severing USPS\u2019 lucrative parcel business from its less profitable letter mail delivery, selling the former to private investors and potentially leaving taxpayers on the hook for the latter. Without the USO, parcel and package delivery to regions deemed \u201cunprofitable\u201d (such as rural communities) could be scaled back or cease entirely, while public 6-day letter mail service could enter a death spiral.\n\nSelling off postal real estate: The Wells Fargo report takes note of USPS\u2019 8,500 properties, which include historic post offices, sorting centers, and vital rural community hubs. It notes ominously that \u201cvalue can be harvested\u201d by \u201cunlocking\u201d these properties via sale or lease to commercial bidders (who could include real estate developers, corporate landlords, private couriers, or retail monopolists like Amazon).\n\nLayoffs and Pension Obligations: Citing \u201crecent DOGE efforts on federal cost control\u201d, the report states that USPS\u2019 600,000-person workforce \u2013 91 percent of whom are unionized \u2013 would either receive deferred buyout offers or see mass layoffs as a \u201crequired step\u201d of privatization. The authors expect \u201csizable opposition\u201d to privatization from postal workers, noting USPS\u2019 \u201cunion dynamics and collective bargaining agreements\u201d. Another \u201crequired step\u201d involves shifting $400B in postal pension and healthcare liabilities to taxpayers (as the UK\u2019s Royal Mail did), or selling off parcel operations and postal real estate to fund workers\u2019 hard-earned retirement benefits. In other words, privatizing the profits and socializing the losses.\n\nPath to privatization: Wells Fargo floats scrapping the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 (which turned USPS into an independent agency after the Great Postal Strike) by sneaking PRA repeal into the GOP\u2019s forthcoming budget package. The report concedes that privatization would be unlikely to garner 60 Senate votes, meaning it would have to be attached to \u201cmust-pass\u201d legislation to become law.\n\n\u201cChallenges\u201d to privatization : The report notes that USPS enjoys strong bipartisan support among the public, and that its delivery of election ballots, medicine, taxes, and government distributions and notices (e.g. Social Security checks) would make privatization politically toxic. It also observes the \u201cparticularly strong affinity\u201d rural communities have for USPS, and its offering of financial services in unbanked or under-banked areas. Singling out those specific services is a blaring alarm that a privatized USPS would gut them. Wall Street\u2019s lobbying helped bring an end to the US Postal Savings System and has helped thwart recent efforts to revive postal banking.\n\n: The report notes that USPS enjoys strong bipartisan support among the public, and that its delivery of election ballots, medicine, taxes, and government distributions and notices (e.g. Social Security checks) would make privatization politically toxic.

Singling out those specific services is a blaring alarm that a privatized USPS would gut them.\n\nOnce Again: Postal Privatization is a Bad Idea\n\nWhile this report may only be the work of one repeat-offender bank, it does echo the broader views and mission of the pro-privatization crowd (whose most recent evangelists include Hack Watch regulars Jason Calacanis and Matt Yglesias).\n\nCorporations and think tanks like the Cato Institute, Heritage Foundation, and postal contractor Pitney Bowes have lobbied for decades to kill USPS and sell its assets to the private sector. During the first Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin led a task force that called for shrinking the Postal Service and stripping its workers of collective bargaining rights. Mnuchin later engineered the appointment of Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General, whose death-by-thousand-cuts austerity plan for the agency has left it even more vulnerable to privatization.\n\nMake no mistake: if these privatization hawks get their way, corporate investors and shareholders will reap a windfall \u2013 while everyone else will suffer.\n\nPostal Privatization Harms Mail Recipients: Postal privatization would likely mean the end of the universal service obligation and 6-day delivery standard, as corporate carriers would seek to profit-maximize by conducting fewer weekly delivery trips or avoiding routes with fewer residents. This could result in millions of mail items and packages arriving late (including time-sensitive tax or legal documents, medication, government benefit checks, and election ballots) \u2013 or not at all. Rural, indigenous, and remote communities (where private couriers often rely on USPS for \u201clast-mile delivery\u201d) are particularly at risk of being cut off.\n\nPostal Privatization Harms Customers & Small Businesses: Steep postage hikes to satisfy corporate investors and shareholders (as the Wells Fargo report recommends) would raise costs on postal retail customers, including millions of small businesses and e-commerce sellers on platforms like eBay, Mercari, and Etsy. Lightweight packages (below 1lb) could see the biggest price hikes under privatization, as USPS\u2019 current Ground Advantage offering is often significantly cheaper than similar offerings from FedEx and UPS.\n\nPostal Privatization Harms Workers: Privatization would likely mean mass layoffs to USPS\u2019 600,000-person workforce, which has historically been a road to the middle-class for non-white workers. Pay, working conditions, and benefits could also get worse for postal workers under privatization if USPS\u2019 operations are absorbed by union-busting corporations like Amazon or FedEx. Workers\u2019 pensions could also be at risk, either under the taxpayer-funded scenario outlined by Wells Fargo or by corporations with track records of mismanaging retirement benefits.\n\nPostal Privatization Harms The Public: A privatized postal service would have no obligation to prioritize or provide public services, like timely delivery of election ballots or infectious disease test-kits. Rural areas could lose more than mail service: rural post offices at risk of sale function as community hubs, while rural carriers often assist in local emergency response and national disasters. There would be few to no mechanisms to hold a privatized postal service accountable to the public, like an Inspector General or board meetings that allow public comment. (The Postal Board of Governors has recently rolled back public comment periods at its quarterly board meetings, now only allowing them once per year.)\n\nThese are not theoretical harms. The 2013 privatization of Royal Mail in the UK has already led to steep postage hikes, plummeting on-time delivery rates, job cuts, and chronic mismanagement of worker pensions.\n\nProtect and Expand the Post Office\n\nIf they follow through on privatization threats, Musk and Trump will be attacking an American institution older than the country itself and one of the few agencies explicitly authorized by the Constitution. It would be Trump\u2019s own voters who suffer the most under privatization: 57% of United States post offices and 88% of land served by USPS is located in rural America, where Trump won 63% of the vote.\n\nUSPS\u2019 bipartisan popularity offers a glimmer of hope that Trump will back off from gutting it. Consider Louis DeJoy\u2019s stealth-privatization agenda for the Postal Service, which has become so unpopular that even Republican members of Congress have grilled the outgoing Postmaster General on mail delays and postage rate hikes hurting their constituents. Any plan that would make these problems worse could be killed by just a few Congressional Republicans \u2013 but only if they fear their voters\u2019 wrath more than Musk\u2019s.\n\nThis gives Democrats an opening to not just oppose Musk and Trump\u2019s Wall Street-backed scheme to loot the Post Office, but also embrace a forward-thinking vision for a public Postal Service. The People\u2019s Postal Agenda provides exactly this roadmap, envisioning the restoration of postal banking and innovative new services like broadband expansion and local grocery delivery.\n\nThis is an existential fight for one of America\u2019s oldest and most treasured public services. Neither Musk nor Trump nor gloom of night should stay Democrats from protecting it.",

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned -15.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -8.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has lost 16.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share, indicating a change of -1.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.87 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.85 indicates a change of +16.7% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Wells Fargo is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).",

            "content": "The removal of Wells Fargo's $1.95 trillion asset cap holds a hidden benefit \u2013 billions upon billions of dollars in savings. Wells Fargo has been paying no small fortune to chip away at all of the regulatory fallout from past misdeeds at the bank, including the 2018 Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap and a long list of consent orders with other agencies. Charlie Scharf was brought in as CEO in 2019 to clean things up after the 2016 fake accounts scandal and others. A few weeks ago, Wells Fargo closed its 10th consent order , leaving four remaining. Proving that the bank has changed its ways has been a precursor to convincing the Fed to remove the cap. Many analysts believe the Fed will lift the cap, perhaps even this year. President Donald Trump 's softer approach to government regulation has raised hopes that it will happen sooner rather than later. Free of the cap, Wells Fargo's ability to expand is well documented. However, what is less known is how much the bank would save in costs allocated to staffing and running operations to comply with the conditions to clear the orders. During Wells Fargo's post-earnings conference call in January, management forecasted expenses for 2025 that include operating losses of $1.1 billion \u2014 part of which goes to risk and control infrastructure. That's $700 million less than last year. When asked about spending on remediation efforts, a Wells Fargo spokesperson pointed to its latest annual report, which indicated that the bank paid $2.5 billion more in 2023 than in 2018. Raymond James analyst David Long also said Wells Fargo's operating losses would likely narrow even further if the cap were to be lifted. \"A portion of it can be reinvested in revenue-generating expenses \u2014 whether it's incremental hiring or improving internal operations or infrastructure,\" Long recently told CNBC. \"Having a larger balance sheet would be great, but on the expense side there's upside to the bottom line as well,\" Long added. To be sure, some of those expenses will likely \"stay and remain in compliance.\" Operating expenses Enhancing compliance and risk management has been the cornerstone of Wells' operational strategy since Scharf took over. The bank has significantly invested in hiring and has added approximately 10,000 people across its numerous risk and control groups, according to Wells Fargo's 2023 annual report, which was released in March 2024. The bank has also implemented new systems to mitigate operational risks, including revamping its employee incentive structures within its branches to avoid missteps that led to the cross-selling scandal and other misconduct. \"Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work,\" CFO Michael Santomassimo said during the company's Jan. 15 earnings call. All of these expenses seemed to have been worth it. Wells Fargo management announced the termination of four consent orders alone since the start of February and still has four more to go. That progress seen as needed in its bid to get the Fed to lift the asset cap drove shares to a record closing high of $81.42 back on Feb. 6. Since then, however, Wells Fargo has pulled back roughly 18%, as of the close on Monday, which continued a terrible recent stretch for the overall market due to economic uncertainty stemming from concern about the impact of President Donald Trump 's tariffs. The stock has done worse than the S & P 500 's loss of more than 8.5% since its record high close on Feb. 16. Trump is expected to meet with business leaders Tuesday evening. WFC YTD mountain Wells Fargo (WFC) year-to-date performance After the asset cap Stock performance aside, imagine what those billions could go to once Wells Fargo doesn't need to account for expenses toward removing its asset cap. Management could focus on further expanding budding lucrative businesses. Although Wells Fargo is commonly known as a money center bank, it has made efforts to grow its capital markets, trading, and investment banking (IB) businesses. In recent years, Wells has gone on a hiring spree for senior-level employees to boost its Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) division. An IB expansion is a wise move for Wells because the business garners fees from Wall Street dealmaking via initial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions (M & A), which helps to further diversify the company's revenue streams further. It also allows Wells to not rely so heavily on interest-based income for its bottom line, which is at the mercy of the Fed's policy decisions. While perceived as business-friendly, IPOs and M & A were expected to increase under Trump. The economic turbulence over tariffs, however, has raised concerns about when that activity might pick up. Those questions have been a factor in recent bank stock weakness as well. To be sure, Scharf has said that Wells Fargo is going to be \"very deliberate about how we go about business expansion,\" if, and/or when, regulators remove the cap. During the company's last earnings call, the CEO added, \"We're not going to sit here and say, 'The shackles are off. Therefore, the following ten things are going to change materially.'\" He continued, \"It's going to be disciplined, thoughtful, piece by piece, in a very controlled way, and only in places that are supported by the controls that we have in place.\" But even with the current lid on Wells' balance sheet, there are signs that this CIB expansion is already paying off. Wells Fargo's IB fees surged 59% to $725 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The bank beat on earnings but missed expectations for revenue. We bumped our price target to $84 apiece from $80 at the time and maintained our hold-equivalent 2 rating. The timing of a Wells Fargo asset cap removal remains uncertain. Management has not commented on it directly. Raymond James models that the cap may come off in the second half of 2026. \"I do believe that is a conservative forecast,\" Long said. \"Given that we have seen four consent orders come off recently, there's [even] a pretty decent chance that the asset cap will be removed this year.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long WFC.

But it doled out the debt anyway.\n\nThe suit \u2014 first reported by Reuters \u2014 also alleges that the Chetrit Group was aware that the numbers had been fudged by the seller Roco Real Estate.\n\nRoco and the 43-property deal have been central to a widening federal investigation into mortgage fraud. In 2023, Roco principal Tyler Ross pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit an offense against the United States related to a previous financing of the properties. He was sentenced to a year in federal prison in September.\n\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have uncovered that in multiple deals, operators routinely manipulated property financials such as expenses to obtain larger loans from lenders than they would have otherwise secured.\n\nSo far, at least six real estate operators across the U.S. have pleaded guilty. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s filing marks the first major lawsuit against a lender in the broader commercial mortgage fraud scandal. Lenders have largely claimed to be victims of borrowers\u2019 fraud.\n\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did an attorney for Wells Fargo.\n\nChetrit, through a spokesperson, pointed the finger at Roco, calling itself \u201ca victim of seller fraud, which was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinancial misrepresentations were made by the seller that we unknowingly relied upon when we purchased the property,\u201d said a Chetrit representative in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe suffered great financial loss due to the seller\u2019s fraud,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs a result of the fraud, the seller was convicted.\u201d\n\nThe saga dates back to 2019 when Chetrit was shopping for debt to buy Roco\u2019s apartment deal. Through due diligence, it allegedly found Roco had falsified trailing 12 month financial statements, notably inflating net operating income by 25 percent.\n\nChetrit found $3.5 million in reported income did not exist and $2.6 million in repair costs and expenses were missing, according to the lawsuit. It allegedly flagged the errors to Roco and the seller fessed up to the flubs, agreeing to slash the sale price by over $65 million.",

One of its accounts can offer good rates if you're able to maintain a high balance, but online banks still give better interest.\n\nWells Fargo is one of the largest brick-and-mortar financial institutions in the United States. The bank has two savings accounts: the Wells Fargo Platinum Savings Account and Wells Fargo Way2Save\u00ae Savings Account.\n\nCompare Wells Fargo Savings Rates\n\nCurrent Wells Fargo Savings Rates\n\nWells Fargo Way2Save Savings Account\n\nThe Wells Fargo Way2Save\u00ae Savings Account offers a low interest rate of 0.01% APY. It has several ways to waive the $5 monthly service fee and has an automatic savings tool, but its rate makes it a less interesting choice.\n\nThe account offers the Save As You Go feature, which automatically transfers $1 into the account every time you pay a bill or make a debit card purchase with a linked Wells Fargo checking account. This can help you figure out how to budget toward your financial goals.\n\nWells Fargo Platinum Savings Account\n\nThe Wells Fargo Platinum Savings Account has a tiered interest rate system that ranges from 0.01% to 2.51% APY. The rate you earn is based on your account balance, as well as what checking account you have linked.\n\nTo be eligible for relationship rates, you must link a savings account to Wells Fargo Prime Checking or Wells Fargo Premier Checking. You'll get marginally better rates by linking a Wells Fargo Prime Checking account, but the only way to get a good interest rate is to link a Wells Fargo Premier Checking account.\n\nIf you can maintain $100,000 or more in your account and link a Wells Fargo Premier Checking account, you'll earn more interest than with an average savings account. Online banks still have better rates, though.\n\nHere's more information about the tier system:\n\nAccount Tier Standard APY Relationship APY for Prime Checking Relationship APY for Premier Checking Under $100,000 0.01% 0.02% 0.26% $100,000 to $499,999.99 0.01% 0.02% 1.02% $500,000 to $999,999.99 0.01% 0.02% 2.01% $1 million or more 0.01% 0.02% 2.51%\n\nOverview of Wells Fargo Savings Accounts\n\nHow Wells Fargo Savings Accounts Work\n\nThe primary benefit to banking with Wells Fargo is that you'll have access to one of the biggest banks in the U.S.\n\nWells Fargo has locations in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Washington, DC.\n\nOne of the downsides to Wells Fargo's savings accounts is that they have monthly bank maintenance fees.

You have a couple of options to avoid bank fees with the Wells Fargo Way2Save\u00ae Savings Account.

You can earn slightly higher rates by becoming a member of the Preferred Rewards program. However, to qualify there's a three-month total average balance requirement of $20,000 for the Gold tier, $50,000 for the Platinum tier, and $100,000 for the Platinum Honors tier.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Platinum Savings Account pays higher interest rates than the Bank of America Advantage Savings Account, regardless of your account balance, as long as you're in the best relationship tier. The Bank of America Advantage Savings Account pays 0.01% to 0.04% APY. Wells Fargo also compounds interest daily rather than monthly.\n\nBank of America Review\n\nHow to Open a Wells Fargo Savings Account\n\nYou can open the Wells Fargo Way2Save\u00ae Savings Account or the Wells Fargo Platinum Savings Account online or at a branch.\n\nYou must be at least 18 years old to apply for a savings account online. If you're opening a bank account for a minor, you cannot apply online. You must visit a branch.\n\nWhen applying for an account, you'll need to provide documentation. Wells Fargo accepts the following IDs: a driver's license, a passport, a permanent resident card, or a student ID (for minors).\n\nWells Fargo savings accounts have a $25 minimum opening deposit. If you are funding your savings account by transferring money from another bank account, have your routing and account numbers at hand.\n\nWells Fargo Savings vs. Wells Fargo CDs\n\nCDs, like savings accounts, are federally insured accounts that let you earn interest on your funds. Unlike savings accounts, CDs offer a fixed interest rate. This means your interest rate won't change until the end of your term length.\n\nIn exchange, you can't withdraw money from your CD before the end of the term length without paying early withdrawal penalties. Early withdrawal penalties are generally some amount of the interest you would otherwise receive, such as 90 days of interest. The longer the term length is, the more interest is taken out of your withdrawal.\n\nThe best CD rates tend to be slightly higher than traditional bank accounts.\n\nFor Wells Fargo CDs, you can earn a much higher interest rate from a Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD than from a Wells Fargo savings account. Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD rates range from 3.50% to 4.26% (varies by location) APY, which is higher than any of the tier rates of the Wells Fargo Platinum Savings Account. If you're prepared to give up your money for a while, Wells Fargo CDs might be a good option for you.\n\nIs a Wells Fargo Savings Account Right For You?\n\nThe Wells Fargo Platinum Savings Account pays higher rates than most savings accounts at brick-and-mortar banks, so it may be a decent choice if you want to open a savings account at a large national bank.\n\nHowever, if you aren't looking for a traditional national bank, consider other savings accounts instead. The best online banks still pay significantly more. You can also find banks that do not charge any monthly service fees on savings accounts.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: How We Review Wells Fargo Savings Accounts\n\nWe rate bank accounts on a scale from one to five stars.

Morgan Chase in federal court Monday alleging false financial statements that resulted in investor losses for a $481 million loan issued in 2019.\n\nThe complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by Wells Fargo as a CMBS trustee through special servicer Situs Holdings, alleges that J.P. Morgan was aware of \u201cdramatically inflated\u201d financial information when it originated the loan six years ago for Chetrit Group\u2019s acquisition of 43 multifamily assets.\n\nWells Fargo, the investors\u2019 trustee for the single-borrower JPMCC 2019-MFP CMBS deal, claims in the lawsuit that Chetrit \u201cmassively overstated\u201d historical net operating income (NOI) figures for the properties by 25 percent. The complaint claims that instead of demanding corrected NOI data, J.P. Morgan proceeded with the loan. The borrower eventually defaulted in 2022 and still owes $285 million.\n\n\u201cThe remaining properties that serve as collateral for the mortgage loan are worth far less than that outstanding amount,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nWells Fargo is asking the court to require J.P. Morgan to repurchase the loan at the repurchase price or pay damages for breach of its contract.\n\nWells Fargo and Chetit Group did not immediately return requests for comment. J.P. Morgan declined to comment.\n\nAndrew Coen can be reached at acoen@commercialobserver.com",

            "content": "Shares of major financial companies JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.22%), Wells Fargo (WFC 3.49%), and Warren Buffett holding American Express (AXP 3.59%) were all down significantly on Monday, falling 3.8%, 5.1%, and 2.9%, respectively, as of 12:04 p.m. ET.\n\nThere wasn't much in the way of company-specific news today. Therefore, the sectorwide selling was likely due to comments made by President Donald Trump during an interview over the weekend.\n\nUncertainty over Trump's tariff policy has recently led to recession or stagflation fears; over the weekend, Trump declined to rule out tolerating a recession as a result of the protectionist policies.\n\nAs most know, recessions aren't positive for financial stocks. Thus, investors are de-risking ahead of possible economic turmoil today.\n\n\"What we're doing is very big\"\n\nFinancial stocks initially rallied upon Trump's election, likely due to the anticipation of deregulation and lower taxes.\n\nHowever, a recession is typically bad news for financial stocks. During recessions, people are laid off from work, causing higher defaults on loans, and consumers broadly pull back their spending, which harms card activity and therefore \"swipe fees\" collected by credit card companies such as American Express.\n\nOver the course of the past month, investors grew worried as several consumer sentiment readings fell sharply, projections of GDP growth fell, and jobs growth came in below expectations -- albeit still in positive territory.\n\nAt least some of that negativity has been due to fears over tariffs, specifically recent duties on some imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, which went into effect on March 4. While Trump delayed tariffs on certain goods covered under the 2020 USMCA trade deal with Mexico and Canada, even those exempted goods are expected to get tariffed on April 2.\n\nRecalling his first term, investors had likely thought that if the stock market sold off enough or if the economic numbers got bad enough, the president would give in somewhat on tariff-related protectionist policies. However, in an interview on Sunday with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, Bartiromo asked Trump if he anticipated a recession this year. He responded:\n\nI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We are bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of -- it takes a little time.\n\nInvestors are apparently taking these words to mean that Trump is willing to tolerate a recession this time in order to implement his tariff policies, with the goal of reshoring America's manufacturing base. Therefore, economically sensitive stocks are selling off. Unfortunately, these three financial stocks are in that camp.\n\nBut this sell-off could be an opportunity\n\nSignificant tariffs on imported goods, especially from America's neighbors, haven't really been implemented significantly in the past. So, there is a high amount of uncertainty as to the effects. This is why there has been such a big sell-off.\n\nHowever, it's possible things are getting way too pessimistic, as the economy isn't in a recession now. Jobs are still growing, even at a slower pace than before. There also aren't many economists who predict a recession as their base case for the economy looking forward. Moreover, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell gave a fairly encouraging take on the economy and inflation last Friday. That being said, he declined to offer an opinion on the back-and-forth policy on tariffs, but said the Federal Reserve would react appropriately when they are implemented based on how the economy reacts.\n\nDuring times of uncertainty, markets tend to react quite harshly. However, for those with a long-term perspective, these types of sell-offs can prove to be excellent buying opportunities in quality companies.\n\nWhether or not today's action represents such an opportunity is hard to say. However, it may be time to get out your shopping list. If the U.S. economy is able to weather tariffs without a big recession, it seems like it's probably a better time to be buying quality stocks at their current discounts than selling them.",

            "content": "In the last year, many Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nView our latest analysis for Wells Fargo\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo\n\nThe insider, Ather Williams, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$63.70 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$71.05, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 27% of Ather Williams's holding.\n\nIn the last year Wells Fargo insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nNYSE:WFC Insider Trading Volume March 10th 2025\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Wells Fargo\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Wells Fargo insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$260m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo Tell Us?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Wells Fargo insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Wells Fargo you should know about.",

The broader market\u2019s decline, with all major indices in the red, has added further pressure on Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in the U.S.\n\nWhat To Know: The decline follows remarks by President Donald Trump, who seemed to acknowledge the possibility of a U.S. recession in a Sunday interview with Fox News.\n\nAs a major player in retail banking, commercial lending and wealth management, Wells Fargo is vulnerable to macroeconomic shifts. A potential slowdown in consumer spending and lending activity could have an adverse impact on its financial performance.\n\nRead Also: What\u2019s Going On With Netflix Stock?\n\nAdditionally, rising Treasury yields, hovering around 4.23% for the 10-year Monday afternoon, may affect credit demand and borrowing costs, creating challenges for the bank moving forward.\n\nWhat Else: Treasury yields are a key indicator of the overall cost of borrowing in the economy, and they directly influence the interest rates that banks charge on loans.\n\nWhen Treasury yields rise, it generally leads to higher borrowing costs across the board, including for mortgages, auto loans and business loans\u2014products that Wells Fargo heavily depends on for revenue generation.\n\nHigher yields also tend to make bonds more attractive relative to equities, which can shift investor focus away from bank stocks and other riskier assets.\n\nRead Also: Bitcoin\u2019s Drops Below $80,000: Correction Or Buying Opportunity?\n\nHow To Buy WFC Stock\n\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Wells Fargo \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\n\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u201cfractional shares,\u201d which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.\n\nIn the case of Wells Fargo, which is trading at $65.63 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 1.5 shares of stock.\n\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u201cgo short\u201d a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\n\nAccording to data from Benzinga Pro, WFC has a 52-week high of $81.50 and a 52-week low of $50.15.",

From Valley\u2019s chances at a three-peat in Class 4A to upset potential in Class 2A, there's a lot to keep an eye on during the tournament.\n\nEvery year, there are stories written on the court in Wells Fargo Arena. Ahead of the five-day tournament, the Register compiled five storylines to monitor.\n\nMore: 2025 Iowa high school boys basketball state tournament brackets, schedule released\n\nIs Valley capable of pulling off a three-peat in Class 4A?\n\nTwo years ago, the Register didn\u2019t even pick Valley to make it to the championship game. Last year, our staff picked the Tigers, but thought other teams could keep Valley from repeating as state champions.\n\nThis year, our pick went to Cedar Falls, which beat Valley in the regular season.\n\nThe moral of the story here is that B.J. Windhorst\u2019s squad is a tough team to beat in the regular season and, somehow, the Tigers are an even tougher opponent in tournament settings. This is the type of team that should never \u2013 genuinely, never \u2013 be underestimated.\n\nSo, to answer the question: Yes, Valley is capable of pulling off a three-peat. More than capable. But with the way this bracket shook out, it may be more of an uphill climb than in years past.\n\nMore: Iowa high school boys state basketball tournament: Predicting all four champions\n\nWill Mason Bechen break the 800-point mark during the state tournament?\n\nThe North Linn senior guard sits at 752 total points on the season, the second-most statewide. That\u2019s only seven points behind the leader, Prince of Peace\u2019s Hakeal Powell, who saw his season ended in substate play.\n\nBechen has never scored that many points in any other season \u2013 mainly because he didn\u2019t need to. He put up 113 as a freshman, 399 as a sophomore and 532 as a junior. Since Bechen averages just over 30 points per game, he can hit the 800-point mark \u2013 but North Linn will most likely need to make it to the state championship game for it to happen.\n\nThe Lynx \u2013 the reigning state champions in Class 1A \u2013 enter this year\u2019s tournament as the No. 5 seed. So, it won\u2019t be an easy road to the final. But Bechen is capable of getting to 800 and if he does, he\u2019ll be the first Iowa boys basketball player to do so since Norwalk\u2019s Bowen Born scored 983 total points in his senior season in 2020.\n\nMore: 10 of the top recruits at the 2025 Iowa high school boys state basketball tournament\n\nWill Jaidyn Coon be enough for Storm Lake to make a run in Class 3A?\n\nStorm Lake boasts one of the best players in the country, based on recruiting rankings. Coon \u2013 a four-star propsect, according to 247Sports Composite \u2013 holds seven Division I offers and is the No. 103 player nationwide.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 small forward made a statement this season, averaging 24.2 points, nine rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.6 blocks per game. So yeah, he is a major reason why Storm Lake is in the state tournament.\n\nAnd the Tornadoes will need Coon to play some of his best basketball if they want to make it past teams like undefeated Clear Lake, undefeated Knoxville or sneaky No. 3-seed Ballard.\n\nBut one look at Storm Lake\u2019s statistics showed that this is a balanced team, even with a little star power on the roster. Cam Boyd also averages in the double digits (14.8) and the Tornadoes seem to encourage team rebounding, with four players averaging four or more boards per game.\n\nCoon is a good basketball player and will, no doubt, be a large part of Storm Lake\u2019s success at state. But if the Tornadoes want to win, it will come down to the team and not just one player.\n\nWhich team has the best upset potential in Class 2A?\n\nThe Register picked West Lyon to beat Western Christian in our pre-tournament predictions, so for the sake of not repeating ourselves, we\u2019re not going to talk about the No. 1 and 2 seeds much in this section.\n\nThe easy answer is No. 3-seeded Unity Christian. The Knights' four losses were by two points or less \u2013 and they all came against tournament teams. MOC-Floyd Valley \u2013 the No. 6 seed in Class 3A \u2013 beat Unity Christian 64-63. West Lyon defeated the Knights twice, 71-69 and 71-70. Western Christian escaped with a 73-72 win against Unity Christian.\n\nUnity Christian showed in the regular season that it can play tough teams close. So don\u2019t be surprised if the Knights try to get revenge for those almost-wins in the state tournament.\n\nBut if you think picking the No. 3 seed is a bit of a cop out, we think the most realistic lower seed to upset would be No. 6 Grundy Center. The Spartans beat two other tournament teams \u2013 Jesup and Union \u2013 in the regular season, but they did lose to Grand View Christian by 10 points.\n\nStill, isn\u2019t winning championships in Grundy Center's DNA? And with the winning pedigree on this roster, don\u2019t be surprised if the Spartans make some waves next week.\n\nCan Linn-Mar make it through its bracket to, possibly face Cedar Falls, in the final?\n\nThe Lions are the only team left standing \u2013 in Class 4A \u2013 that beat Cedar Falls in the regular season. The Tigers defeated Linn-Mar handily, 61-34, in their second game of the year. But the Lions responded with a 69-61 victory on their home court. There are many reasons why Linn-Mar is the No. 2 seed in the bracket, but the Lions\u2019 win against Cedar Falls must have played a big part.\n\nLinn-Mar doesn\u2019t have an easy path to the title game. The Lions will need to beat Waukee in the quarterfinal \u2013 a rematch of Linn-Mar's 68-60 victory over the Warriors on Dec. 7. Get through that game and the Lions will face either Valley, the reigning champion, or Ames, which could battle its way into the championship. Make it through that, and Linn-Mar could get a chance at upsetting Cedar Falls.\n\nAlyssa Hertel is the college sports recruiting reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Saturday's matinee at Wells Fargo starts at 12:30 p.m. EST.\n\nThe game will be nationally broadcasted on ABC/ESPN+. The radio broadcast is on 97.5 The Fanatic with an online simulcast on Flyers Radio 24/7.\n\nThis is the second and final meeting of the 2024-25 season series between the teams. At Climate Pledge Arena on October 17, the Kraken beat the Flyers by a 6-4 score. Jared McCann collected a goal and two assists for Seattle, while Scott Laughton had a pair of goals and an assist for the Flyers.\n\nSaturday's game is the third match of a seven-game homestand for the Flyers. The Flyers are 0-2-0 thus far after going 4-0-1 over their five previous games. The Kraken, playing the second game of a five-game homestand, have also lost both of their last two games.\n\nHere are the RAV4 Things to watch on Saturday plus an x-factor heading into the game.\n\n1. Life after Laughts\n\nThe Flyers locker room atmosphere is going to be different for some time. Laughton, who was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday, was a galvanizing presence for his now-former team: universally respected by the other players and appreciated for how he went the extra mile (on or off the ice) for every one of his colleagues.\n\nIn addition to the Laughton trade, the Flyers dealt Andrei Kuzmenko (acquired in the January 31st exchange that sent Joel Farabee and Morgan Frost to the Calgary Flames) and veteran defenseman Erik Johnson at the deadline. Hockey is a business, but bonds run deep within the locker room, especially with homegrown players who had spent their entire careers with the Flyers.\n\nThere were emotional goodbyes after the well-liked Farabee and Frost were traded, and even more so when leadership group mainstay Laughton (a member of the organization since the 2012 Draft) goes to another team. The immediate challenge for the Flyers who remain is to focus on the game at hand on Saturday against Seattle.\n\n2. Couturier and Sanheim\n\nThe two Flyers players with the most seniority in the organization are team captain Sean Couturier (2011 Draft) and veteran defenseman Travis Sanheim (2014 Draft). Both are already key players on the club on a day-in and day-out basis. Now, it is even more important that they lead by example as the club moves on following the Laughton trade.\n\nCouturier's line with Owen Tippett and Matvei Michkov has played well since the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament break. Couturier (10 goals, 20 assists, 30 points) has five points in six games since the break, including a pair of goals.\n\nSanheim (27 points) has averaged a career-high 24:25 of ice time this season. Last Saturday, he logged 27:47 in the Flyers' upset road win against the Winnipeg Jets.\n\n3. Opportunities for callup players\n\nThe Flyers made several recalls from the AHL's Lehigh Valley Phantoms after Friday's series of trades. Defenseman Emil Andrae (24 NHL games played this season), center Rodrigo Abols (nine games with the Flyes) and winger Olle Lycksell (six games) have all been called up with the intention of having them on the NHL roster for the rest of the season.\n\nAbols will step into the lineup spot vacated by Laughton. Lycksell will take over Kuzmenko's role, including a projected opportunity to see power play time with the NHL club. Johnson's departure opened an NHL roster spot for Andrae to return. In terms of playing time, Andrae will compete with the likes of Egor Zamula for a spot in the starting lineup.\n\n4. Between the pipes\n\nWith the Flyers playing three games in four days, including back-to-back matinees on Saturday against the Kraken and Sunday against New Jersey, the Flyers will split the goaltending duties. Samuel Ersson started on Thursday in a 4-1 loss to Winnipeg.\n\nOver the weekend, Ivan Fedotov will get one game and Ersson will get the other. There is no morning skate on Saturday and, as of this writing, the starter against Seattle has not yet been confirmed. However, it is notable that Fedotov has played very well in each of his last two appearances.\n\nX-Factor: New linemates for TK\n\nFlyers leading scorer Travis Konecny (63 points in 63 games) had been playing on a line with Laughton and Kuzmenko on either side of the 4 Nations Face-Off. Theirs was the one line in the top nine of the rotation that was not fully in sync in terms of being a connected trio. The Couturier line and the combination of Noah Cates centering Tyson Foerster and Bobby Brink have had some very productive games.\n\nWith the trades that sent Laughton to Toronto and Kuzmenko to the LA Kings, Konecny will have two new linemates come gametime against Seattle. In terms of his individual play, Konecny has been enduring his first slump of the season. He had a tough evening against Winnipeg on Thursday, and has five points (1g, 4a) in his last 12 games.",

Enjoy Italian at Le Virt\u00f9, refined French at Townsend, pizza with a twist at Pizzata Pizzeria & Birreria, and craft beverage flights from The Bottle Shop.\"\n\nMarian Anderson Museum reopens\n\nPhiladelphia is home to some of the country's most historic museums, and now, after years of repairs, the National Marian Anderson Museum and Historical Society is making its return to the public.\n\nThe museum was once the house of the famed opera singer and civil rights activist Marian Anderson. Now, it's a historic landmark to honor her legacy. In 2020, the museum flooded after a water pipe burst, forcing the museum to temporarily shut its doors.\n\nPriceless artifacts have since been repaired and restored, thanks to countless supporters. Amongst the treasures are a collection of elegant gowns that belonged to Anderson and a vintage gramophone record player that stands near her piano.\n\nExplore the artifacts that await during its \"Marian: The Philadelphia Story\" exhibit, which lasts through November 2025.\n\nKraken vs. Flyers\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers return to the ice Saturday after dropping their last two games by three points each. They will host the Seattle Kraken, who come into the game with a 26-33-4 record.\n\nThe Flyers are looking to secure a few wins, with them being in the midst of a seven-game homestand.\n\nThe action begins Saturday at 12:30 p.m. Tickets start at $40.\n\nFirewolves vs. Wings\n\nThe Philadelphia Wings take on the Albany Firewolves during prime time Saturday at 7 p.m. in South Philly. The Wings look to snap a four-game losing streak against the team that beat them by five goals in their last meeting.\n\nThe Wings are also excited to welcome New Jersey's own The Early November for a lively halftime performance. The band's set will headline \"An Emo Evening,\" the team's annual theme night that encourages fans to embrace their inner emo and enjoy classic pop-punk music.\n\nWe are all a little Emo, see you at Emo Evening Volume III featuring @theearlynov this Satuday at 7:00PM\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f: https://t.co/8KhEqodvmn pic.twitter.com/I7HbuQaBkZ \u2014 Philadelphia Wings (@NLLwings) March 3, 2025\n\nThe performance stage will be located in the Wings' New Trail Party Zone at turf level. The Party Zone is a general admission section, and each ticket includes three beverages. Tickets start at $20.\n\nDevils vs. Flyers\n\nIf the Sixers' recent misfortune wasn't a big enough thorn in Philly fans' sides, Josh Harris' New Jersey Devils are in the midst of a playoff push. The Flyers look to add another loss to the Devils column Sunday afternoon. To the delight of many fans, the 33-24-6 Devils have lost three of their last four games.\n\nTickets for the 1 p.m. game start at $76.\n\nJazz vs. 76ers\n\nHours after the Flyers' matchup against the Devils, the 76ers will take on the Utah Jazz at 7:30 p.m.\n\nFollowing the news of Joel Embiid being sidelined for the rest of the season, the injury bug made its way to the rest of the Sixers' stars. Tyrese Maxey is dealing with a back injury, and Paul George recently sustained a groin injury.\n\nThe Utah Jazz, with a 15-47 record, are one of the few teams with a record worse than the Sixers.\n\nTickets for the game start at a wallet-friendly $10.",

            "content": "Shares of the bank stocks JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.22%) and Wells Fargo (WFC 3.49%) fell 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, for no obvious reason but likely due to new economic data and ongoing tariff news that seems to change daily.\n\nJobs report misses estimates\n\nNew jobs data from February once again missed economist estimates and pointed to further weakness in the economy. Nonfarm payrolls in the U.S. added 151,000 jobs last month, 9,000 less than expected. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1% when economists had expected 4%, and average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from the prior month, in line with expectations. Furthermore, the number of jobs added in January were revised down by 18,000 to 125,000.\n\nBanks are cyclical, so investors tend to get concerned when they see weakness in the economy because it can result in higher loan losses, and also lead to a decrease in lending activity if businesses don't grow and consumer spending declines.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump continues to go back and forth on tariffs, a cycle that has seemingly exhausted investors. Trump on Tuesday implemented sweeping 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. On Wednesday, he exempted goods covered under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) until April 2. Today, Trump floated the idea of tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy goods. Trump also threatened tariffs and new sanctions on Russia as he seeks further progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nLarge banks are exposed to the broader economy\n\nLarge banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have relationships with consumers and businesses in nearly every sector of the economy, so if investors get worried about the economy or the impact of tariffs on economic growth, the sector is likely to take a hit.\n\nLonger term, however, I certainly don't hate the set up for banks. The sector faces a much friendlier regulatory environment under Trump, and hopefully, the yield curve continues to steepen, which is when bank profits tend to perform best. While I don't think you should sell JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, I see better opportunities in the small- and mid-cap space where valuations are more attractive and where mergers and acquisitions activity could pick up as the year progresses.",

Wells Fargo & Co (Symbol: WFC) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.\n\nBut making Wells Fargo & Co an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of WFC entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $69.25 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Wells Fargo & Co, the RSI reading has hit 27.5 \u2014 by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 43.7. A falling stock price \u2014 all else being equal \u2014 creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, WFC's recent annualized dividend of 1.6/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.20% based upon the recent $72.65 share price.\n\nA bullish investor could look at WFC's 27.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on WFC is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.\n\nClick here to find out what 9 other oversold dividend stocks you need to know about \u00bb\n\nAlso see:\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Executives relentlessly pressured employees to meet extreme sales quotas, leading them to create millions of fraudulent accounts without clients\u2019 consent.\n\nAs these fake accounts grew, the CEO of Wells Fargo at the time, John Stumpf, raked in bigger and bigger bonuses. After the scandal blew up, regulators hit Stumpf with fines totalling $20 million \u2014 only a small dent in the estimated $130 million he walked away with in compensation when he resigned.\n\nThis is just one of countless stories of CEOs taking reckless actions to pump up their own paychecks while putting their employees and the general public at risk. We\u2019ve seen the same pattern behind the opioid crisis, the 2008 financial crash, the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and more. But it\u2019s the story I know best.\n\nI started my career at Wells Fargo over 22 years ago \u2014 first as a teller, then as a branch manager, and later as an investigator in the department that handles misconduct allegations.\n\nI would like to be able to say that things changed after the accounts scandal. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo\u2019s current CEO, Charles Scharf, continues to cut corners in ways that put customers at risk.\n\nLast year, we found out about a plan to cut costs by outsourcing jobs from our investigations department to India, where, in an ironic twist, we reviewed human rights complaints from Wells Fargo employees forced to stay at work even after falling ill. We were concerned not only about losing our jobs but about how this might put our clients\u2019 private information at risk \u2014 a particular concern for our many active-duty military clients.\n\nWells Fargo has also gutted their risk and complaint departments. They use shortcuts to create the illusion of fewer complaints, but in reality they are closing many cases prematurely rather than properly investigating. And, believe it or not, clients are still filing complaints about unauthorized accounts.\n\nLike Stumpf, Charles Scharf appears to also see his job as a way to further maximize short-term profits to benefit top executives and wealthy shareholders. While slashing thousands of U.S. jobs, Scharf received a compensation package in 2024 worth a staggering $31.2 million.\n\nUnder Scharf\u2019s leadership, Wells Fargo also spent over $73 billion on stock buybacks between 2019 and 2023. This is a financial maneuver that artificially inflates executives\u2019 stock-based pay while siphoning resources from worker pay or improving services.\n\nMy department decided to form a union last year so we would have more power to improve Wells Fargo\u2019s practices. But the bank is still unlawfully refusing to recognize or bargain with our union.\n\nIt\u2019s time for our political leaders to step up and do something about a CEO pay system that rewards executives with obscenely large paychecks for practices that harm workers and the broader economy.\n\nThe current tax debate offers a good opportunity. Republicans are calling for even more corporate tax breaks, which, based on past experience, will make the rich richer but do nothing for ordinary working people.\n\nInstead, Congress should pass bills that have been introduced to tax corporations with huge gaps between their CEO and worker pay and to increase an existing tax on stock buybacks. These bills would encourage companies to focus on long-term prosperity and stability rather than simply making wealthy executives and shareholders even richer.\n\nIn the meantime, Wells Fargo employees will continue to fight to unionize so they can do their part to make the bank better for the rest of us \u2014 the workers, customers, and the communities it serves.\n\nThe current tax debate offers a good opportunity.

            "content": "It's time to step to the sidelines on MongoDB after its latest earnings report suggested a disappointing outlook for the stock, according to Wells Fargo. Analyst Andrew Nowinski downgraded the database software maker to equal weight from overweight, and lowered his price target, after MongoDB issued weaker-than-expected full-year guidance because of slow growth in its Atlas cloud-based database service. MongoDB forecast adjusted earnings per share of $2.44 to $2.62 and revenue of $2.24 billion to $2.28 billion for fiscal 2026, implying a revenue growth rate of 12.7% that is the slowest for the company going back to its public debut in 2017. MDB YTD mountain MongoDB \"With a smaller pool of multi-year deals, we believe it will be difficult to significantly outperform expectations in FY26 and therefore expect shares to remain range-bound,\" he wrote MongoDB did beat expectations on the top and bottom lines in its latest report, posting adjusted earnings per share of $1.28, while analysts polled by LSEG expected a profit of 66 cents per share. Revenue of $548.4 million also exceeded the expected $519.6 million. Nevertheless, the analyst's $225 price target, cut sharply from $365 previously, implies more than 14% downside from Wednesday's close of $264.13. The stock is down more than 18% already in the Thursday premarket. MongoDB has plunged over the past 12 months, down about 35%, while outperforming in 2025, up more than 13%. Still, the analyst said he expects Atlas core consumption trends will eventually stabilize, while contributions from generative artificial intelligence will also tick up again. \u2014 Jordan Novet contributed to this report.",

In a filing on Tuesday, the CFPB announced the dismissal of the case \u201cwith prejudice.\" The agency under the Trump administration has dropped other Biden-era cases in a similar manner and agreed to not pursue them again, making it unlikely that victims will see their funds recovered, former CFPB head of enforcement Eric Halperin told CNBC.\n\nLindsey Johnson, president of the Consumers Bankers Association, said in a statement that \"banks have consistently followed the law in offering services through Zelle.\"\n\n\u201cIn a time when fraud and scam activity is surging ... we look forward to moving past finger-pointing and political grandstanding and instead working constructively with policymakers to counter the root causes of these threats,\" Johnson said.\n\nOriginally launched as an alternative to PayPal and Venmo, Zelle has quickly become one of the most popular payment apps, facilitating over $1 trillion in transactions.\n\nThe CFPB's lawsuit said not all of those were legitimate, and customers of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo who use Zelle lost a collective $870 million on the platform over the last seven years. When fraud victims reached out for assistance, the banks were largely unhelpful, the CFPB alleged; in some cases, victims were told to simply ask for their money back from the scammers.\n\nThe decision to drop the case comes as the CFPB, now led by White House budget director Russell Vought, has dropped multiple enforcement actions and faces internal upheaval over mass firings.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against other best holding company stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Treasury Yield Market\n\nThe treasury yield has been moving towards its lowest point in a month following a comment from the Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson. The secretary suggested that the new administration is focused on the 10-year treasury and its yield, rather than the Fed cutting interest rates. On February 6, Ed Mills, Managing Director at Raymond James, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on the market amid new economic, political, and tax policies.\n\nMills reiterated a very important factor raised in the Secretary\u2019s speech the day before, suggesting that the Trump tax cuts from 2017 were to be made permanent, adding $4 trillion to debt and deficit over the coming 10 years. He added that the policies also desire to cut tips and social security taxes, now bringing the total debt and deficit to $5 trillion. Mills suggested that the debt and deficit were so huge that it would be extremely challenging for the government to keep the \u201clong end of the curve down.\u201d\n\nWhy Value Investing is the Way to Go\n\nIn another interview on March 5 on Yahoo Finance, Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman at TIGER 21, shared his market thesis amid changing macroeconomic and political trends. He shared that while turmoil and confusion are encapsulating the market, his clients remain very strong, emphasizing his inclination towards value investing. He also added that his members are finding significant value in private equity and the private real estate industry.\n\nHe suggested that while a lot of indicators in the market point towards a possible rotation from growth into value, he remains cautious about the changing conditions, reiterating that it is currently very challenging to find value in the market environment. Sonnenfeldt added that focusing on the fundamentals of equities is of crucial importance at the moment, rather than company momentum, amid volatile economic and political conditions. He shed light on his member\u2019s buying strategy, which happens to be entirely focused on the basics of a stock, emphasizing that others should follow suit.\n\nWhile some stocks pose a risk due to the current market conditions, some stocks, especially those with strong fundamentals and long-standing businesses, offer greater protection and certainty.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 14 best holding company stocks to buy right now, we went over similar rankings on the internet and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment around every stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge funds, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) ranks seventh on our list of the best holding company stocks to buy right now. The financial services company provides a wide range of financial services to all types of customers. Some of its services include bank accounts, loans, mortgages, investment management, and other banking services. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company generated $20.4 billion in revenue and $5.08 billion in net income. An impressive feat was that the company saw an 11% increase in non-interest income due to improved results from its venture capital investments. Similarly, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) also saw a 12% decline in non-interest expense. Its wealth and investment management segment posted record results, increasing revenue by 8%.\n\nOn January 20, Glenn Thum, an analyst at Phillip Securities, maintained a buy rating on Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) with a price target of $85. He maintained a buy rating on the stock because of the company\u2019s sound financial performance and strategic initiatives. The company reported solid earnings in the fourth quarter of 2024, largely meeting expectations. In addition to that, Thum highlighted that the company increased its dividend by 14% year-over-year and delivered shareholder value. The company maintains a positive outlook for 2025, expecting significant growth in net interest income. Similarly, on January 16, Bank of America Securities assigned a buy rating to the stock with a price target of $86.\n\nOverall, WFC ranks 7th on our list of best holding company stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of WFC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WFC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

That\u2019s not just unfair to ordinary workers or taxpayers \u2014 it\u2019s dangerous for our entire economy.\n\nI\u2019ve seen firsthand how these CEO pay practices incentivize the very worst kinds of corporate misbehavior.\n\nRemember the 2016 \u201cphony accounts\u201d scandal at Wells Fargo? Executives relentlessly pressured employees to meet extreme sales quotas, leading them to create millions of fraudulent accounts without clients\u2019 consent.\n\nAs these fake accounts grew, the CEO of Wells Fargo at the time, John Stumpf, raked in bigger and bigger bonuses. After the scandal blew up, regulators hit Stumpf with fines totalling $20 million \u2014 only a small dent in the estimated $130 million he walked away with in compensation when he resigned.\n\nThis is just one of countless stories of CEOs taking reckless actions to pump up their own paychecks while putting their employees and the general public at risk. We\u2019ve seen the same pattern behind the opioid crisis, the 2008 financial crash, the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and more. But it\u2019s the story I know best.\n\nI started my career at Wells Fargo over 22 years ago \u2014 first as a teller, then as a branch manager, and later as an investigator in the department that handles misconduct allegations.\n\nI would like to be able to say that things changed after the accounts scandal. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo\u2019s current CEO, Charles Scharf, continues to cut corners in ways that put customers at risk.\n\nLast year, we found out about a plan to cut costs by outsourcing jobs from our investigations department to India, where, in an ironic twist, we reviewed human rights complaints from Wells Fargo employees forced to stay at work even after falling ill. We were concerned not only about losing our jobs but about how this might put our clients\u2019 private information at risk \u2014 a particular concern for our many active-duty military clients.",

The latest announcement brings the total workforce reductions in the Des Moines metro to 1,044 since April 2022, according to the WARN website, with 342 in 2024.\n\nIt was the first Des Moines metro layoff the company has announced this year, though a layoff announced in December, of 21 workers, took effect in February.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. When past layoffs have occurred, Wells Fargo has stated that company leaders \u201cregularly review and adjust staffing levels to align with market conditions and the needs of our businesses.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo also has consistently stated that it works to find opportunities for affected employees in other parts of the company and provides assistance such as severance pay and career counseling if other jobs are not available.\n\nThe Wells Fargo website on Wednesday listed 46 job openings in Des Moines and West Des Moines.\n\nWells Fargo job cuts also happening in Oregon\n\nIn July, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in an earnings call with analysts that the bank's head count had been declining for 16 consecutive quarters. The San Francisco-based bank has cut a total of more than 11,000 jobs this year companywide, second-quarter data show.\n\nThe Des Moines metro is not the only place where Wells Fargo job cuts have been occurring. The company announced it will be closing centers located in Hillsboro and Salem, Oregon, affecting more than 700 workers, according to the Oregon WARN site.\n\nThe latest Des Moines metro layoff notices did not indicate in which divisions of the company was reducing jobs, and it has declined to comment when asked in past layoffs. The bank\u2019s home mortgage division, heavily concentrated in the Des Moines metro, has throttled back amid higher interest rates and lower demand.\n\nWells Fargo's Des Moines metro employment peaked 14,500 in 2017, but it has since fallen to what the Greater Des Moines Partnership says is \u201cmore than 11,000.\u201d That's eclipsed by the 12,000-plus of the Hy-Vee supermarket chain, which has its headquarters in West Des Moines.\n\nThe bank has steadily shifted most of its metro workforce to Jordan Creek, largely emptying buildings in other locations, including downtown Des Moines. It was expected to close on the sale of its four downtown office Des Moines buildings, with more than 850,000 square feet of floorspace as well as a parking ramp, to an undisclosed buyer in January, city records show. So far, however, there has been no transfer of the title.\n\nKevin Baskins covers jobs and the economy for the Des Moines Register. Reach him at kbaskins@registermedia.com.",

See our best credit cards page for other options.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card has a somewhat hidden identity. At first, it may seem like a fairly pedestrian rewards card, whose earnings capabilities start out strong but flame out in half a year. But a closer look shows that it offers big potential for anyone seeking exceptional redemption values on airfare.\n\nIn other words, what you miss out on in earning, you may be able to make up for in \"burning.\"\n\nHere are five things to know about the card.\n\n1. You'll get killer rewards ... for 6 months\n\nThe $0-annual-fee Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card doesn't offer a traditional upfront sign-up bonus after meeting a minimum spending requirement. But it does earn 5X points on up to $12,500 in combined spending on gas, grocery and drugstore purchases for the first six months of card ownership. All non-bonus-category purchases earn 1X back. That's a pretty stellar rate in multiple everyday spending areas \u2014 but it doesn't last.\n\nAfter the first six months or once you reach that spending cap, whichever comes first, the card drops down to earning just 1 point back per $1 spent. That's below the flat-rate industry standard of 1.5% back on everything, and there's no way to boost it again. You're stuck at that rate for as long as you hold the card.\n\nIt's also worth noting that points expire after five years \u2014 a long time, to be sure, but many credit cards offer rewards that never expire. If you want a card with more long-lasting rewards, explore our best credit card offers page.\n\nTravel Rewards Expert Reveals... Why this is her top credit card for dining rewards, and she shows you exactly how she realizes more than $1,000 in value from it each year. Click for details\n\n2. Rewards are worth 50% more when used to book airfare via Wells Fargo\n\nWhere this card truly shines is its redemption rate. Typically, Wells Fargo rewards points are worth a penny each no matter how they're redeemed, meaning that if you were to max out the card's spending cap in the first six months, you'd snag at least $625 back. Not bad at all.\n\nBut the Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card is unique among the issuer's portfolio of cards, in that its points take on 50% more value when you redeem for plane tickets. For example, 20,000 points can be redeemed through the Go Far Rewards portal for $300 worth of airfare. That's a fantastic rate of 1.5 cents per point \u2014 especially for a card with an annual fee of $0.\n\nAnd if you happen to be a really big spender, the redemption rate gets even better: Put $50,000 or more on the card in one year, and points are then worth 1.75 cents each when redeemed for airfare through Wells Fargo.\n\n3. You can pool your earnings from other cards\n\nBetter yet, if you have other Wells Fargo cards that earn Go Far Rewards, you can move those earnings to your Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card and enjoy the higher redemption rate on airfare.\n\n4. It comes with cell phone protection\n\nThe Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card provides cell phone insurance for devices that have been damaged or stolen, as long as you pay your monthly phone bill with the card. The amount you'll get reimbursed is limited to the repair or replacement of your original phone, less a $25 deductible, with a maximum benefit of $600 per claim and $1,200 per 12-month period.\n\n5. You'll have access to Visa Signature perks\n\nThe Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card also carries some plush extras courtesy of its Visa Signature status including:\n\nPrice protection (an increasingly rare perk on a credit card).\n\nAuto rental collision coverage.\n\nTravel accident insurance.\n\nExtended warranty protection.\n\nHotel benefits through the Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection.",

            "content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is dropping its lawsuit against the company that runs the Zelle payment platform and three U.S. banks as federal agencies continue to pull back on previous enforcement actions now that President Donald Trump is back in office.\n\nIn December a federal regulator sued JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, claiming the banks failed to protect hundreds of thousands of consumers from rampant fraud on Zelle, in violation of consumer financial laws.\n\nIn the federal civil complaint, the CFPB asserted that the banks rushed to get the peer-to-peer payments platform to market without effective safeguards against fraud and then, after consumers complained about being defrauded on the service, largely denied them relief.\n\nEarly Warning Services, a fintech company based in Scottsdale, Arizona, that operates Zelle, was named as a defendant in the lawsuit. EWS is owned by seven U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Those three banks are the largest financial institutions on the Zelle network, accounting for 73% of activity on Zelle in 2023.\n\nBut a filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on Tuesday indicated that the CFPB was dismissing its lawsuit against EWS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo with prejudice.\n\nThe dismissal comes less than a week after the CFPB dropped several enforcement actions against companies like Capital One and Rocket Homes.\n\nIn notices of voluntary dismissals that were filed, the CFPB dropped lawsuits it had brought against Capital One, Rocket Homes, Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, owned by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, and others.\n\nThose suits were all filed under the agency\u2019s previous director, Rohit Chopra, who Trump fired just weeks ago. The CPFB has since plunged into turmoil \u2014 with the White House later ordering it to halt nearly all its work. The administration also closed the agency\u2019s headquarters and moved to fire scores of its workers.\n\nTrump has defended his administration\u2019s broadside against the CFPB \u2014 including recent claims about the agency being \u201cset up to destroy people.\u201d But supporters of the agency stress that it provides crucial oversight and protects consumers from being vulnerable to predatory business practices.\n\nThe CPFB isn\u2019t the only federal agency to signal a pullback on previous enforcement action under the new administration. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has either closed or paused legal action against several cryptocurrency platforms in recent weeks, as the regulator tries to present itself as more crypto-friendly under Trump.\n\nLast month Binance and the SEC filed a joint motion to pause its high-profile lawsuit against the crypto exchange. The SEC filed a similar joint motion with Coinbase. In addition, Robinhood has said that the case against it has been closed.",

The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 1.12%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 1.14%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.46%.\n\nThe biggest U.S. mortgage lender's shares have seen a decrease of 7.76% over the last month, not keeping up with the Finance sector's loss of 1.89% and the S&P 500's loss of 4.13%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Wells Fargo in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.24, down 1.59% from the prior-year quarter. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $20.89 billion, reflecting a 0.14% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $5.87 per share and a revenue of $85.17 billion, indicating changes of +9.31% and +3.5%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Wells Fargo. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.65% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Wells Fargo is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Wells Fargo is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 12.48. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.26.\n\nIt is also worth noting that WFC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.1. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial - Investment Bank industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.08 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Financial - Investment Bank industry is part of the Finance sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 3, positioning it in the top 2% of all 250+ industries.",

            "content": "The fact that multiple Wells Fargo & Company ( ) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo\n\nThe insider, Ather Williams, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$63.70 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$73.30. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 27% of Ather Williams's stake.\n\nIn the last year Wells Fargo insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Wells Fargo insiders own about US$282m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nIt doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Wells Fargo shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Wells Fargo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, and understanding it should be part of your investment process.\n\nOf course Wells Fargo may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.

Fargo. It holds the distinction of operating under the very first national bank charter granted in the U.S.\n\nHeadquartered in San Francisco, Wells Fargo offers a wide range of banking and financial services, operates in 22 countries, has 68 million customers, and more than 5,600 retail branches.\n\nWells Fargo reported a net income of $19.7 billion and revenue of $82.3 billion at the end of its 2024 fiscal year. The company's return-on-asset (ROA) ratio was 1.03% and its return-on-equity (ROE) ratio was 11.4% for the same period.\n\nThe company has a market cap of $253.3 billion as of March 3, 2025, and domestic assets of $1.7 trillion as of Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nThe main competitors of Wells Fargo are three of the other four major U.S. banks\u2014JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. These four banks serve the majority of personal and commercial accounts in the United States.\n\nThe world's largest bank is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nMarket Capitalization (as of March 3, 2025): $728.7 billion\n\nDomestic Assets (as of Dec. 31, 2024): $2.7 trillion\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) as we know it today was formed through the merger of JP Morgan Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank in 2000. It is the largest bank in the United States by market capitalization and total assets held in the country and is among the top 5 banks in the world by total assets.\n\nHeadquartered in New York, the bank operates across the entire spectrum of banking and financial services in more than 100 countries.\n\nServices include asset management, corporate and investment banking, consumer and community banking, and commercial banking. The bank has engaged in many mergers and acquisitions (M&A) including Bank One, the Bank of Chicago, and Bear Stearns.\n\nThe company reported net income of $58.5 billion and non-interest revenue of $85 billion for the 2024 fiscal year. Its ROA ratio was 1.43% and its ROE ratio was 18% for the same period.\n\nBank of America\n\nMarket Capitalization (as of March 3, 2025): $346.5 billion\n\nDomestic Assets (as of Dec. 31, 2024): $2.4 trillion\n\nBank of America Corporation (BAC) is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, but has a vast retail banking presence with more than 3,700 retail operations, serving 69 million consumer and business accounts.\n\nIt is the second-largest bank in the United States by total assets. It achieved its current size through a series of mergers and acquisitions, including NationsBank in 1998\u2014the biggest bank merger at that time\u2014and Fleet Boston Financial.\n\nBank of America's 2008 acquisition of Merrill Lynch transformed it into one of the largest investment banking operations worldwide, boosting it to one of the largest wealth management companies in the world.\n\nFor 2024, Bank of America reported revenue of $101.9 billion and a net income of $27.1 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2024, Bank of America's full-year ROA was 0.83%, while its ROE was 9.53%.\n\nCitigroup\n\nMarket Capitalization (as of March 3, 2025): $145.4 billion\n\nDomestic Assets (as of Dec. 31, 2024): $1.1 trillion\n\nLike its peers, Citigroup (C) is a multinational banking and financial services company. Headquartered in New York, the bank was formed through one of the largest mergers in history, that of Citicorp and the financial services firm, Travelers Group.\n\nBefore the Great Recession, Citigroup was ranked as the largest company and the largest bank worldwide, but the company suffered massive losses during the financial crisis, dropping down to the last position among the big four.\n\nFor the 2024 fiscal year, Citigroup reported a net income of $12.7 billion on revenue of $81.1 billion. Citigroup's ROA was 0.51% and its ROE was 6.1% for the full year of 2024.\n\nWhat Are the Three Main Types of Banks in the U.S.? In regard to the types of banks where customers can make deposits, there are three primary types of financial institutions. These include commercial banks, thrifts/savings and loans, and credit unions. Each of these has different specialties and is better suited for specific needs; however, the distinction between them has become blurred over time and many provide the same offerings.\n\nAre Banks and Financial Institutions the Same? Not exactly. Banks are financial institutions but not all financial institutions are banks. Financial institutions encompass any entity that provides financial services. These include traditional banks, investment funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and private equity firms. So a bank is one kind of financial institution among many.\n\nHow Safe Is the U.S. Banking System? The U.S. banking system is considered to be extremely safe given the stability of the U.S. economy, the strict regulation of the system, the oversight of the Federal Reserve, and the deposit insurance of $250,000 for each deposit account provided by the FDIC. While the banking system is generally stable, it is not without issues, as seen during the financial crisis and other bank collapses and liquidity crises.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWells Fargo is one of the largest financial institutions in the U.S., playing a significant role in banking and other financial services. In terms of total assets, it ranks as the third-largest bank in the U.S., behind only JPMorgan and Bank of America.\n\nWells Fargo has a long history, a global presence, a large customer base, and a broad range of offerings keeping it competitive in the banking landscape.",

The agency is now embroiled in a legal battle after a union representing CFPB employees sued to halt mass firings and the purging of data that would've happened under Vought and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe CFPB said customers of the three banks have lost more than $870 million since the launch of Zelle in 2017. The service was started to provide bank customers an alternative to peer-to-peer platforms including PayPal . Last year Zelle crossed $1 trillion in total volume, which it said was the most ever for a peer-to-peer platform.\n\nSince the recent cases were dismissed with prejudice, the CFPB has agreed to never bring these claims again, shutting off the possibility of clawing back funds for consumer relief, former head of enforcement Eric Halperin told CNBC last week.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Zelle brand said they welcomed the dismissal and reiterated an assertion that the CFPB lawsuit was \"legally and factually flawed.\"\n\nA JPMorgan spokeswoman said that while \"banks play a crucial role in scam prevention and consumer education.... this is a national security problem that requires a collective effort across the public and private sectors.\"\n\n\"Banks have consistently followed the law in offering services through Zelle,\" Lindsey Johnson, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement after the dismissal. \"In a time when fraud and scam activity is surging ... we look forward to moving past finger-pointing and political grandstanding and instead working constructively with policymakers to counter the root causes of these threats.\"",

            "content": "Listen to the article 8 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nBank of America and Wells Fargo, like a number of other banks in recent weeks, have backed away from diversity, equity and inclusion mentions in their annual filings last week.\n\nWhere the \u201cDiversity and Inclusion\u201d section in Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America\u2019s 10-K was last year is instead a section in this year\u2019s filing titled \u201cTalent, Inclusion and Opportunity.\u201d It refers to the bank\u2019s approach to recruiting, hiring, employee networks and training and development, without mentioning diversity, equity or inclusion.\n\nA table breaking down workforce demographics \u2013 called \u201cDiversity Metrics\u201d in last year\u2019s filing \u2013 is referred to as \u201cWorkforce data\u201d in this year\u2019s. This year\u2019s filing does break out the share of U.S.-based employees identifying as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific, or \u201cTwo or More Races.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s filing mentioned a \u201cdiversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives and policies,\u201d and noted the bank\u2019s \u201cGlobal Diversity and Inclusion Council, which has been in place for over 20 years, is chaired by our CEO and consists of senior executives from every line of business and region.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mention of that council or the diversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives or policies in this year\u2019s filing. A person familiar with the matter said the council is being renamed the \u201cGlobal Opportunity and Inclusion Council.\u201d BofA is also swapping out the \u201cdiversity\u201d in a \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d internal human resources group name, in favor of \u201copportunity and inclusion,\u201d the person said.\n\nAdditionally, the bank will no longer have aspirational DEI-related goals or require a diverse slate of candidates for open roles. Those changes at the bank, which is a government contractor, were driven by the Trump administration\u2019s DEI executive order, the person said. Those changes mirror similar moves at Citi, announced by CEO Jane Fraser on Feb. 20.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan was asked last week whether the bank has a DEI policy, amid recent backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives due to the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown, but the CEO didn\u2019t answer the question directly.\n\n\u201cWe have diversity and inclusion at our company,\u201d he responded at an event at The Economic Club in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut, step back: we\u2019ve always been the bank of opportunity.\u201d\n\nMoynihan\u2019s \u201copportunity\u201d mention aligns with new wording used in this year\u2019s 10-K, which forgoes diversity and inclusion mentions but asserts \u201cBank of America has always been the bank of opportunity for our shareholders, our clients and customers, our communities and our teammates.\u201d\n\nThe bank, in last year\u2019s filing, said it \u201c[reinforces] our commitment to diversity and inclusion by investing internally in our employee networks and by facilitating voluntary enterprise-wide learning and conversations about various diversity and inclusion topics. In addition, we have practices in place for attracting diverse talent, including campus recruitment.\u201d\n\nThat language is absent from this year\u2019s filing. A Bank of America spokesperson said the bank\u2019s annual report, proxy and its website provide far more detail on the bank\u2019s programs.\n\nThe BofA spokesperson also pointed to a mention in this year\u2019s filing that the bank is \u201cdeliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their career goals.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo, too, has cut a \u201cPromoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d paragraph from this year\u2019s annual filing, as well as any mention of an annual pay equity review.\n\nThat review \u2013 which the bank had conducted with a third-party consultant \u201cfor a number of years,\u201d according to last year\u2019s filing \u2013 compared compensation of women to men globally, and U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities, \u201ctaking into account factors such as role, level, tenure, and geography.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more critically, the bank is dropping a 2022 policy that required that 50% or more of that job candidates interviewed for certain roles be diverse.\n\n\u201cIn light of the current environment, we have decided to discontinue the diverse slate guidelines,\u201d Wells Fargo said Feb. 26 in a memo seen by Bloomberg. \u201cWe remain focused on maintaining a workplace where we hire the best and most qualified people and one where everyone has equal access to opportunities to grow.\u201d\n\nThe policy had a rocky start, as roughly dozen of Wells\u2019 then-current and former employees alleged, in a New York Times report, that the bank held phony job interviews for nonwhite and female job-seekers for positions that had already been offered to other candidates. Wells Fargo paused its policy for several weeks to review and update it. The initial iteration called for a 50% diverse slate for jobs that paid $100,000 a year or more.\n\nWells Fargo asserted last week that it would continue to \u201csource a broad pool of candidates\u201d when recruiting.\n\nAlthough championing diversity and inclusion is no longer listed as an expectation for every employee, Wells added this line to this year\u2019s filing: \u201cWe want to be recognized as a great company for everyone by maintaining recruitment and career development practices that support our employees and provide an environment that welcomes people from different backgrounds and with different experiences.\u201d\n\nWells maintained its demographic breakdown in this year\u2019s filing: As of the end of 2024, \u201cour global workforce was 51% female and 49% male, and our U.S. workforce was 54% female and 46% male. Our U.S. workforce was 51% white, 48% racially/ethnically diverse, and 1% undeclared,\u201d this year\u2019s filing said.\n\nTruist\n\nTruist, in its latest annual filing, referred to a table breaking down workforce demographics as \u201cTeammate Composition\u201d rather than \u201cTeammate Diversity.\u201d\n\nIn last year\u2019s 10-K filing, the bank, under a section called \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\u201d said \u201cinclusivity, belonging, and authenticity are at the core of Truist\u2019s evolving culture,\u201d and \u201cDEI continues to play an instrumental role across this evolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruist\u2019s longstanding commitment to DEI thoughtfully positions the organization to lead and execute inclusively,\u201d the bank said last year.\n\nThis year, Truist said it \u201caspires to foster a performance-based culture that is reinforced by belonging and inclusivity. Furthering a sense of belonging drives our teammate mission of creating an inclusive and energizing environment that empowers teammates to learn, grow, and have meaningful careers.\u201d\n\nTruist, Wells and Bank of America join JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Capital One and U.S. Bank among lenders that have de-emphasized mentions of DEI in annual regulatory filings made over the past few weeks.",

            "content": "Many of the largest banks in the U.S. are getting hammered today, as economic concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs and economic growth continue to impact the broader market.\n\nShares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM 3.22%), the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, traded nearly 5% lower as of 10:52 a.m. ET. Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC 3.49%) traded 6.5% lower at that time, while shares of Citigroup (C 2.31%) were down 7.5%.\n\nFirst-quarter GDP estimates crater\n\nBy now, investors know that market conditions under Trump can change at lightning speed. Weakening consumer sentiment and a ratcheted-up trade war in recent weeks have resulted in a marketwide sell-off that has only accelerated.\n\nThe latest sign of weak economic growth came from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Yesterday, the bank's GDPNow model projected first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) to decline 2.8%. A week ago, GDPNow called for 2.3% growth, and a month ago, the model projected 4% growth. These are some of the fastest downward revisions since the pandemic.\n\nOne of the culprits behind the big move could be the Trump administration's tariffs, which have gone from a negotiating tactic into a full-blown trade war. Twenty-five percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada went into effect today, along with increased tariffs on goods from China. Retaliatory tariffs are expected to follow.\n\nTariffs serve as a tax on foreign imports and are meant to make American businesses more competitive. However, they may also lead to higher consumer prices and can harm economic growth. The Brookings Institute last month estimated that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as retaliatory tariffs by each country, could lower real GDP growth by $75 billion in the U.S. Banks are cyclical, so they tend to be impacted by the economy and consumer sentiment, which makes up over two-thirds of GDP.\n\nIn company-specific news, more reports are emerging about manual errors on bank transfers made at Citigroup, a core part of regulatory issues the bank has been dealing with in recent years. Last Friday, The Financial Times reported that Citigroup accidentally sent a client an $81 trillion payment by accident when it intended to only send $280. The incident happened last April and the payment was eventually reversed. Yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Citigroup's wealth management division almost transferred $6 billion to a client's account.\n\nThe reports are concerning because regulators slapped Citigroup with a consent order in 2020, along with a $400 million fine for the bank's failure to correct long-standing internal and risk controls. The order is believed to have been at least partially triggered by Citigroup accidentally wiring $900 million to creditors of the company Revlon in 2020. Last July, regulators once again hit Citigroup with a $136 million fine for taking too long to fix matters related to the 2020 consent order.\n\nUncertainty at an all-time high\n\nHeading into the year, I really liked the setup for bank stocks due to deregulation and a steepening yield curve in which shorter-duration Treasury notes yield less than longer-dated ones. However, banks are certainly not immune to a recession and large banks had been on a nice run. I'm still optimistic long term on the outlook for bank stocks, but there may be more opportunity right now in the small- and mid-cap space where merger and acquisition activity could heat up later this year.",

The company\u2019s failure to meet the weight-loss target with CagriSema caused a huge setback. Intense rivalry in the obesity sector also threatens its market share. Patent expiry and pricing pressure across the diabetes market remain a woe.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Novo Nordisk beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates. Its diabetes drugs Ozempic and Rybelsus and obesity drug Wegovy are performing well, fueled by increasing demand. Label expansions of the same in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales.\n\n\n\nIt has been tackling the supply constraints of Wegovy by making serious investments to ramp up production. It is now indicated in the United States and the EU to also reduce heart risks, which is a huge boost.

The company\u2019s efforts to strengthen risk management and compliance infrastructure continue to be the mainstay of its operational strategy, as seen by the resolution of ten regulatory consent orders since 2019.\n\n\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s progress on efficiency initiatives, such as branch and footprint reduction, will support expense reduction and drive bottom-line growth. A decent deposit balance is likely to support its financials.\n\n\n\nYet, its loan growth is expected to be limited, as the asset cap remains in place until it complies fully with regulators\u2019 demands regarding operational risk management. This, along with lower origination, is expected to hurt mortgage banking income in the near term. Yet, its decent liquidity position will keep the capital distribution move sustainable in the long term.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here >>>)\n\n\n\nStar Group\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry over the past year (+26.6% vs. -44.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $451.79 million have seen first-quarter net income surged $19.9 million year over year to $32.9 million, driven by a $24.3 million favorable derivative movement, offsetting revenue declines and higher taxes.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA rose $2.8 million to $51.9 million, supported by acquisitions and margin expansion. Home heating oil and propane volumes grew 2.8% to 82.4 million gallons due to colder weather and acquisitions. Service and installation revenues rose 11.4% year over year to $88.6 million, enhancing stability.\n\n\n\nHowever, revenues fell 7.6% to $488.1 million as lower selling prices offset volume gains. The base business volume declined 4.7%, signaling organic weakness. Customer attrition hit 4.3%, with lower gross gains. Operating expenses rose 5.3% due to acquisitions, pressuring margins.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nWells Fargo has dropped its goal of pursuing net-zero financed emissions across its portfolio by 2050, becoming the latest bank to revise its sustainability strategy as the ESG sector faces increased scrutiny.\n\nThe San Francisco, California-based bank shared in an update Friday that it was scrapping the net-zero financed emissions goal, as well as discontinuing 2030 sector-specific targets on financed emissions. The latter focused on carbon-intensive sectors such as oil and gas, power, aviation, steel and automotive production.\n\nWells Fargo said it would continue \u201cproviding financing and expertise to help clients pursue their own objectives\u201d and \u2014 despite abandoning its targets for financed emissions \u2014 maintain other sustainability goals it previously committed to, including one to achieve net-zero emissions across its own operations by 2050. The bank will also maintain a pair of goals that aim to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWells Fargo said it would maintain its goal of deploying $500 billion in sustainable finance by 2030 and has provided $178 billion in sustainable finance activities between 2021 to 2023 towards that goal. The financing includes $16 billion directed toward renewable energy and over $15 billion that has been allocated to clean transportation.\n\nThe bank also said it would continue to uphold operational sustainability targets it had set for the end of the decade, including a goal to cut scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 70% and to reduce energy, waste stream and water usage by 50%, 50% and 45%, respectively \u2014 all compared to 2019 baselines. Additionally, the bank said it aims to meet all of its annual purchased electricity consumption needs with renewable energy sources.\n\nThe bank set both its financed emissions targets in 2021 to support the clean energy and low-carbon transition. At the time, Wells Fargo CEO and President Charles Scharf said \u201cclimate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and Wells Fargo is committed to aligning our activities to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and to helping transition to a net zero carbon economy.\u201d\n\nHowever, when Wells Fargo scrapped both financed emissions targets last week, it said achieving the goals was contingent on \u201cmany factors outside [its] control.\u201d These included public policy, consumer attitudes, and technology shifts that would allow its clients to \u201cmove quickly to lower-emitting operating models,\u201d the bank reported.\n\n\u201cMany of the conditions necessary to facilitate our clients\u2019 transitions have not occurred,\u201d the bank said in its Feb. 28 update.\n\n\u200b\u200bWells Fargo\u2019s updated sustainability strategy comes almost two months after it exited the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a sector coalition whose members committed to aligning their financial activities with the aim of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Wells Fargo\u2019s exit was preceded by Goldman Sachs\u2019 departure from NZBA and was followed by a wave of departures from other U.S. banks. Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase all followed Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo out the door.\n\nThe departures came only a few weeks before President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Since returning to the White House, Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders that have signaled a reversal on the nation\u2019s federal climate policy. These included orders to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, again; declare a national \u201cenergy emergency;\u201d pause all wind power development; and suspend all funding disbursements related to the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nThe Wells Fargo update also came shortly after rival bank HSBC announced it was pushing back a target to achieve net-zero emissions across its own operations and supply chains by 20 years. The U.K. based bank said it had \u201crevisited [its] ambition\u201d and was now delaying its goal of hitting net-zero in its operations, business travel and supply chain from 2030 to 2050.",

Over the same year, you'd earn $320 in interest. That's a staggering difference.\n\nLooking further ahead:\n\nAfter 5 years , you'd have earned just $4 in a Wells Fargo account versus $1,734 in the high-yield savings account.\n\n, you'd have earned just in a Wells Fargo account versus in the high-yield savings account. After 10 years, it would be $8 at Wells Fargo compared to $3,842 in the high-yield savings account.\n\nHow to switch to a high-yield savings account in an hour or less\n\nMany people stick with their current bank because switching seems like a hassle. But opening a new high-yield savings account is surprisingly quick and easy. Here's what you need to do:\n\nFind a high-yield savings account -- Look for an account with an APY of at least 3.70% and no fees. Open your new account -- Most banks offer a simple application process that takes just a few minutes. Transfer your savings -- Move your money from Wells Fargo to your new high-yield savings account. This should only take a couple of minutes. Update automatic deposits and withdrawals -- Ensure that any direct deposits or bill payments tied to your old account are updated. Close your old account -- If you no longer need it, close your Wells Fargo savings account. Wells Fargo accounts charge monthly fees if you don't maintain a minimum balance or make regular deposits.\n\nThe process should take about an hour. That's a small time investment for the chance to earn thousands of dollars more over the years.\n\nClick here to see our list of the best high-yield savings accounts and open a new account today.\n\nAre there any downsides to switching?\n\nSome people prefer big banks like Wells Fargo because they have thousands of physical branches. If you regularly deposit or withdraw large amounts of cash, having access to a branch might be useful.\n\nMost high-yield savings accounts are offered by online-only banks. While they may not have brick-and-mortar locations, they still offer full FDIC protection, meaning your deposits are just as safe as they would be at Wells Fargo. Plus, they typically offer better mobile banking features and no-fee ATM withdrawals from a linked checking account.\n\nIf you need access to cash, you can always transfer money from your high-yield savings account to a checking account at a traditional bank. Just keep in mind that these transfers can take a couple of business days.\n\nDon't let your savings sit idle\n\nIf your money is sitting in a Wells Fargo savings account, you're likely earning next to nothing in interest. Taking an hour to switch to a high-yield savings account could mean earning hundreds of dollars more per year -- and thousands over time.\n\nI made the switch to SoFi\u00ae and started earning way more in interest -- it's quick, easy, and completely worth it.

            "content": "Valued at a market cap of $257.5 billion, San Francisco, California-based Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) is a leading financial services firm offering banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products. It operates through its four segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management.\n\nCompanies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as \u201cmega-cap stocks,\u201d and Wells Fargo fits the criterion perfectly. WFC is a multinational financial services firm and one of the \"Big Four Banks\" in the U.S., serving over 70 million customers in 35 countries. Known for its vast branch network and being the first major U.S. bank to unionize successfully, it stands out for its cross-selling strategy and diverse financial services.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nThe biggest U.S. mortgage lender dropped 3.9% from its 52-week high of $81.50, recorded on Feb. 6, 2025. Over the past three months, its shares have gained 1.4%, outperforming the broader Dow Jones Industrials Average's ($DOWI) nearly 2% decline during the same period.\n\nIn the longer term, WFC has gained 11.5% on a YTD basis, outperforming DOWI\u2019s 3.1% rise. Over the last 52 weeks, Wells Fargo & Company shares have climbed 43.1%, compared to the Dow Jones\u2019 12.6% return in the same period.\n\nWFC has been trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since October last year.\n\nShares of Wells Fargo rose 6.7% on Jan. 15 after reporting Q4 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.42, beating the consensus. Investor sentiment improved due to an 11% increase in non-interest income to $8.5 billion, driven by higher asset-based fees, investment banking revenue, and venture capital gains. The company\u2019s efficiency ratio improved to 68%, reflecting better cost management, while non-interest expenses declined 12% to $13.9 billion. Additionally, Wells Fargo repurchased 57.8 million shares.\n\nIn comparison, rival Bank of America Corporation (BAC) also lagged behind WFC. Shares of BAC gained 34.4% over the past 52 weeks and 4.9% on a YTD basis.\n\nDespite WFC\u2019s strong price action over the past year, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about its prospects. Among the 25 analysts covering the stock, there is a consensus rating of \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and it is currently trading below the mean price target of $84.08.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

The new target represents a 13% premium to where the stock is trading as I write this and is a sign that the worst might be over for the housing-improvement market.\n\nA recovery in progress\n\nRecent results from Home Depot and rival Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) gave cause for optimism that growth is returning. Lowe's comparable sales increased by 0.2% in its fourth quarter, and management expects comparable sales to be flat to up 1% for the full year.\n\nTurning back to Home Depot, its comparable sales were up 0.8% in the fourth quarter, with comparable transactions up 0.6% and its comparable average ticket price up 0.2%. In concert with Lowe's, Home Depot's management expects 1% comparable sales growth in 2025.\n\nWhile these numbers sound anemic, the market is looking for a turning point that could lead to a sustained upturn. The Wells Fargo analyst acknowledges there are headwinds, and the exact time the recovery will kick in is unclear, but Home Depot is a fundamentally strong business. Moreover, the housing recovery will occur at some stage, even if it's largely due to easier comparisons with prior years.\n\nIs Home Depot a stock to buy?\n\nThe \"buying the housing recovery\" thesis makes sense, but it's hard to think that Home Depot -- a stock that trades at 26 times Wall Street's estimates for 2025 earnings -- is the best way to get exposure to it on a risk-reward basis.\n\nIt's a relatively low-risk way to play the idea and a relatively low-reward way. It may suit more conservative investors looking to play the theme. Still, plenty of other housing-related stocks (including many that distribute through Home Depot) are on much lower valuations with significantly more upside if you are bullish on housing. With the timing and strength of the housing recovery still an ongoing debate, it's hard to get too excited about Home Depot.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Home Depot right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Home Depot wasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against the other undervalued wide moat stocks.\n\nAs per BlackRock, European equity gains have managed to outpace the US to start 2025. Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we used a screener and sifted through several media reports to choose companies having an economic moat and that analysts see upside to. Next, we filtered out the ones that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 28.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~12.2%\n\nForward P/E as of February 28: ~13.5x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a financial services company, which provides diversified banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services. The financial services giant enjoys a wide economic moat, stemming from the cost advantages and switching costs. Furthermore, its extensive branch network and healthy market position offer a solid foundation for growth. The focus on efficiency and cost-cutting initiatives resulted in improving operational performance, placing it well to capitalize on economic recovery.\n\nAnalyst Glenn Thum from Phillip Securities maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock, providing a price target of $85.00. The rating is backed by a combination of factors, such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\u2019s financial performance and strategic initiatives. As per the analyst, the outlook for 2025 is positive, with expected growth in NII due to loan expansion and reduced market funding costs, together with further decrease in expenses. Such factors, along with the continued increase in non-interest income, mainly in investment banking and trading activities, support the rating.\n\nElsewhere, Bank of America Securities also gave a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\u2019s stock with a price objective of $86.00. For FY 2025, the company expects net interest income to be ~1% \u2013 3% higher than in 2024 and non-interest expense of ~$54.2 billion. Oakmark Funds, advised by Harris Associates, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) was the top contributor during the quarter. The U.S.-headquartered diversified bank\u2019s stock price rose after reporting what we see as solid third-quarter earnings where the company\u2019s efficiency ratio continued to improve as expenses were well controlled. The fee income segment also performed well, growing 12%. In addition, Wells Fargo had the opportunity to repurchase $3.5 billion in shares during the period, bringing the full-year repurchase to roughly $16 billion. In November, the stock price continued its upward trend following the U.S. presidential election as investors are optimistic that the financials sector will benefit from looser regulations and lower corporate taxes, thus stimulating a better environment for dealmaking. We continue to believe that Wells Fargo is a competitively advantaged bank that can use its superior business mix and return potential to unlock further value.\u201d\n\nOverall WFC ranks 11th on our list of the undervalued wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of WFC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than WFC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, on Thursday, shared his thoughts on the market\u2019s volatility following President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcements and provided insights into which sectors and stocks could weather the impact of these new trade policies.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Thoughts on 8 Stocks As He Discussed Market Froth and Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 10 Stocks\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is out there fighting inflation every day except not the way we want him to do it. He\u2019s fighting inflation, not in the mall, not in the supermarket, but in the stock market.\n\nHe pointed out that Trump is attempting to reduce prices in the market by gradually bringing down stock values, noting that if the current trend continues, we may eventually see stock prices return to pre-COVID levels.\n\nCramer also identified stocks he believes could be relatively insulated from the negative effects of these tariffs. He emphasized that these are the companies whose values are not directly impacted by the primary reason many stocks are struggling, tariffs. The protected stocks, according to Cramer, can maintain their worth even if additional tariffs are imposed on other countries. Cramer\u2019s list was aimed at those seeking stability in an uncertain market environment, where the next country to be hit with tariffs remains unclear. He went on to say:\n\n\u201cStarting with tech first. Nothing that can be sold to China has a chance to get out of this thing unscathed. Nothing that has parts made in Taiwan can hold its value. Nothing that\u2019s crafted in China can stay up. If we can\u2019t be sure where the next tariff is gonna land, we can\u2019t own these stocks until they go lower and then we can.\u201d\n\nTurning to the transportation sector, Cramer was blunt in his assessment. He pointed out that transportation stocks are closely tied to global commerce, which in turn is directly affected by tariffs. With tariffs raising the cost of goods, Cramer argued, global trade will slow, which will negatively impact businesses across the board. He highlighted the general economic principle that raising prices leads to reduced sales, making the transportation sector vulnerable to these market shifts. When it came to the auto industry, Cramer described the situation as a tough one.",

Well, let\u2019s make this insecurity worse: imagine that not only is your card blocked, but your account has been blocked without warning. Horror! This is what many Wells Fargo customers have experienced, a real nightmare\n\nWhat is Wells Fargo?\n\nOne of the largest, most reliable and oldest banks in the United States. When it was created in 1852, its objective was to offer service in the Wild West, but it soon became one of the most basic pillars for Americans.\n\nAnd what happened?\n\nThis bank has been in the spotlight after a citizen of Cuban descent saw his account frozen with all his savings inside. The reason? Compliance with federal regulations requiring verification of the immigration status of account holders, so no, it has not happened with all Well Frango clients, but only with those whose immigration status was not entirely clear, although many affected people claim that their documents were in order and that there was no notification before this blockage occurred.\n\nBut why are bank accounts being closed?\n\nThe bank has explained that the blockages are entirely related to OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations), which require more verifications and especially for those clients who may have ties to countries sanctioned by the United States.\n\nSo, this means that people who were born in countries that have restrictions by the USA may be in this situation, even if they are naturalized US citizens.\n\nWhat have customers done?\n\nThey have obviously reported that they have been involved in a process that is not transparent for them and that is, some users have spent more than two weeks without access to their money! Without being able to pay bills, mortgages or other obligations they had.\n\nWhat cases have been reported so far?\n\nThere have been several cases that have been reported, the two most well-known have been of two Cuban citizens, one of whom discovered that his card was blocked when he went to pay in an establishment on January 29 and could not pay.\n\nThe other is the most famous so far, in this case, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Orta, spent 17 days without being able to access his money and without having been previously notified! Imagine believing that like every month, all your direct debits are paid and that these payments are not made because your accounts are blocked.\n\nThe bank claims that it did send a notification to these users prior to the blockages because they are \u201ccommitted to offering transparency to their clients\u201d but the reality is that none of the reported cases had any idea that their accounts were going to be frozen.\n\nThey also assure that as soon as all the required information is collected, they will solve the problem and everything will be as if nothing had happened.\n\nHow can I avoid having my account frozen?\n\nWhether you are a Wells Fargo customer or a customer of another entity that has similar policies, you can take 4 actions to prevent this from happening to you!",

This is the highest flat cash-rewards rate available among Wells Fargo credit cards, and it can certainly add up to great earnings on your spending. The cash-rewards program is straightforward, so you don't have to worry about tracking bonus categories or activatin g each quarter. Plus, new cardholders of the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card can currently earn a $200 cash rewards welcome bonus when they spend $500 in purchases in their first three months from account opening. This card provides a 0% intro APR for 12 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers (after that, a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR applies) so that you can finance a large buy or have more time to pay off your credit card debt without accruing additional interest. Balance transfers made within the first 120 days qualify for an intro transfer fee of 3% of the amount transferred, after that, a 5% fee of the amount you transfer applies ($5 minimum). [ Return to summary ]\n\nWells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card\n\nWith the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card, you can transfer the rewards you earn to all of Wells Fargo's travel partners. This redemption option is rare to find with a no-annual-fee travel card. It's also a top choice for earning rewards in popular spending categories. It earns 3X points for spending in the following categories: Travel\n\nRestaurants\n\nGas\n\nTransit\n\nSelect streaming services\n\nPhone plans All purchases outside of these categories earn 1X points, but a big chunk of an average budget will earn triple points. Outside of the ability to transfer points, each point is usually worth one cent a piece and you can redeem them for gift cards, statement credits and more. Cardholders can also take advantage of cell phone insurance, Roadside Dispatch\u00ae and rental car collision coverage. [ Return to summary ]\n\nWells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card\n\nThe Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card offers new cardholders one of the longest intro 0% APRs on the market: 21 months 0% APR intro period on new purchases and qualifying balance transfers from account opening (then 17.24%, 23.74% or 28.99% variable APR). That gives cardholders nearly two years to chip away at their debt without incurring interest charges. That means more of your payments go toward your debt, versus debt plus interest on a card without a 0% APR period. To qualify for the intro balance transfer period, you need to complete any transfers within 120 days from account opening, BT fee of 5%, min: $5. This no annual fee card doesn't offer any rewards, but it does offer cell phone protection up to $600 when you pay your monthly cell phone bill with the card. Claims will have a $25 deductible. Cardholders can also access My Wells Fargo Deals, an opt-in cash back program for specific retailers, giving cardholders discounts on purchases made with their Reflect card. [ Return to summary ]\n\nBilt Mastercard\n\nThe Bilt Mastercard allows you to pay rent with your credit card and earn rewards without paying any fees. The card also earns 3X points on dining, 2X points on travel and 1X point on other purchases. You just need to use the card 5 times each statement period to earn points, including rent. Not only is this card the best option for paying rent, but you can also redeem Bilt points in various valuable ways. You can use Bilt points in all sorts of ways including, paying for travel through the Bilt app, redeeming them toward a down payment on a house and transferring your points to partner travel programs such as Alaska Airlines, Hyatt and Emirates. Bilt's monthly Rent Day promotions can be extremely valuable, in the past there have been transfer bonuses of up to 150% to partners such as Emirates, Flying Blue and IHG. The Bilt card has no annual fee (see terms), but is still loaded with insurance benefits. Eligible purchases qualify for trip delay reimbursement*, trip interruption/cancellation insurance*, cellular protection* and auto rental collision damage waiver*. *Please review the Bilt Mastercard\u00ae Guide to Benefits for details.

Every credit card review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of credit card products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best Wells Fargo credit cards.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which credit cards offer the best value, CNBC Select analyzed Wells Fargo credit cards available in the U.S. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards, welcome bonus, introductory and standard APR, balance transfer fee and foreign transaction fees, as well as factors such as required credit and customer reviews when available. We also considered additional perks, the application process and how easy it is for the consumer to redeem points. Select teamed up with location intelligence firm Esri. The company's data development team provided the most up-to-date and comprehensive consumer spending data based on the 2019 Consumer Expenditure Surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can read more about their methodology here. Esri's data team created a sample annual budget of approximately $22,126 in retail spending. The budget includes six main categories: groceries ($5,174), gas ($2,218), dining out ($3,675), travel ($2,244), utilities ($4,862) and general purchases ($3,953). General purchases include items such as housekeeping supplies, clothing, personal care products, prescription drugs and vitamins, and other vehicle expenses. Select used this budget to estimate how much the average consumer would save over a year, two years and five years, assuming they would attempt to maximize their rewards potential by earning all welcome bonuses offered and using the card for all applicable purchases. All rewards total estimations are net the annual fee. While the five-year estimates we've included are derived from a budget similar to the average American's spending, you may earn a higher or lower return depending on your shopping habits.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy Before Spring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against the other stocks to buy before spring.\n\nSeasonality in the Stock Market\n\nSeasonality is simply a historical average of how the stock market performs over the course of the year. March has traditionally been a good month for equities, with prices rising more frequently than not and yielding a positive return on average. Furthermore, the first three months of spring often result in robust advances across all indexes. On the other side, because September is often a weak month for equities, a trader who generally takes long positions may choose to take the month off or sell their holdings earlier than normal if they begin to decrease during September.\n\nNaturally, there are a number of investing strategies based on seasonal trends. \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d is one such well-known financial aphorism that refers to a stock investment strategy based on the notion that the stock market underperforms during the six months of May to October. Historical facts have usually confirmed this adage throughout the years, particularly after 1945. Furthermore, the S&P 500 generates positive returns around two-thirds of the time from May to October, increasing to 77% from November to April.\n\nSome possibilities surrounding this phenomenon include increased Christmas purchasing, holiday-fueled optimism, and investors settling their accounts before leaving for vacation. While growth is somewhat slow in February and March, the stock market often rises in April owing to the expected publication of first-quarter reports. In contrast, the period from May to October is often less positive, with first-quarter earnings having already been released and many investors spending less time paying attention to equities while on vacation.\n\nSectors Outperforming in Spring\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Ilan Benhamou expects that, given the backdrop of worsening economic indicators, the US stock market would plateau in early March before recovering later in the Spring. He stated:\n\n\u201cIn the short term, the situation is too chaotic, and the stock market will struggle to break through. I believe the market is stagnating. With liquidity improving, macro uncertainties easing, profits continuing to show resilience in USA businesses, losses stopping, and retail investors buying in again, I believe that in the medium term, the S&P 500 Index will rise and yields will decline.\u201d\n\nKnowing this, more than just select companies, investors would probably be more interested in knowing what sectors of the market outperform the others during the Spring season. Thankfully, CNBC already did the heavy lifting a while back. CNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.\n\nIn 2024, financial stocks outperformed the market, surpassing all other sectors. Financial markets surged sharply and widely following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This spike was mostly driven by market confidence about a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025. Furthermore, Spring generally results in higher consumer spending as people receive tax refunds and engage in activities like home buying. This rise in spending may lead to increased loan demand and transaction volumes for banks and financial institutions.\n\nSeasonal demand has a substantial impact on energy sector performance as well. One clear explanation for good spring performance is the seasonal availability of renewable energy producing sources. Toward the end of 2024, energy sector equities had significant volatility, gaining by more than 6% in November before falling over 10% in December. The broader market\u2019s energy sector closed 2024 with a return of only 5.72%. Despite trailing the market last year, Spring may bring better fortune, as refineries ramp up gasoline output to match the expected increase in travel during the warmer months. This can lead to increased crude oil prices, which will boost the performance of energy equities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the best spring stocks, we selected some of the best financial services and energy firms with the most hedge fund investors in Q4 2024, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), founded in 1852, is a notable financial services company that offers a wide variety of banking, investing, mortgage, consumer, and commercial financing products and services.\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported revenues of $20.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, a slight 0.5% decrease from the same quarter the prior year. However, net income increased dramatically to $5.07 billion, up from $3.4 billion the year before.\n\nOn January 16, RBC Capital Markets raised its price target for Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) to $80 from $72, while keeping a Sector Perform rating on the bank\u2019s shares, citing Wells Fargo\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings. RBC Capital also upgraded Wells Fargo\u2019s EPS predictions, increasing the 2025 estimate to $5.85 from $5.50 and the 2026 expectation to $6.75 from $6.45. This adjustment includes projected greater net interest revenue and solid noninterest income, as well as lower expenditures, however a higher provision for credit losses is expected to partially offset these benefits.\n\nOverall WFC ranks 5th on our list of the best stocks to buy before spring. While we acknowledge the potential of WFC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WFC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Wright, a former fracking executive, has slammed what he characterizes as the \u201caggressive pursuit\u201d of net zero which he says has delivered no benefits, but \u201ctremendous costs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s part of a steady barrage of Republican attacks on climate policies that banks in the world\u2019s largest economy had embraced less than half a decade ago. In 2021, Wells Fargo chief executive, Charlie Scharf, called climate change \u201cone of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the bank said its earlier ambitions ended up being out of step with reality.\n\n\u201cWhen we set our financed emissions goal and targets, we said that achieving them was dependent on many factors outside our control,\u201d Wells Fargo said. It\u2019s now clear that \u201cmany of the conditions necessary to facilitate our clients\u2019 transitions have not occurred.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes just months after Wells Fargo quit the world\u2019s biggest climate coalition for banks \u2014 the Net-Zero Banking Alliance \u2014 together with the rest of its US peers. That exodus started one month after the Nov. 5 election returned Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nClimate experts warn the development will ultimately inject more risk into the finance industry.\n\n\u201cThis kind of repudiation is just doubling down on taking on more transition risk,\u201d said David Carlin, the former head of risk at the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and the founder of D.A. Carlin and Company. \u201cIt makes it harder to effectively help clients cope with a changing world and it just feels like a plan to dismantle the work they had already done in preparing for the transition.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo says a single bank can\u2019t deliver net zero emissions if the economy it serves is on a different trajectory. It\u2019s a line that a growing number of financial firms have started repeating. Most recently, the new chief sustainability officer of HSBC Holdings Plc, Julian Wentzel, said it\u2019s time to stop penalizing fossil-fuel clients and acknowledge that energy security is now a top priority.",

You can also check out our list of best credit cards for alternative options. The Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card can help you save on credit card interest charges thanks to its top-tier intro-APR offer on purchases and balance transfers. But before you can take advantage of this card's money-saving features, you'll need to get approved for it. Below, CNBC Select uncovers the credit score requirement for the Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card.\n\nWells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card Learn More On Wells Fargo's site Rewards None\n\nWelcome bonus None\n\nAnnual fee $0\n\nIntro APR 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers.\n\nRegular APR 17.24%, 23.74%, or 28.99% variable APR\n\nBalance transfer fee 5%, min: $5\n\nForeign transaction fee 3%\n\nCredit needed Excellent/Good See rates and fees, terms apply. Pros Best-in-class intro-APR for purchases and qualifying balance transfers\n\nNo annual fee\n\nCell phone insurance Cons No rewards\n\nNo welcome bonus\n\nHigh balance transfer fee Learn More View More\n\nWells Fargo Reflect Card details\n\nWith a new Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card, you'll receive an amazing 21 months of 0% intro APR from the date the account is opened on purchases and balance transfers. A variable APR of 17.24%, 23.74% or 28.99% will apply once the intro APR ends. For balance transfers, there is a balance transfer fee of 5%, min: $5. You'll also have access to other perks, such as roadside dispatch and cell phone protection. The cell phone coverage provides up to $600 per claim against theft or damage ($25 deductible; maximum two claims every 12 months). While the Reflect Card doesn't earn rewards, if you have credit card debt or need to finance a big purchase, what you can potentially save on interest can outweigh the lack of rewards. The average credit card APR is around 23% (for accounts accessed interest). If you have a $10,000 credit card balance you plan on paying over 21 months, this card's intro APR would save you over $2,200 in interest. Keep in mind, that the balance transfer fee would be $500 and reduce your savings to around $1,700.\n\nCredit score needed for the Wells Fargo Reflect Card\n\nWells Fargo doesn't officially publish a credit score requirement for the Reflect Card. However, you'll usually need at least a good to excellent score to have the best approval odds. There are a few different credit scoring models, including VantageScore and FICO\u00ae Score. Both scores range from 300 to 850 and are based on your credit reports from the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. The range for a credit score varies depending on the specific scoring model and it is typically based on the following factors: Payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, new credit and credit mix. Credit scores are typically categorized from very poor to excellent. As an example, FICO Scores fall into the following categories: Very poor: 300 to 579\n\n300 to 579 Fair: 580 to 669\n\n580 to 669 Good: 670 to 739\n\n670 to 739 Very good: 740 to 799\n\n740 to 799 Excellent: 800 to 850\n\nWhat to do if you aren't approved for the Wells Fargo Reflect Card\n\nThe Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card requires a healthy credit score and unfortunately, most of the best intro-APR cards and balance transfer cards also have higher credit score requirements. If you need to improve your credit, you may want to consider opening a secured credit card. These cards require an upfront deposit but tend to have high approval rates. Alternative credit card to consider The Discover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card doesn't have an intro-APR offer, but makes up for it with generous rewards, especially for an easy-to-get secured credit card. It earns 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter, after that, you'll earn 1% cash back on those purchases. All other purchases earn 1% cash back. It also has a potentially valuable welcome offer. Discover will match all the cash back you earn in the first year.\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Secured Credit Card Learn More Discover cards are currently not available on CNBC Select.

The most important habit to develop is to pay your bills on time and in full. This will improve your payment history and keep the amounts you owe low, which are two key factors in determining your credit score. If you need a quick bump for your credit score, there are tools that may help. Services such as *Experian Boost\u00ae and eCredable Lift\u00ae allow you to add additional activity to your credit report that normally wouldn't be included. This information can include utility provider payments and payments to streaming services.\n\nExperian Boost\u00ae Learn More Cost Free\n\nAverage credit score increase 13 points, though results vary\n\nCredit report affected Experian\u00ae\n\nCredit scoring model used FICO\u00ae Score Results will vary.

Experian Boost only impacts your Experian credit report and eCredable Lift only changes what's on your TransUnion report. It's also important to know that eCredable Lift adds positive and negative activity to your credit report. So, adding negative payment information to your account could lower your credit score. Find the best credit card for you by reviewing offers in our credit card marketplace or get personalized offers via CardMatch\u2122.\n\nCompare savings accounts\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card stands out for offering a generous intro APR of no interest on purchases and balance transfers for 21 months. However, it normally requires a good to excellent credit score, so it can be more difficult to get. If you're unable to qualify for this card, consider a credit card for bad credit, which can help you build your credit history or improve your credit score if you pay it on time and in full.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!

            "content": "Israel Englander, the driving force behind Millennium, has built a reputation as one of the most successful hedge fund managers in modern finance. A graduate of New York University, Englander pursued an MBA before leaving early to trade at AMEX, where he gained valuable experience in market-making and derivatives trading. His expertise and strategic vision enabled Millennium to grow rapidly, managing approximately $13 billion in assets by 2011. In recent years, Englander has explored opportunities to sell a minority stake in the firm, signaling a shift towards institutional ownership. His approach to hedge fund management prioritizes capital allocation to specialized teams rather than making direct investment decisions himself. This model has allowed Millennium to maintain a highly competitive edge, attracting top talent and fostering a dynamic investment environment.\n\nMillennium was co-founded by Israel A. Englander and Ronald Shear, both of whom had extensive experience in the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). The firm initially launched with $35 million in capital, with Englander contributing $5 million and securing additional investment from Canadian financiers, the Belzberg brothers. However, the firm faced early struggles, leading to Shear\u2019s departure just six months after its inception. Despite these challenges, Millennium Management evolved into a powerhouse in the hedge fund industry, consistently ranking among the top-performing firms. Over the years, Millennium has adopted an institutionalized structure, attracting seasoned executives such as Bobby Jain, who served as co-CIO alongside Englander until his departure in 2023. By implementing a disciplined risk management framework and continuously refining its investment strategies, Millennium has remained at the forefront of alternative asset management.\n\nMillennium Management is a globally recognized investment firm specializing in multi-strategy hedge fund offerings. Founded in 1989, the firm has established itself as one of the largest alternative asset management firms. With headquarters in New York, Millennium Management has expanded its operations across North America, Europe, and Asia, with 18 primary offices in financial hubs such as London, Dubai, Singapore, and Tokyo. The firm employs a platform-based investment approach, consisting of approximately 330 investment teams operating under a decentralized model. These teams deploy diverse strategies across various asset classes, including equities, fixed income, commodities, and derivatives. Millennium\u2019s core strategies encompass fundamental equity research, equity arbitrage, macroeconomic-driven fixed-income investments, and commodity-based trades. By leveraging a data-driven and diversified approach, the firm seeks to generate consistent, high-quality returns for its investors while effectively managing risk across global markets.\n\nWe recently published a list of Israel Englander\u2019s Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Invest in . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against other stocks to invest in from Israel Englander\u2019s portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMillennium\u2019s outstanding performance has positioned it as one of the most successful hedge funds globally. As of Q4 2024, the firm reported $204.64 billion in managed 13F securities, with its top ten holdings comprising 15.5% of its portfolio. Notably, Millennium has consistently ranked among the highest-grossing hedge funds, posting the fourth-largest net gains of any fund since its inception.

Net income rose 47% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, or $1.43 per share, while revenue reached $20.4 billion. Growth was fueled by a 59% surge in investment banking fees, driven by increased deal-making activity as companies took advantage of improved economic confidence to raise capital and pursue mergers and acquisitions. The bank\u2019s home loan business saw mixed results as mortgage rates remained high. Wells Fargo\u2019s stock performance has been volatile over the past four years, but 2025 looks promising as the bank forecasts net interest income growth of 1% to 3%, supported by stronger loan demand and lower deposit costs. The Trump administration\u2019s expected deregulation policies could further benefit the financial sector by easing banking oversight, reducing compliance costs, and encouraging lending and deal-making activities.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Millennium Management significantly boosted its investment in Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), increasing its holdings to 13.4 million shares\u2014a 42% rise from over 9.4 million shares held in the previous quarter.

Additionally, data from Insider Monkey revealed that by the end of Q4 2024, 96 hedge funds had positions in Wells Fargo, collectively holding nearly $6.64 billion in shares. This marked a significant increase from Q3 when only 72 hedge funds had investments in the company.\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\u2019s strong financial performance, highlighted by a 47% increase in net income and a surge in investment banking fees, reflects its resilience and ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions. Additionally, growing institutional confidence, as seen in Millennium Management\u2019s 42% increase in holdings and the rising number of hedge funds investing in the company, reinforces its potential as a solid long-term investment.\n\nOverall, WFC ranks 6th on our list of stocks to invest in from Israel Englander\u2019s portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential for WFC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Bankrate\u2019s balance transfer calculator can help you in planning ahead and making informed monthly payments that enable you to pay off your balance before interest begins to accrue.\n\nYou should also consider whether you can afford to put that much money toward your debt repayment each month, or if you\u2019ll need to cut back on other types of spending to make the payments.

The Autograph is the clear winner in terms of which card costs less to keep year after year. This doesn't necessarily mean it offers more benefits than the Sapphire Preferred, but you won't have to worry about an annual cost.\n\nBonus earning categories\n\nWhether you get value from a card's bonus categories depends on your typical spending habits.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Autograph allows you to earn 3X points on restaurants, travel, gas stations, transit, popular streaming services, and phone plans; plus earn 1X points on other purchases.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred offers 5X points on travel purchased through Chase Travel\u2120; 3X points on dining, select streaming services, and online groceries; 2X points on all other travel purchases, and 1X points on all other purchases.\n\nThe tiered earning structure on the Chase Sapphire Preferred can undoubtedly be valuable, but it can also be complex to understand and difficult to remember. The Wells Fargo Autograph earning structure is much more straightforward and allows you to earn the most points per dollar in the categories in which you concentrate your spending.\n\nIntro APR offer\n\nThe Wells Fargo Autograph offers 0% intro APR on purchases for 12 months from account opening, and then a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR. This could be useful if you have upcoming large purchases and want to avoid paying interest on your balance for a while. Since the Sapphire Preferred has no intro APR offers, the Autograph comes out on top.\n\nUnfortunately, the intro APR offer on the Wells Fargo Autograph is only for purchases and does not extend to balance transfers. As such, you won't be able to transfer a balance from a high interest card to your Wells Fargo Autograph card to take advantage of an extended no-interest period to pay off debt. It's still helpful in spreading out a large purchase over time, though.\n\nWhen to go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred\n\nChoose the Chase Sapphire Preferred if:\n\nYou want flexible and potentially more valuable travel rewards.\n\nYou want increased travel coverage.\n\nYou can utilize the DashPass membership.\n\nIncreased redemption value\n\nBoth of these cards offer various redemption options, though the Chase Sapphire Preferred has a perk that could provide you with more value\u2014travel redemptions made through Chase Travel\u2120 receive a 25% boost in value, giving you 1.25 cents per point.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Autograph offers a flat rate redemption value of 1 cent per point regardless of your chosen redemption method. Even though you can get outsized value from your points by transferring them to partners, you can still get great deals through the portal. I booked a night at a Renaissance Marriott last year for fewer Ultimate Rewards Points than I would have paid if I used my Marriott Bonvoy points.\n\nAccess to transfer partners\n\nIf you want to get outsized value from your points, you can transfer them to a hotel or airline partner. The Chase Sapphire Preferred has several valuable transfer partners, including United MileagePlus, Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards, and World of Hyatt. I've transferred my points to Iberia for an American Airlines flight from the East Coast to London, England, which allowed me to book a last minute flight for a fraction of the cost.\n\nWells Fargo previously didn't offer the ability to transfer points to travel partners. It's great news for cardholders that this has been added to Wells Fargo's credit card lineup, but the list of partners is still pretty short. It does include a few valuable international airlines like Air France, Avianca, and British Airways.\n\nEven with Wells Fargo offering more flexibility regarding point redemptions, the Chase Sapphire Preferred still reigns supreme.\n\nComprehensive travel insurance\n\nBoth the Wells Fargo Autograph and Chase Sapphire Preferred offer car rental insurance, but that's about where the travel insurance benefits end on the Autograph. The Sapphire Preferred also offers trip cancellation or interruption insurance, baggage delay insurance, lost luggage reimbursement, and trip delay reimbursement. For frequent travelers, having these protections is invaluable.\n\nAdditional benefits\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred has several benefits that can help justify the annual fee, including a $50 annual hotel credit through Chase Travel\u2120, a complimentary DoorDash DashPass membership (activate by Dec 31, 2027), bonus points on Lyft and Peloton purchases (through Mar 31, 2025), and a 10% anniversary point bonus.\n\nA closer look at the welcome bonuses\n\nThe Wells Fargo Autograph card allows new cardholders to earn 20,000 bonus points when you spend $1,000 in purchases in the first 3 months (that\u2019s a $200 cash redemption value). Although it's a low offer, it is accessible, and almost anyone can meet the spending requirement.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred offers new cardholders a chance to earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening, and those points are worth 25% more if you redeem them through Chase Travel\u2120. This is obviously much more valuable than the Wells Fargo Autograph card, but be sure you can meet the higher spending requirement before you apply.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhich is better, the Wells Fargo Autograph or the Chase Sapphire Preferred? The better credit card between the Wells Fargo Autograph and Chase Sapphire Preferred depends on your spending habits and preferences.

We brought in a panel of experts to share their insights so you can shop for your next card with confidence.\n\nAre there any red flags to look out for when browsing for starter travel cards to apply for?\n\nMaggie Daniels, PhD School of Sport, Recreation and Tourism Management and College of Education and Human Development | George Mason University Travelers should think of credit card red flags as indicators of potentially manipulative practices on the part of the issuing company. Consumers should be on particularly high alert for the following: 1) low introductory annual percentage rate (APR) gimmicks, where credit card companies lure you in with a 0% transfer APR to move all of your debt to their card, and then blindside you with rates of 29.99% or higher at the end of the grace period; 2) travel benefits that do not kick in unless the consumer has spent a minimum of $1,000 and upwards to $10,000 within a short time period, meaning that the issuer is encouraging you to accrue debt; and 3) reserving the most desirable perks for the highest tier, meaning that starter travel cards tend to be the least useful, while elite cards are accompanied by exorbitant annual fees of $500 and up. Dr. Abhijeet Shirsat Associate Professor and Graduate Coordinator | California State University, Sacramento When seeking starter travel credit cards, watch for these red flags: high annual fees, low rewards rates, complicated redemption processes, foreign transaction fees, and high APRs. Avoid cards with unrealistic bonus requirements or limited travel perks. Be cautious of poor customer service, strict approval requirements, and deceptive marketing. Look for cards with reasonable fees, good rewards on your typical spending, easy-to-use points systems, and useful travel benefits. Ensure the card doesn't charge extra for foreign purchases and has attainable approval criteria for those new to credit. Always read the fine print and compare offers before applying.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre frequent travelers the only ones who benefit from having a travel credit card?\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you have to pick just one, the Sapphire Preferred will likely make more sense and bring more value. Even though we prefer the Chase Sapphire Preferred, the Wells Fargo Autograph has plenty going for it \u2014 a $0 annual fee, a simplified earning structure, and an intro APR offer that can help you spread out a big purchase over time. No matter which card you choose, be sure to thoroughly research the options before applying.",

            "content": "Bank of America and Wells Fargo, like a number of other banks in recent weeks, have backed away from diversity, equity and inclusion mentions in their annual filings this week.\n\nWhere the \u201cDiversity and Inclusion\u201d section in Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America\u2019s 10-K was last year is instead a section in this year\u2019s filing titled \u201cTalent, Inclusion and Opportunity.\u201d It refers to the bank\u2019s approach to recruiting, hiring, employee networks and training and development, without mentioning diversity, equity or inclusion.\n\nA table breaking down workforce demographics \u2013 called \u201cDiversity Metrics\u201d in last year\u2019s filing \u2013 is referred to as \u201cWorkforce data\u201d in this year\u2019s. This year\u2019s filing does break out the share of U.S.-based employees identifying as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific, or \u201cTwo or More Races.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s filing mentioned a \u201cdiversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives and policies,\u201d and noted the bank\u2019s \u201cGlobal Diversity and Inclusion Council, which has been in place for over 20 years, is chaired by our CEO and consists of senior executives from every line of business and region.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mention of that council or the diversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives or policies in this year\u2019s filing. A person familiar with the matter said the council is being renamed the \u201cGlobal Opportunity and Inclusion Council.\u201d BofA is also swapping out the \u201cdiversity\u201d in a \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d internal human resources group name, in favor of \u201copportunity and inclusion,\u201d the person said.\n\nAdditionally, the bank will no longer have aspirational DEI-related goals or require a diverse slate of candidates for open roles. Those changes at the bank, which is a government contractor, were driven by the Trump administration\u2019s DEI executive order, the person said. Those changes mirror similar moves at Citi, announced last week by CEO Jane Fraser.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan was asked Tuesday whether the bank has a DEI policy, amid recent backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives due to the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown, but the CEO didn\u2019t answer the question directly.\n\n\u201cWe have diversity and inclusion at our company,\u201d he responded at an event at The Economic Club in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut, step back: we\u2019ve always been the bank of opportunity.\u201d\n\nMoynihan\u2019s \u201copportunity\u201d mention aligns with new wording used in this year\u2019s 10-K, which forgoes diversity and inclusion mentions but asserts \u201cBank of America has always been the bank of opportunity for our shareholders, our clients and customers, our communities and our teammates.\u201d\n\nThe bank, in last year\u2019s filing, said it \u201c[reinforces] our commitment to diversity and inclusion by investing internally in our employee networks and by facilitating voluntary enterprise-wide learning and conversations about various diversity and inclusion topics. In addition, we have practices in place for attracting diverse talent, including campus recruitment.\u201d\n\nThat language is absent from this year\u2019s filing. A Bank of America spokesperson said the bank\u2019s annual report, proxy and its website provide far more detail on the bank\u2019s programs.\n\nThe BofA spokesperson also pointed to a mention in this year\u2019s filing that the bank is \u201cdeliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their career goals.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo, too, has cut a \u201cPromoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d paragraph from this year\u2019s annual filing, as well as any mention of an annual pay equity review.\n\nThat review \u2013 which the bank had conducted with a third-party consultant \u201cfor a number of years,\u201d according to last year\u2019s filing \u2013 compared compensation of women to men globally, and U.S. minorities to U.S. non-minorities, \u201ctaking into account factors such as role, level, tenure, and geography.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more critically, the bank is dropping a 2022 policy that required that 50% or more of that job candidates interviewed for certain roles be diverse.\n\n\u201cIn light of the current environment, we have decided to discontinue the diverse slate guidelines,\u201d Wells Fargo said Wednesday in a memo seen by Bloomberg. \u201cWe remain focused on maintaining a workplace where we hire the best and most qualified people and one where everyone has equal access to opportunities to grow.\u201d\n\nThe policy had a rocky start, as roughly dozen of Wells\u2019 then-current and former employees alleged, in a New York Times report, that the bank held phony job interviews for nonwhite and female job-seekers for positions that had already been offered to other candidates. Wells Fargo paused its policy for several weeks to review and update it. The initial iteration called for a 50% diverse slate for jobs that paid $100,000 a year or more.\n\nWells Fargo asserted Wednesday it would continue to \u201csource a broad pool of candidates\u201d when recruiting.\n\nAlthough championing diversity and inclusion is no longer listed as an expectation for every employee, Wells added this line to this year\u2019s filing: \u201cWe want to be recognized as a great company for everyone by maintaining recruitment and career development practices that support our employees and provide an environment that welcomes people from different backgrounds and with different experiences.\u201d\n\nWells maintained its demographic breakdown in this year\u2019s filing: As of the end of 2024, \u201cour global workforce was 51% female and 49% male, and our U.S. workforce was 54% female and 46% male. Our U.S. workforce was 51% white, 48% racially/ethnically diverse, and 1% undeclared,\u201d this year\u2019s filing said.\n\nTruist\n\nTruist, in its latest annual filing, referred to a table breaking down workforce demographics as \u201cTeammate Composition\u201d rather than \u201cTeammate Diversity.\u201d\n\nIn last year\u2019s 10-K filing, the bank, under a section called \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\u201d said \u201cinclusivity, belonging, and authenticity are at the core of Truist\u2019s evolving culture,\u201d and \u201cDEI continues to play an instrumental role across this evolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruist\u2019s longstanding commitment to DEI thoughtfully positions the organization to lead and execute inclusively,\u201d the bank said last year.\n\nThis year, Truist said it \u201caspires to foster a performance-based culture that is reinforced by belonging and inclusivity. Furthering a sense of belonging drives our teammate mission of creating an inclusive and energizing environment that empowers teammates to learn, grow, and have meaningful careers.\u201d\n\nTruist, Wells and Bank of America join JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Morgan Stanley, Capital One and U.S. Bank among lenders that have de-emphasized mentions of DEI in annual regulatory filings made over the past two weeks.",

Bank of America Corp. will no longer have \u201caspirational\u201d goals for diversity and inclusion, a person familiar with the matter said this week. Citigroup Inc. also said recently that it will abandon a policy for diversity in candidates and interview panels, citing an executive order by Trump that banned \u201cillegal DEI\u201d policies by federal contractors like the bank.\n\nAt Wells Fargo, the changes in the recruitment process come after the bank recently modified references to DEI on its website and took down a page dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nIn its latest annual report, filed Tuesday, Wells Fargo didn\u2019t give goals for its diversity programs, while the filing from a year ago said that Wells Fargo \u201cvalues and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) in every aspect of our business.\u201d Still, the filing from this week highlighted that Wells Fargo has more female than male employees in the US and globally, and that its US workforce is comprised of 51% White employees and 48% racially and ethnically diverse employees, with the rest undeclared.",

            "content": "Key takeaways Preapproval for a Wells Fargo credit card involves a soft credit check to assess eligibility without affecting your credit score.\n\nWells Fargo offers a prequalification tool through its website, but you can also find credit card preapprovals through your online portal, email or mail if you\u2019re eligible.\n\nTo increase your chances of preapproval for a Wells Fargo credit card, improve your credit score by making payments on time and paying down debt.\n\nGood news, Wells Fargo loyalists \u2014 Wells Fargo has introduced yet another card offering to its fleet of rewards credit cards. Released in late June 2024, the Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card* offers unlimited 4 percent cash back rewards on unique spending categories, including gym memberships, salons, electric vehicle charging and select thrift stores. But what about the cult-favorite Bilt Mastercard\u00ae or the Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card? If you\u2019re considering applying for one of these popular credit cards, you may be wondering what you need to do to get preapproved.\n\nNo matter which Wells Fargo credit card you are considering, obtaining preapproval can simplify the application process. Instead of applying for a card and facing potential denial, preapproval allows you to narrow down your options, preventing unnecessary hard inquiries without the benefit of a new credit card to show for it. Find out how to get preapproved for a Wells Fargo credit card and assess your approval odds before applying.\n\nWhat is credit card preapproval?\n\nA credit card preapproval occurs when a credit card issuer screens your credit profile without doing a hard credit inquiry to determine your eligibility for one of their cards. It gives you a clearer understanding of what you might be approved for without negatively impacting your credit score.\n\nSometimes you might also find the terms preapproval and prequalification used interchangeably, though they don\u2019t always mean the same thing. In the case of Wells Fargo, the prequalification tool offered by the issuer simply checks whether you appear to be eligible for its products, but doesn\u2019t assess how likely you are to actually be approved should you apply.\n\nWhich Wells Fargo cards can you get preapproved for?\n\nSince the launch of the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card in 2021, Wells Fargo has consistently introduced exciting new additions to its credit card lineup. With this in mind, you can anticipate ongoing changes regarding which of its cards are available for preapproval.\n\nIn most cases, the details of each credit card issuer\u2019s preapproval process are not publicly disclosed, and Wells Fargo is no exception. While it holds slightly less weight compared to a true preapproval, Wells Fargo does have a prequalification tool that you can use to check your eligibility for each of these cards:\n\nWells Fargo Autograph Journey\u2120 Card\n\nWells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card\n\nWells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card\n\nChoice Privileges\u00ae Mastercard\u00ae\n\nChoice Privileges\u00ae Select Mastercard\u00ae\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the recently released Attune Card will be added to the prequalification tool or preapproval process.\n\nHow to get preapproved for a Wells Fargo credit card\n\nRight now, the only place you can check for preapproved or prequalified Wells Fargo card offers is on the issuer\u2019s website. If you choose to use this option, you\u2019ll need to provide basic information, including your:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nLast 4 digits of your Social Security Number\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to authorize Wells Fargo to do a soft pull of your credit report, which won\u2019t hurt your credit score. After submitting the prequalification, you\u2019ll get a list of the cards you qualify for, along with the option to complete a full application.\n\nStar Icon Keep in mind: Getting prequalified or preapproved doesn\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll be approved for the card once you submit an application and undergo a hard credit check. Generally, you can think of prequalification as an indication that you fall within the target audience for the card. Preapproval means your specific information suggests you\u2019re likely to be approved for the card.\n\nAdditional ways to prequalify for Wells Fargo credit cards\n\nWells Fargo also displays its cards in CardMatch\u2122, Bankrate\u2019s tool for finding card offers matched to your credit profile. While the Wells Fargo offers you\u2019ll see in CardMatch aren\u2019t technically prequalified or preapproved offers, the tool does use a soft pull to your credit to assess which products are best suited to your needs, so it can still give you an idea if you meet the card\u2019s target audience.\n\nIn some cases, you might also receive a preapproved credit card offer from Wells Fargo in the mail. This means the issuer did a soft pull on your credit report and you meet its basic minimum requirements to be approved. If you have an existing account with Wells Fargo, you might receive these offers on your online banking portal or by email.\n\nHow to increase your chances of getting preapproved\n\nWant to boost your chances of getting a preapproval for a Wells Fargo credit card? Most of Wells Fargo\u2019s best credit cards have a credit score requirement of 670 to 850, so improving your credit is the best path to earning preapproval. Take these steps to improve your credit score and optimize your chances:\n\nMake all bill payments on time. Pay down existing credit card balances to improve your credit utilization. Avoid overdrafting your account if you have a Wells Fargo banking relationship. Increase the balances in your Wells Fargo checking or savings accounts if you have those accounts. Update your employment and income information with Wells Fargo. Avoid opening too many other credit lines at once.\n\nYour payment history is the largest factor in determining your FICO score, so paying bills on time is the most important move you can make. Your credit utilization ratio also plays a large part in your credit score, so paying down credit card debt should be a priority. Doing so can decrease your credit utilization rate, which shows lenders you\u2019re not at risk of overextending yourself.\n\n\u201cI recommend maintaining a good credit score, managing your debt responsibly and having a stable income to increase your chances of preapproval for a Wells Fargo credit card. Lenders look for borrowers who demonstrate financial responsibility and stability, so focusing on these key factors can help improve your eligibility for a Wells Fargo credit card offer.\u201d \u2014 Re'Dreyona Walker, Bankrate credit cards editor\n\nAdditional ways to increase your chances\n\nAn underrated method of increasing your chances for preapproval is having a healthy long-term banking relationship with Wells Fargo. When I worked in the banking industry, the credit card underwriting team paid attention to the balances you held in your accounts, your overdraft history and how long you had been banking with us, alongside your credit score.\n\nOn multiple occasions, I was able to appeal a limited credit history denial by referencing that the customer had minimal or zero overdrafts, high checking or savings balances and a banking relationship of at least two years. They\u2019d often walk away with an approval and a small credit limit instead of an automated denial.\n\nAnother way to increase your chances of a preapproval is to update your income with Wells Fargo. Even if you don\u2019t already have a credit card with them, you can update your employment and income information through a customer service representative, which could trigger a preapproval in their system if your credit score is already within the required range.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nPursuing a Wells Fargo credit card preapproval is a good idea since this issuer requires good to excellent credit scores for most of its credit cards. Getting preapproved gives you the chance to gauge your eligibility before you put in the effort (and hard inquiry) to apply.\n\nIn some cases, preapproved offers are an even better deal than what the general public sees. Either way, a Wells Fargo preapproval only requires a soft pull that won\u2019t hurt your credit score. That\u2019s good news if you\u2019re considering a new credit card and are ready to explore your options but not quite ready to apply.\n\n*The information about the Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card has been collected independently by Bankrate.com.

            "content": "Sophia Lutzker Villanova should bring the same energy as Wells games on campus.\n\nIf you are reading this article, there is a high chance that you have entered one of Villanova\u2019s ticket lotteries through the \u2018Nova tickets app or purchased tickets externally. It is very easy to identify when ticket winners are announced because suddenly everyone is either selling a ticket or asking every club\u2019s GroupMe if there are any leftover tickets.\n\nThe most desirable of all lottery games at Villanova are the men\u2019s basketball games played at the Wells Fargo Center, in south Philadelphia. The Wells Fargo Center is a large arena most often the host for the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76ers, which play all of their home games there.\n\nAs a freshman, I have only experienced a select few of these games and the respective tailgates, but even so, these games can be rather overhyped. The men\u2019s basketball team has performed better at the Finneran Pavilion on campus and travelling to the Wells Fargo Center is often not worth it.\n\nWith no traffic, the drive from Villanova\u2019s campus to the Wells Fargo Center ranges from 30 to 40 minutes. Thirty minutes without traffic can easily become one hour when accompanied by the almost constant Philadelphia traffic on all highways leading into the city throughout the weekend when the Wells Fargo Games occur.\n\nIn addition, paying for Ubers can become expensive, even when splitting the cost with friends. Any Uber heading in the Philadelphia direction will cost a minimum of $30 and will increase if there is traffic. This is often a conflict for students who want to make it to the tailgates in time before the game begins.\n\nMany of you are probably reading this article thinking that anyone who pays upwards of $30 for an Uber to the Wells Fargo Center is insane for not taking the SEPTA from campus. I had the same thoughts, as well, until I took the SEPTA from South Campus straight to the Wells Fargo Center. It isn\u2019t necessarily accurate to say \u201cstraight,\u201d because we had to transfer trains a minimum of two times before arriving.\n\nUnless you are from Philadelphia or know someone who is, it can be difficult to navigate the subway system and transfer to the correct trains that stop in South Philadelphia. When three friends and I attempted the SEPTA alternative instead of Uber, we had to keep our eyes on anyone with Villanova merch. If there had been no Villanova students on the train with us, it would have been much more difficult to know what we were doing. Although these may seem like trivial complaints, they are contributing factors to the overall Wells Fargo experience.\n\nAlthough the Campus Activities Team does a great job supplying shuttles for students to and from main campus to the Wells Fargo Center, advertising these rides and increasing the number of buses could possibly decrease the number of confused students attempting the SEPTA. If students are more aware of the various options on campus for transportation into the city, the issues above may lose relevance.\n\nWhile the excitement surrounding Villanova men\u2019s basketball games at the Wells Fargo Center may seem appealing on the surface, the reality is that the experience is often overhyped and not as accessible as it can be. Although impressive, the Wells Fargo Center is far from convenient for many students, creating challenges that diminish the overall enjoyment of the games.\n\nInstead of focusing off-campus, we can bring things closer to campus in the Finneran Pavilion increasing attendance and the overall vibe surrounding the games.",

This offer gives cardholders nearly two years to pay off large expenses or consolidate debt without incurring interest. However, it's essential to note that after the intro period ends, a variable APR applies based on your creditworthiness. Is it worth getting a 0% credit card? chevron-down chevron-up Yes, a 0% intro APR credit card can be highly beneficial, particularly if you plan to make a large purchase or transfer a high-interest balance. These cards allow you to pay off balances over time without accruing interest, which can lead to significant savings. However, to maximize their benefits, it's crucial to pay off the balance before the promotional period ends to avoid interest charges on any remaining amount. Does 0% APR hurt credit? chevron-down chevron-up No. Getting a 0% APR credit card does not inherently hurt your credit score. In fact, responsible use \u2014 like making on-time payments and keeping your credit utilization low \u2014 can help improve your credit over time. However, applying for a new credit card results in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which may cause a slight, temporary dip in your score. Additionally, if you accumulate too much debt and fail to pay it off before the intro APR expires, it could negatively impact your credit utilization ratio and overall score. What happens when a 0% APR period ends? chevron-down chevron-up Once the 0% intro APR period expires, any remaining balance on your credit card will begin accruing interest at the card\u2019s standard variable APR. This rate is typically based on your creditworthiness at the time of application. To avoid paying interest, it\u2019s best to pay off your balance before the introductory period ends. Can you transfer a balance from one 0% APR card to another? chevron-down chevron-up Yes, some cardholders choose to transfer a balance from one 0% APR credit card to another to extend their interest-free period. However, most balance transfers come with a fee (typically 3% to 5% of the transferred amount). Additionally, opening multiple new accounts within a short time frame can impact your credit score, so weigh the potential benefits against the costs.\n\nHow We Chose the Best 0% Intro APR Credit Cards of 2025\n\nThe best 0% introductory or low interest credits carry lower APRs for new cardholders, balance transfers and other promotions.

            "content": "Amid intense competition, Wells Fargo\u2019s commercial banking division is doubling down on its products and hiring this year to grow that segment of the lender\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making investments to capitalize and continue to not only serve our current client base \u2026 but also prospects in winning new business,\u201d said Mary Katherine DuBose, head of specialized industries at Wells Fargo commercial lending, during a recent interview.\n\nThe lender\u2019s commercial banking segment covers middle-market and emerging middle-market companies generating $25 million to $2 billion in annual revenue. In particular, the bank is expanding its team serving clients on the lower end of that scale.\n\nMary Katherine DuBose Permission granted by Wells Fargo\n\nDuring the San Francisco-based bank\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Charlie Scharf said Wells has added relationship managers and business development officers in underpenetrated markets to fuel client acquisition and revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, total revenue for the bank\u2019s commercial segment dropped 6% year over year, and 5% from the prior quarter, to $3.17 billion.\n\nScharf didn\u2019t specify a number of those hired \u2013 and DuBose declined to \u2013 but he said the bank plans to boost headcount even more this year.\n\nMarkets or industries where the bank isn\u2019t as well-penetrated, or doesn\u2019t have a No. 1 or 2 market share position, are getting particular attention, DuBose said.\n\nShe declined to specify which markets or industries that would include, or quantify investments made, but said it\u2019s \u201cthe same industry groups that you see the greatest amount of activity\u201d from an equity capital markets perspective.\n\nThe bank expects to spend about $54.2 billion this year, allocating about $900 million toward incremental technology expenses and $900 million toward other investments including targeted hiring, according to fourth-quarter earnings materials.\n\nEspecially high priority for Wells: snagging investment banking business with commercial banking clients, DuBose said. That means her area of the bank is staying connected with investment banking partners, developing payments and liquidity products within treasury management, and making sure a full suite of debt products is available to support clients, DuBose said. The bank has also sought to \u201cbe in the conversation\u201d to support clients\u2019 M&A activity.\n\nStill, Wells isn\u2019t alone, DuBose noted. \u201cThe price to enter new client relationships is the same for everyone. It\u2019s multiproduct, generally \u2013 wanting to do more with the client. And so, for that reason, it is competitive. And so our goal will be to continue to put the best people and the best products in front of our clients.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the bank\u2019s partnership with Centerbridge Partners, to offer direct lending to middle market clients, as an example of investment in products, referring to it as another tool in the toolkit, to make sure Wells is able to offer clients as many options as possible.\n\nThe lender covers clients by geographic location with a more generalist coverage model, or with specialized teams in certain sectors, such as government, healthcare, agribusiness, beverage distribution, commercial auto, gaming and technology, DuBose said.\n\nCommercial clients might be looking to finance equipment purchases or business expansion, whether that\u2019s through an additional customer contract or an acquisition; or clients could be looking to make an investment in their business, such as a car dealership buying or rehabbing another location, she said.\n\nNoting some clients have had an acquisition in their business plan and held off, DuBose indicated the bank expects a rise in merger and acquisition activity. Pipelines feel strong, \u201cbut they have to close,\u201d DuBose acknowledged.\n\nA bank survey released this month revealed commercial business sentiment spiked following the November election. President Donald Trump\u2019s win signaled an era of less regulation and more business-friendly attitudes, expected to fuel more M&A activity. But Trump\u2019s second presidency has also come with concerns around tariffs, and inflation has remained stubborn.\n\n\u201cEven in each of our industry types, we\u2019ll have different reactions\u201d to those developments, DuBose said. \u201cIn some cases, there's an increased cost of doing business. In some cases, there continues to be some compression in the workforce or challenges in retaining employees. I do think for some companies, stabilization of that will be important, before either returning to a lot of drawdown on debt lines, or utilization of capital to make acquisitions or whatnot.\u201d\n\nThe macroeconomic environment, on a day-to-day basis, doesn\u2019t really affect the bank\u2019s support of its client base, but Wells does keep an eye on interest rate movement and geopolitical developments, she noted.\n\n\u201cIn the middle market, these are long-term relationships, so hopefully stability of support is important,\u201d she said. Rather than \u201cthese all being transactions, they are relationships.\u201d",

            "content": "HBCU Students from Bowie State, Morgan State, Norfolk State and Texas Southern Dive into the Power of Owning vs. Renting\n\nMEDIA CONTACT: David Thompson, dlthompson@bowiestate.edu, 301-860-4311\n\n(BOWIE, Md.) \u2014 More than 100 students from Bowie State University, Morgan State University, Norfolk State University, and Texas Southern University gathered Tuesday to learn the financial skills needed to transition from renters to homeowners, guided by top executives from Wells Fargo and HomeFree USA\u2019s Center for Financial Advancement. Hosted at Bowie State, the event offered these students a clear roadmap to understanding the benefits of owning a home over renting.\n\nHomeFree USA\u2019s Center for Financial Advancement is a vital resource for Historically Black College and University (HBCU) students to opening the doors to careers in mortgage and real estate finance. The program focuses on building money management skills, improving credit knowledge, and laying the groundwork for long-term wealth through homeownership- a mission that\u2019s already making a difference.\n\n\u201cThis is the seventh year we have been working with HBCUs,\u201d said Luwanna Williams, Director of the Center for Financial Management, her passion palpable. \u201cIt is important that students understand the significance of owning a home to help build wealth. We want to make sure students at Bowie State and other HBCUs learn about first-time home buyer programs and other options that will help them buy property.\u201d Her words resonate like a rallying cry for a new generation of homeowners.\n\nFor Texas Southern University junior Makai Branch Jr., a finance major with big ambitions, the session was nothing short of a revelation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of what it takes to buy a house,\u201d he said. \u201cThis program has opened my eyes to what it will take for me to own rather than rent and the types of upfront costs I\u2019ll need to consider.\u201d The session gave him a clearer path to achieving that goal.\n\nStudents were given information about the Wells Fargo $10,000 Down Payment Homebuyer Access grant, a 3% down payment option, and a program that offers up to $5,000 for one-time closing costs, such as appraisal and processing fees.\n\nArianna Redmond is a junior pre-med major at Bowie State and a budding entrepreneur with her sights set sky-high. She\u2019s not just aiming to become a physician \u2014 she\u2019s planning to pursue her goal of owning residential and commercial properties \u2014 \u201cIt was amazing the amount of material they covered during the meeting,\u201d said Redmond. \u201cThe basics of financial literacy, resume building, finding jobs and careers were covered in the meeting in addition to building up your credit scores. My ultimate goal is to become a physician but I also want to own homes and commercial property.\u201d\n\n\u201cWells Fargo is committed to helping people from various backgrounds to achieve the American Dream of owning a home,\u201d said Donna Greene, the company\u2019s Vice President of Diverse Segments Home Lending. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for advancing home ownership in diverse communities and that occurs through attaining financial knowledge. HBCU students are critical in building wealth for the next generation and buying a home is where it all begins.\u201d\n\nBy equipping students with financial knowledge early on, initiatives like this aim to lay the foundation for long-term success, helping them turn their aspirations into reality.\n\n###\n\nAbout Bowie State University\n\nFounded in 1865, Bowie State University is the first Historically Black College/University (HBCU) in Maryland and one of the ten oldest in the country.

            "content": "Consumers Continue to Navigate Persistent Inflation by Changing Life Plans; Say They Want to Learn New Money Behaviors, According to Second Annual Wells Fargo Money Study\n\n02/25/2025 - 08:00 AM\n\nNinety percent of Americans report that they are still surprised by high prices of items like water, gas, eating out and attending events\n\nFifty-five percent saying they have delayed some of their life plans to navigate economic conditions over the past year\n\nEighty-three percent want to learn new ways of thinking about money and dealing with their money\n\nNEW YORK --(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Seventy-six percent of Americans are cutting back on spending, up from 67% in 2024, according to findings from the second annual Wells Fargo Money Study.\n\nWells Fargo Money Study (Graphic: Wells Fargo)\n\nFor adults in the first half of their financial lives, these numbers are even higher, with 82% of Gen Z adults and 79% of Millennials cutting back. And while not as high, it\u2019s also of note that the youngest populations in the study are adapting to the current economic conditions with 60% of teens also reporting that they\u2019re reducing their spending. In keeping with this theme, 60% of Americans say they are making tough financial choices to navigate their lives. Nearly as many ( 55% ) said that those tough choices may involve delaying some life plans. Among those delaying life plans, a majority cite delayed travel more than anything else ( 74% ), followed by home renovations ( 39% ), relocation ( 30% ), and buying a home ( 30% ). One in six ( 17% ) have delayed education plans, one in seven ( 14% ) have delayed getting married, and one in eight ( 13% ) have delayed retiring.\n\nInvestment and Insurance Products: Not FDIC Insured No Bank Guarantee May Lose Value\n\n\u201cConsumer behaviors are shifting. The value of the dollar and what it is providing may not be as predictable anymore, which seems to be more pronounced for younger Americans,\u201d said Michael Liersch, head of Advice and Planning at Wells Fargo. \u201cThere is a clear social narrative surrounding the question: \u2018do I, and will I, have enough?\u2019 The fact that these questions are being asked is positive because we know the earlier that people focus on their spending, saving, and investing behaviors, the more time they have to course correct to achieve their financial goals.\u201d\n\nAt the forefront, consumers continue to navigate higher than expected prices\n\nNearly all those surveyed ( 90% ) responded they feel \u201csticker shock\u201d in one or more areas of common spending, including eating out, attending a concert, buying a bottle of water, or downloading a video game, and say actual costs are between 55% and 200% higher than what they expect.\n\nSticker Shock in Six Areas of Consumer Spending % Shocked Expected Cost Actual\n\nCost How Much Higher than Expected Eating out or food delivery 76% $23 $40 74% A tank of gas 63% $40 $62 55% Concert or sporting event tickets 39% $70 $150 114% A bottle of water 36% $1 $3 200% A greeting or birthday card 24% $3 $6 100% A video game download or streaming service 21% $20 $50 150%\n\n\u201cSpending is one of the most important factors to staying on track with your goals,\u201d says Liersch. \u201cI would encourage people to continue to evaluate their financial choices and align their spending with what matters most to them. Life happens and making incremental progress toward a goal and adjusting timelines along the way \u2013 including setbacks \u2013 are all a part of the process. Staying focused on what we want to accomplish can get us through the twists and turns of our financial journey.\u201d\n\nNearly all Americans ( 94% ) acknowledge that they want to do just that: align money choices with their values. And almost as many ( 86% ) want to be more intentional and thoughtful about their spending.\n\nAccording to Liersch, \u201cthese insights highlight that Americans are not just winging it. They are being extraordinarily introspective and thoughtful as they navigate their financial priorities and work toward achieving their financial goals.\u201d\n\nAmericans say they don\u2019t judge others\u2019 financial circumstances, but they do judge themselves\n\nAmericans overwhelmingly say they believe the amount of money their friends or family members have doesn\u2019t matter. Almost nine out of 10 ( 87% ) say it makes no difference to them how much money another person has, and nearly as many ( 82% ) say their friends include people of different levels of wealth.\n\nYet more than half ( 56% ) keep secret how much they have, with a third of them ( 32% ) saying it\u2019s because they are trying to avoid people judging them. Regardless of whether they keep money secrets or not, more than half of respondents ( 53% ) say people knowing how much money they have would create stress.\n\nReasons People Keep Money Secrets Money is a private topic for me 65% So that people do not judge me 32% The truth might result in people asking for money 30% The truth might change how others see me 27% The truth might change my interactions with people and what we do together 24%\n\nA substantial number of those surveyed also spend time thinking about how much money other people have \u2013 and wishing they could have more themselves. Almost half ( 47% ) responded they often feel envious of how much money other people have, and nearly as many ( 45% ) often compare their financial situation to others. More than one in three ( 37% ) admit to obsessing about getting rich, a third ( 34% ) admire social media millionaires, and about one in four ( 23% ) admit to sometimes overspending just to keep up with people around them.\n\n\u201cAmericans appear comfortable with other people being authentic about their financial situation, which is encouraging to see,\u201d Liersch says. \u201cSo now it\u2019s time to look inwardly and overcome our own self-judgment. Let\u2019s challenge ourselves with the following question: how can we lower focus on others and define financial success on our own terms? Resetting the frame of reference from others to our own personal benchmark may help us better spend time and energy on our best next step.\u201d\n\nAmericans have clear financial goals, and want help to overcome challenges\n\nEighty-six percent of respondents say they have a clear picture of what they want their money to do for them. And the vast majority are optimistic about how to do it: 87% say now is a good time to save and 65% say now is a good time to invest. Yet nearly two-thirds say they need a mental reset ( 61% ), and the following factors are holding them back:\n\nHabits are not easy to change ( 48% )\n\n) They focus on today rather than tomorrow ( 43% )\n\n) They do not know enough about money and finance ( 32% )\n\n) They have a lot of others relying on them financially ( 29% )\n\n) They feel social and peer pressure ( 15% )\n\nTo overcome these challenges in making progress to their goals, Americans are seeking more financial advice year over year. Last year, 24% said they were seeking more advice from others; this year it\u2019s 36% . Looking across generations, the desire for more advice is higher with teens ( 54% ), Gen Z adults ( 61% ) and Millennials ( 46% ).\n\n\u201cYounger generations are innovating and leading the way in so many areas. In this case they are leading in the desire to learn more about money and make informed financial decisions. And Americans are saying: Now is the time,\u201d said Liersch.\n\nAbout Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) is a leading financial services company that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets.

The central bank expressed concerns over the increase in inflation and the potential impact of Trump's fiscal, trade and immigration policies. The U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index fell to a 15-month low of 64.7 in February compared to a revised final reading of 71.7 in January. The S&P Global's flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a 17-month low of 50.4 in the same period compared to 52.7 in January. In addition to the previously announced plans to impose duties on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, Trump will soon add tariffs on lumber and forest products. Analysts are concerned that Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariff policies will soften consumer demand and can potentially start a global trade war.\n\nThe three most widely followed U.S. indexes lost their ground during the holiday-shortened trading week.

It\u2019s still pending. I don\u2019t recognize it. I don\u2019t authorize this transaction,.\u2019 They said, \u2018no, we\u2019re going to let it hit the other account, and we\u2019ll investigate.\u201d\n\nThe very next morning, Jose says an additional $20,000 left the business account.\n\nSaid Jose to the bank,\n\n\u201cThe same thing happened last night, you guys got to stop it, another $20,000 in less than 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThe couple says they don\u2019t understand why Wells Fargo allowed the second $20,000 transfer to go through when they had already been alerted of the first fraudulent transaction.\n\nAfter filing a claim, Wells Fargo said it detected no fraud in the disappearance of their money, declaring the investigation is over.\n\nThe couple ultimately initiated a criminal investigation, and the Fort Bend County Sheriff\u2019s Detective confirmed they also believed the transfers were fraudulent, sending subpoenas to Wells Fargo and a bank in Alabama where the direct pay account is located.\n\nSays Amanda,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. At the end of the day, the bank is there to protect customers and they\u2019ve done absolutely nothing to do that. They wrote us a letter saying this is not fraud. Sorry.\n\nFortunately, this came from a business account. It didn\u2019t affect our personal account. Had it been someone else, like our parents or someone old or retired who rely on this, what would they do? How would they pay their bills?\u201d\n\nWells Fargo told the Vasquezes that the \u201ccase was closed,\u201d a spokesperson for the bank told FOX 26 that it is still investigating.\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But premium Chase credit cards, like the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, earn premium rewards, such as an elevated points value in the Chase Travel\u2122 portal or the option to transfer points to an airline or hotel partner.\n\nThe good news is that you can transfer your points from the Chase Freedom Unlimited card to a premium card for those elevated benefits. The process is simple and is done within the Chase Travel portal. Rather than selecting to redeem your points, you'd select \"combine points\" under \"earn/use.\" Once transferred, you can redeem points for the higher value on your premium card.\n\nYou spend a lot on dining out\n\nIf you love to eat out, whether at home or while traveling, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card allows you to earn 3% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service. This could be a significant difference compared to Wells Fargo's 2% cash rewards on purchases.\n\nYou always pay for travel insurance\n\nIf you travel frequently, it makes sense to protect your purchases with travel insurance. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card offers several travel benefits that the Active Cash card doesn't that keeps money in your pocket as long as you pay for your travel accommodations with your Chase card:\n\nTrip cancellation/interruption insurance: If you become ill or the weather cancels your travel plans, you may be reimbursed up to $1,500 per person (up to $6,000 per trip) for prepaid passenger fares.\n\nIf you become ill or the weather cancels your travel plans, you may be reimbursed up to $1,500 per person (up to $6,000 per trip) for prepaid passenger fares.

Auto rental collision damage waiver: Receive theft and collision damage coverage for rental cars paid with your Chase card.\n\nWhile the Wells Fargo card offers similar benefits, including emergency assistance services and an auto rental collision damage waiver, the trip cancellation/interruption insurance is worth much more and doesn't cost you a penny.\n\nLearn more in our Chase Freedom Unlimited review.\n\nWhen to go with Wells Fargo Active Cash\n\nChoose the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card if:\n\nYou love to find ways to save money\n\nYou prefer simple rewards without worrying about categories\n\nYou want more flexible redemption options than Chase offers\n\nYou always look for coupons or promo codes\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash cardholders get access to personalized deals from various merchants. To take advantage of them, you must activate the deals first, so it pays to check back frequently to see what offers are available.\n\nYou must pay with your Wells Fargo card to get the deal, and then you receive it as a statement credit, so it's like a discount off your purchase as it lowers your total balance due.\n\nYou don't want to mess with spending categories\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash Card doesn't have any spending categories. You earn a flat 2% cash rewards on purchases. This makes it one of the best reward credit cards for beginners. It's also a great option for people who only want to carry one card.\n\nWhile that might not seem like a big reward, you get it on everything, whereas most cards, including the Chase Freedom Unlimited card, earn a lower percentage on purchases that don't fall under a specific category.\n\nSo if you don't spend in those three categories often, you're better off with the Wells Fargo card.\n\nYou like flexible redemption options\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash Card offers more unique redemption options that I think are valuable, including:\n\nRedeem for purchases: You can redeem your rewards to offset a purchase made with your Wells Fargo card as long as it's for at least $1 and you have enough rewards to cover the entire purchase.\n\nYou can redeem your rewards to offset a purchase made with your Wells Fargo card as long as it's for at least $1 and you have enough rewards to cover the entire purchase.

Redeem for gift cards: Like most reward credit cards, you can redeem your points for gift cards in $25 increments.\n\nAlso, like the Chase Freedom Unlimited card, you can redeem your rewards for travel purchases, including flights, car rentals, and hotel stays.\n\nLearn more in our Wells Fargo Active Cash review.\n\nKey differences between the two cards\n\nWhile the Chase Freedom Unlimited and Wells Fargo Active Cash Card have many similarities, there are some differences to consider.\n\nEarning rate\n\nIf earning cash rewards for your purchases is a top priority, consider the rewards rates on both cards.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited: 6.5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel\u2120, 4.5% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service and 3% cash back on all other purchases (on up to $20,000 spent in the first year). After your first year or $20,000 spent, earn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel\u2120, 3% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service and unlimited 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.\n\n6.5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel\u2120, 4.5% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service and 3% cash back on all other purchases (on up to $20,000 spent in the first year). After your first year or $20,000 spent, earn 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel\u2120, 3% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service and unlimited 1.5% cash back on all other purchases. Wells Fargo Active Cash: Earn unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases.\n\nThe Freedom Unlimited might seem more appealing because it has several bonus categories.\n\nBut if you want a low-stress credit card with a simple earning structure, the Active Cash might be the better choice. You don't have to worry about bonus categories with this card because of its simple rate. Earn unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases, which covers most purchases including everyday expenses such as gas, groceries, and utilities.\n\nCompare this to the Freedom Unlimited which receives no rewards advantage over the Active Cash for gas, groceries, or utilities. With the Freedom Unlimited, you would earn a 1.5% cash back rate on all other purchases.\n\nWinner: For an everyday, low-stress earning rate, the Active Cash might be a simple option. See more details about this card in our Wells Fargo Active Cash review.\n\nBonus categories\n\nEarning additional rewards through bonus categories gives your dollars more cashback power, but only if the categories align with your everyday expenses.\n\nThe Freedom Unlimited offers 5% total cash back on qualifying Lyft rides through March 31, 2025, 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel\u2120, and 3% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash doesn't have category-specific earning rates. Instead, you can earn unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases.\n\nLyft and travel purchased through Chase Travel\u2120 are specific categories and might not be beneficial on a frequent basis. But earning 3% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service could be valuable in many situations.\n\nLet's say you typically spend $500 per month on dining and drugstore purchases, $500 per month on groceries, and $250 per month on gas for a total spend of $1,250. This is how much you could earn in cash rewards with each card after one month:\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited: $26.25\n\n$26.25 Wells Fargo Active Cash: $25\n\nAfter your first year or $20,000 spent, the Freedom Unlimited offers 3% on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible delivery service ($500 x 0.03 = $15) and 1.5% on all other purchases ($750 x .015 = $11.25). Your total cash rewards could be $26.25.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash allows you to earn unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases ($1,250 x .02 = $25) so you could earn a total of $25 in cash rewards.\n\nWinner: Because of its bonus categories, the Freedom Unlimited edges the Active Cash in this example, but different spending patterns may give different results. Learn more about this card in our Chase Freedom Unlimited review.\n\nTravel redemptions\n\nTravel redemptions might not be a big deal for most cardmembers using a cashback rewards credit card. But both of these cards offer ways to redeem your rewards for travel, including flights and hotel stays, and the process varies.\n\nThe Freedom Unlimited uses the Chase Ultimate Rewards program, a popular program for frequent travelers, for its redemptions. This is especially true if you have a premium card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae card as you can transfer your points to it and receive an elevated value for the points through Chase Travel.\n\nThe Active Cash uses Wells Fargo Rewards for its travel redemptions, a travel portal that's not as widely known as its Chase counterpart.\n\nThere's no clear winner here. Apart from more users knowing about and using the Chase travel portal, you'd find that both portals function like third-party travel sites such as Expedia or Priceline. The travel redemption experience would be familiar enough for most cardholders, so neither card stands out.\n\nProtection benefits\n\nPopular credit cards are often known for their valuable protection benefits, including purchase protection, extended warranty protection, and cell phone protection.\n\nThe Freedom Unlimited offers both purchase and extended warranty protection but doesn't offer cell phone protection.\n\nOn the other hand, the Active Cash Card offers cell phone protection (subject to a $25 deductible), but it lacks purchase protection and extended warranty protection.\n\nAll three protections are helpful to have, but choosing one card over the other based on these benefits alone depends on your situation. Would you rather have extra protection for your eligible purchases or coverage for phones on your cell phone bill?\n\nWinner: Cell phone protection is typically less common, so the Active Cash might have a slight edge over the Freedom Unlimited.\n\nTravel benefits\n\nTravel benefits are something many cards offer, but each has its own terms and conditions.\n\nThe Freedom Unlimited provides:\n\nTrip cancellation or interruption insurance : This insurance might reimburse you if you purchased a flight or a trip that was then canceled or interrupted due to a covered event.\n\n: This insurance might reimburse you if you purchased a flight or a trip that was then canceled or interrupted due to a covered event.

You'd be responsible for the costs of the service provider you use.\n\n: This service helps put you in touch with a towing company or a locksmith in your area if your car breaks down or you get locked out of your vehicle.

Yes, the Chase Freedom Unlimited offers these travel insurance benefits: Trip cancellation or interruption insurance\n\nAuto rental collision damage waiver The Freedom Unlimited also offers its cardmembers travel and emergency assistance services, purchase protection, and extended warranty protection. What credit score is needed for the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card? You may need a good to excellent credit score to qualify for the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card. The FICO scoring model uses these ranges to calculate credit scores: Good: 670 to 739\n\nVery good: 740 to 799\n\nExcellent: 800 to 850 Do note that numerical credit scores are provided as guidelines only and are not a guarantee of approval. Is 2% cash rewards a good rate? Two percent cash rewards rate might be a good earning rate for flat-rate cashback credit cards. It's common for many rewards cards to offer 1.5% cash back, so earning 2% would be an above-average rate. Keep in mind that certain cards might offer more than 2% back in specific bonus categories such as groceries or dining.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Chase Freedom Unlimited and Wells Fargo Active Cash both offer cash rewards on eligible purchases, but they cater to different audiences.\n\nFor example, you might prefer the Active Cash for its cell phone protection and flat rewards rate. But the Freedom Unlimited would make sense if your everyday purchases align with its bonus categories.\n\nTo choose the right card, evaluate your average annual spending and see which card would offer you the greatest benefits.",

In the second quarter, the corporation announced that it will raise interest rates on its cash sweep programs, lowering income by around $350 million each year.\n\nWells Fargo Class Action Settlement 2025\n\nThe Wells Fargo Bank Settlement of 2025 is a major conclusions to a decade of illegal account operations that have harmed millions of consumers. Wells Fargo\u2019s $1 billion settlement fund attempts to compensate people harmed while settling class-action lawsuits related to fraudulent conduct. This settlement emphasizes accountability within the banking industry and provides much-needed relief to clients who have experienced financial losses.\n\nMillions of Wells Fargo customers are eligible to compensation for a slew of wrongdoings perpetrated by the bank over the last decade. In its function as a federal watchdog, CFPB imposed a USD 3.7 billion penalty on Wells Fargo in December 2022, with USD 2 billion owed to customers.\n\nWells Fargo Settlement 2025 Details\n\nOrganization Name Wells Fargo Bank Country America Settlement Amount USD 2 Billion Payment Dates Available soon Category Finance Official Website wellsfargosecuritiesclassaction.com\n\nWho can get the payment?\n\nWith one in every three American households having a Wells Fargo account, the bank\u2019s soiled business practices have had a substantial influence on a large percentage of the public. If you have a Wells Fargo account, you must understand the potential harm, how current payments are being handled, and keep a watch out for any new issues in the future.\n\nIf you were affected, you may use wellsfargosecuritiesclassaction.com to get more details, if you should seek compensation, and whether you were harmed. Fraudulent actions have compromised approximately 16 million of the bank\u2019s accounts. These settlements address serious claims against the bank, with a focus on potential malfeasance and fraudulent activity. Those who were harmed by bank might expect to be reimbursed as early as this year.\n\nWells Fargo Settlement 2025 Amount\n\nMillions of fraudulent accounts were set up in consumers\u2019 names without their knowledge or consent, resulting in unlawful fees and other financial troubles. Borrowers were subjected to illegal fees, unlawful foreclosures, and mismanaged insurance payments. CFPB imposed a USD 3.7 billion penalty on Wells Fargo in December 2022 and it includes $2 billion in consumer compensation and $1.7 billion in civil fines.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Class Action Settlement Payment Amount 2025 provides much-needed financial relief to people affected by the bank\u2019s illegal conduct. If you qualify, register your claim as soon as possible and keep an eye on the official Wells Fargo website for any developments. This deal is a vital step toward rebuilding trust in one of America\u2019s greatest financial institutions, as it addresses these systemic concerns.\n\nWells Fargo Settlement 2025 Payment Date\n\nAccording to the complaint, Wells Fargo provided 0.15% interest to cash-sweep account users for most of 2023, while the return on short-term US Treasury Bills stayed around 5.25% for most of last year, resulting in a 36-fold disparity. The complaint also claims that the lender gives account customers 0.02% interest on their cash sweep account balances.\n\nThe bank has been under fire from regulators for underpaying interest rates on cash sweep accounts, among other allegations of malfeasance. Last October, Wells Fargo revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the cash sweep options it provided to its advising clients. During an earnings call in July, the lender said that it was boosting rates on its cash sweep program for advising brokerage customers.\n\nWells Fargo is just one of several banking companies that might face regulatory inquiry for its cash sweep operations. Morgan Stanley stated that it is facing two putative class actions relating its cash sweep programs for retail clients, and that the firm is cooperating with the SEC on the subject.

Share your story idea with Abby.\n\nInterest rates are now one of many factors decreasing confidence in the national housing market as the new year begins.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo released their Housing Market Index earlier this month, which surveys builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes.\n\nConfidence is at a 5-month low at 42 points, a 5-point decrease compared to January.\n\nConfidence in homebuilder market decreases amid tariff talks\n\nWill Ruder, executive vice president of The Home Builders Association of Greater Kansas City, said the metro is historically insulated from deep market fluctuation.\n\n\u201cKansas City is unique,\u201d Ruder said. \u201cOur peaks are never as high, but our valleys are never as low.\u201d\n\nWe talked to him this time last year about code changes in Kansas City, Missouri, that slowed work.\n\nIn 2024, permit applications were down 54% in Kansas City proper, but up 14% across the metro.\n\n\u201cOur housing policy here in Kansas City is largely made at City Hall,\u201d Ruder said. \u201cSo we are encouraging our city leaders to recognize that. Both their current residents as well as their future residents are in an intense competition for relatively limited supply and we need more housing.\u201d\n\nExperts said proposed tariffs, stagnant interest rates and the risk of deportation for some skilled workers could increase the time and cost of building a home.\n\nRuder encouraged cities to recognize that they can control local policy to make home building easier.\n\nRuder suggested that future home buyers look at what\u2019s currently on the market as a potential solution to anticipated rising costs.\n\n\u201cIf you are looking for some stability or at least known cost, what is out there today from the speculative environment, something that was built prior to a buyer being identified is probably a way to hedge against some of those future disruptions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Housing Market Index is a monthly survey tracked by NAHB/Wells Fargo and can be found here.\n\n\u2014",

The puck drops at 1:00 ET, and you can watch it all unfold on NBCS. The game will be played at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, PA. In this non-conference matchup, the Oilers are favored by -1.5 vs. the Flyers. The over/under for the game is 6 goals.\n\nEdmonton vs. Philadelphia Key Information\n\nTeams: Oilers at Flyers\n\nOilers at Flyers Where: Wells Fargo Center Philadelphia\n\nWells Fargo Center Philadelphia Date: Saturday, February 22nd\n\nSaturday, February 22nd Betting Odds EDM -192 | PHI +161 O/U 6\n\nThe Oilers Can Win If\u2026\n\nWith a 4-2 win over the Flames, the Oilers improved to 34-17-4. Edmonton covered the puck line as -1.5 goal favorites, and the total of 6 goals fell short of the 6.5 set before the game.\n\nEdmonton had four different players score in the game, including Zach Hyman, who broke a 2-2 tie with a goal in the third period. The Oilers scored the game\u2019s first goal just 20 seconds into the first period.\n\nEdmonton\u2019s offense found the net four times in their 4-2 win over Calgary, with four different players scoring. Leon Draisaitl opened the scoring just 20 seconds into the game, marking his 9th goal of the season. Jeff Skinner added his 3rd goal, while Zach Hyman, also with his 3rd of the year, scored on a power play. Mattias Janmark sealed the game with an empty-netter, his 2nd goal of the season.\n\nDraisaitl also contributed two assists, bringing his total to 8 for the season. The Oilers took 31 shots on goal and recorded 10 giveaways. Zach Hyman, who scored in the third period, now has 5 assists on the year.\n\nDefensively, the Oilers allowed the first goal at 4:33 into the 2nd period and another at 4:28 into the 3rd, but they held the Flames scoreless after that. Stuart Skinner finished with 29 saves and a 93.5% save percentage, while the defense added 2 takeaways and 19 hits.\n\nThe Oilers have posted a 2-1 record in their previous three games. However, they have only gone 0-3 vs. the puck line over this stretch. Their over-under record in these three games was 2-1.\n\nThrough their last ten regular season contests, Edmonton has a record of 5-5. In these contests, the team went just 2-8 against the spread, while going 4-6 on the over-under.\n\nThe Flyers Can Win If\u2026\n\nWith a 3-0 loss to the Bruins, the Flyers fell to 24-26-7 on the season. Philadelphia entered as underdogs on the puck line, and the total was set at 6.5 goals, but the combined score of 3 fell well short of that mark.\n\nDefensively, the Flyers struggled, allowing goals in each period. The Bruins\u2019 first goal came at 6:32 in the first period, and they added another in the second before sealing the win with an empty-net goal in the third.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s offense struggled in their 3-0 loss to Boston, managing just 20 shots on goal and failing to find the net. The Flyers were shut out for the first time in three games, with 15 giveaways contributing to their offensive woes.\n\nDespite their efforts, the Flyers couldn\u2019t capitalize on any scoring opportunities, remaining scoreless through all three periods. This marks the fifth time this season that Philadelphia has been held without a goal.\n\nDefensively, the Flyers gave up the first goal at 13:28 in the first period and another at 11:23 in the second. They conceded a third on an empty net late in the third. Samuel Ersson made 8 saves with a 100% save percentage after coming on, while the Flyers\u2019 defense recorded 5 takeaways and 30 hits.\n\nOver their last three regular season games, the Flyers have gone 1-2 straight up. This also includes going 2-1 ATS, and posting an over-under record of 1-2.\n\nThe Flyers have gone 3-7 over their last ten regular season games. Their record vs the puck line sits at 3-7 in these matchups, while posting a 3-7 over-under mark.\n\nThe Lean\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a moneyline pick, my choice is the Flyers to take down the Oilers at home. With the moneyline currently at +161, I\u2019m placing my bet on the Flyers straight-up.\n\nOur projections have the Flyers pulling out a win as the underdog. But if you\u2019re not as bullish as we are on the Flyers, we\u2019d recommend at least getting a bet down on them to cover the puck line.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking at the over/under line set at 6 goals, our prediction is that this game will exceed that mark, and we strongly advise placing a bet on the over.\n\nMcDavid Returns From 4 Nations Glory to Lead Edmonton\u2019s Playoff Push\n\nConnor McDavid doesn\u2019t have much time to bask in the glory of his 4 Nations Face-Off heroics. After scoring the overtime winner to lift Team Canada past the United States in Thursday night\u2019s championship game, the Edmonton Oilers\u2019 captain is back in NHL action on Saturday afternoon, leading his team against the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n\u201cObviously, it means a lot to our group,\u201d McDavid said after the tournament. \u201cI think a lot of people were wondering what this tournament would mean to guys, and obviously, you can see what it means to everyone on our side. It was really exciting.\u201d\n\nWith the international break now behind him, McDavid shifts his focus to helping the Oilers secure a playoff spot and push toward another Stanley Cup Final appearance. Last season, Edmonton reached Game 7 before falling to the Florida Panthers, leaving unfinished business for the team\u2019s core.\n\nOilers Open East Coast Road Trip\n\nThe Oilers enter the final stretch of the regular season with 27 games remaining and plenty to prove. They won two consecutive overtime games before the break but fell short in a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on Feb. 7. Leon Draisaitl and Corey Perry each scored twice to erase a two-goal deficit, but Colorado scored the game-winner late in the third period.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing the same way. We\u2019re looking to play a tight game. That\u2019s our identity,\u201d Draisaitl said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not going to change. But obviously, we didn\u2019t do that today. Too much offense given and it\u2019s just not a great loss for us.\u201d\n\nEdmonton now begins a crucial five-game East Coast road trip, with matchups against Washington, Tampa Bay, Florida, and Carolina\u2014all among the top teams in the Eastern Conference. First, however, is a showdown with the Flyers at Wells Fargo Center.\n\nFlyers Aim to Build on Pre-Break Victory\n\nThe Flyers enter the post-break stretch looking to improve their playoff standing after a rough patch before the hiatus. Philadelphia had lost seven of eight games (1-6-1) before earning a much-needed 3-2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Feb. 8. Goaltender Samuel Ersson made 31 saves, while Travis Konecny contributed a goal and an assist to help secure the victory.\n\n\u201cIt was huge. It changes your mindset completely,\u201d Konecny said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play a perfect game. We could have done a lot of things differently. But \u2018Ers\u2019 helped us out a ton. That gives us some confidence going into the break here.\u201d\n\nBoth Konecny and Ersson represented their countries at the 4 Nations Face-Off. Konecny, playing for Team Canada, was a healthy scratch in the championship game, while Ersson served as one of Sweden\u2019s goaltenders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s big for me, obviously, to not just be a part of the tournament but to also get a game and get to play,\u201d Ersson said. \u201cIt was very fun and a big experience for me.\u201d\n\nSeason Series and McDavid\u2019s Dominance Against Flyers\n\nSaturday\u2019s matchup marks the second and final meeting between the Oilers and Flyers this season. Edmonton won the first contest on Oct. 15, rallying from a 2-0 deficit to claim a 4-3 victory in overtime, with Draisaitl scoring the game-winner.\n\nMcDavid has consistently thrived against Philadelphia, recording a point in 11 consecutive games against the Flyers. In 16 career games against Philadelphia, McDavid has amassed 11 goals and 22 assists, underscoring his ability to produce against this opponent.\n\nExplore the Latest NHL Expert Picks and Data-Driven Analysis to Boost Your Betting Strategy\n\nPlayoff Implications and Key Players to Watch\n\nWith the playoff race heating up, both teams are looking to gain momentum as they head into the final stretch of the regular season. For the Oilers, McDavid\u2019s scoring touch, Draisaitl\u2019s offensive consistency, and Perry\u2019s veteran presence will be crucial as they navigate a challenging schedule. On the Flyers\u2019 side, Konecny\u2019s scoring, Ersson\u2019s goaltending, and contributions from their young core will be key to securing points down the stretch.\n\nAs McDavid looks to carry his international success into NHL play and the Oilers begin their push toward postseason contention, Saturday\u2019s clash in Philadelphia promises to be a high-stakes battle with playoff implications for both teams.",

            "content": "Wells Fargo has finally revealed its plans to enter the digital advice market.\n\nThe recently embattled bank announced a new partnership Tuesday with SigFig, a technology company based based in San Francisco, to develop a new robo advisory offering for Wells Fargo Advisors.\n\nLike other robo advisors, the technology is designed to be a low-cost offering for younger, emerging investors. The platform will automatically create a portfolio based on an investor\u2019s answers to a questionnaire. Investors can then add funds electronically, and algorithms will automatically rebalance holdings, removing the need for a traditional financial advisor. The robo's investment strategy will come from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nWells Fargo plans to launch a pilot program in 2017. Though it is a direct-to-consumer offering, Wells Fargo advisors will be able to offer the robo as a complementary offering to the existing business. The go-to-market strategy is still in development, but Wells Fargo plans to leverage internal channels to offer it broadly to Wells Fargo customers.\n\nThe hope, according to David Carroll, the head of wealth and investment management at the firm, is that by delivering digital advice to the next generation of investors, Wells Fargo can establish a long-term pipeline for its full-service advisory business.\n\nWells Fargo has hinted at its plans to introduce a robo advisor for several months now, but kept vague as to whether it would develop a product in-house, acquire an existing company, or partner with a technology developer.\n\n\u201cExperience and partnerships are some of our strongest attributes,\u201d Carroll said in a statement. \u201cWe have an opportunity to serve clients more holistically with a product that complements our full-service business by combining the investment strategy of Wells Fargo with sophisticated investing technology, mobile tools and intuitive design.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t SigFig\u2019s first partnership with a bank. In May, UBS announced an equity investment in SigFig to help develop customized digital tools for its wealth management division and create a research and development lab.\n\n\u201cInvestors are increasingly demanding improved digital experiences, making it vital that financial institutions invest more resources and incorporate more technology in their offerings,\" said Mike Sha, SigFig\u2019s CEO.\n\nSpeaking to WealthManagement.com, Sha added that technology startup companies like SigFig can large-firm innovate quicker by testing new features on a smaller group of customers before scaling it to the institutional level. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a much bigger trend in the industry: large financial institutions working with smaller, younger, more nimble companies to help accelerate the capabilities set.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Americans don\u2019t have enough wealth to have a Wells Fargo advisor. Digital advice gives access to advice at a good price point,\" Sha said. \u201cThis is just a huge, unmet need.\u201d\n\nOnce antagonistic to the wealth management industry, robo advisors are increasingly looking to be technology providers rather than strictly direct-to-consumer players. Betterment, for example, offers a white-label version of its product for financial advisors and has shifted into the 401(k) market with Betterment for Business. Other companies like Jemstep and Vanare are strictly business-to-business providers. Wealthfront is one of the only robos to remain exclusively a direct-to-consumer business.\n\n\u201cIt looks like SigFig has figured out the massive enterprise sale cycle and business model,\u201d said Lex Sokolin, the global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research and former COO of Vanare. \u201cIt\u2019s also notable that the offering will be direct-to-consumer, similar to what Bank of America is doing with its internally built tool. That makes a statement by Wells Fargo about the role of advisors in the future of wealth management.\u201d\n\nSokolin suggested that a self-directed model might be a good look for Wells Fargo\u2019s image, which was recently tarnished in a massive account-opening scandal that led to 5,300 employees fired and the retirement of CEO John Stumpf. Sokolin also wondered if partnerships like this prove whether or not large financial institutions are capable of innovating internally. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have both announced plans to build their own robos.\n\nDevon McConnell, Wells Fargo Advisor\u2019s head of digital, said that the decision to partner with SigFig, rather than develop a robo internally or acquire a company, was made to bring the product to the market as quickly as possible. She added that this project has been in development for some time, and trying to bring something to market quickly is not linked with recent events at Wells Fargo.\n\nWealthManagement.com updated this article with responses from Wells Fargo and SigFig.",

            "content": "It has happened again. A Cuban-American resident of South Florida is searching for answers after Wells Fargo blocked their bank account without warning.\n\nThe affected individual, identified as Jos\u00e9 Antonio Orta, reported in statements to Telemundo 51 that he found out on January 29 when, while attempting to make a payment, he was informed that the card was blocked and had been canceled.\n\nWhen he went to the bank branch for explanations, they told him that they needed documentation.\n\n\"I took them, and it's absurd because they have had that documentation for a very long time. Moreover, it's documentation that doesn't expire. Once you become a citizen, you cease to be a citizen only when you die,\" said Orta, who is a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe decision to block the account left Jos\u00e9 Antonio Orta perplexed, as he believes the bank had other alternatives to verify his history.\n\n\"If it was to check a transaction, looking at my account would have been enough. They didn't have to block me. Who better than them to know what I buy, spend, or what I do with my account?\" he questions.\n\nThe Cuban claims that he never received any notification from the bank and that it was he who had to make multiple calls to find out about the situation.\n\nThe suspension of your account lasted for 17 days, affecting your scheduled payments.\n\n\"I need to see what will happen now with American Express, with FPL, with all the accounts scheduled to automatically debit from my bank account, which couldn\u2019t do anything because my account was blocked,\" he concluded.\n\nThis episode is part of a series of measures that Wells Fargo has implemented in recent months, which have affected customers from sanctioned countries, such as Cuba.\n\nThe issue dates back to December 2023, when the first cases began to come to light.\n\nSince then, there has been a persistent demand for answers from the banking institution, but to date, the company has declined to comment on the number of affected customers and the length of this review process.\n\nThe company justifies the review as a necessary measure to comply with regulations from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which requires financial institutions to verify the immigration status of clients from countries under economic sanctions, such as Cuba.\n\nThe response from Wells Fargo\n\nIn response to the growing concern and dissatisfaction of affected clients, the banking institution issued a statement.\n\n\"While we do not disclose details about specific banking relationships, we can share that our bankers do everything possible to assist affected clients and minimize their inconvenience. We are committed to providing transparency in our process and clear communication to our clients. In this case, once we received all the required documentation, we resolved the matter for our client,\" they stated.\n\nFinancial institutions, including Wells Fargo, typically have established protocols for notifying their clients when it is necessary to update documents. Usually, these notices are sent by mail or electronically, and a period of approximately 30 days is granted to comply with the requirements.\n\nHowever, these recent cases have highlighted the need for clients to stay alert to any official communication from the bank.\n\nAs more cases emerge and uncertainty grows, many Cuban-American clients in the United States are wondering if their accounts might be at risk, and are demanding greater clarity from Wells Fargo regarding these procedures.\n\nAt the beginning of December 2023, it was reported that two Cuban-Americans who own the bar Cubata, located in Little Havana, had been unable to pay their employees and suppliers because Wells Fargo had frozen their bank accounts.\n\nDuring those same days, the case of a Wells Fargo branch in Hialeah emerged, which unexpectedly froze the accounts of a Cuban permanent resident in the U.S. since the 1990s and his wife, a citizen originally from the United States.",

Cardholders earn the stellar 4% rate on a diverse set of merchants, from florists and bowling alleys to movie theaters, antique stores and much more.\n\nMerchant category codes, or MCCs \u2014 four-digit codes that classify a business according to its goods or services \u2014 are key to how much you\u2019ll earn with the Attune card. For example, the card earns 4% bonus cash rewards at secondhand stores, which are classified under the MCC 5931. As long as the payment network (which for this card is Visa) has categorized your favorite thrift store under that MCC, you should be rewarded for shopping there with 4% cash back.\n\nRewards may be redeemed for cash, charitable donations, merchandise, gift cards and travel, or used to pay off purchases through the Pay with Rewards program.\n\nFlexible, transferable points\n\nEarnings from the Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card come in the form of Wells Fargo Rewards and may be transferred to other Wells Fargo Rewards-earning cards such as the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card. That means you can combine rewards from multiple Wells Fargo cards into one pot. And if you have both the Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card and a Wells Fargo travel card \u2014 such as the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card or Wells Fargo Autograph Journey\u2120 Card \u2014 the rewards you earn with the Attune can be moved to those cards\u2019 accounts and then transferred to one of Wells Fargo\u2019s travel partners.\n\nNo late fees\n\nThe Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card is rare among its peers in that it doesn\u2019t charge late fees. Note, however, that card issuers typically report payments more than 30 days late to the major credit bureaus, which can cause credit scores to drop.\n\nInsurance coverage\n\nLike some of the issuer's other credit cards, the Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card offers cell phone insurance on up to two $600 claims per 12-month period. A $25 deductible is required, and cardholders must pay their cell phone bill with the Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card to qualify.\n\nCardholders also get rental car insurance up to $50,000 when they pay for the rental with their Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card .\n\n0% intro APR period on purchases",

It dealt with the company's auto lending and mortgage practices, and its compliance risk management program.\n\nEarlier this month, WFC confirmed that the Federal Reserve board of governors terminated two longstanding consent orders \u2014 a 2011 consent order regarding the company\u2019s legacy mortgage servicing activities and a 2011 consent order regarding its legacy Wells Fargo Financial business.\n\nIn November 2024, Reuters reported WFC to be in the final stages of meeting its regulatory requirements to remove the $1.95-trillion asset cap. This asset cap was imposed in 2018 following the revelation of its fake account scandal. Per the report, the asset cap could be removed in the first half of 2025, provided the bank resolves its risk management and compliance issues. The decision to lift the restriction would require voting from the Federal Reserve's board of governors.\n\nBecause of the asset cap, the company is unable to grow to its potential. This is affecting its loan growth. Given that loans are among the largest assets a bank can hold, lifting the asset cap will mark a turning point for Wells Fargo.",

            "content": "Builder sentiment fell sharply in February over concerns on tariffs, elevated mortgage rates and high housing costs.\n\nBuilder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes was 42 in February, down five points from January and the lowest level in five months, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today.\n\n\u201cWhile builders hold out hope for pro-development policies, particularly for regulatory reform, policy uncertainty and cost factors created a reset for 2025 expectations in the most recent HMI,\u201d said NAHB Chairman Carl Harris, a custom home builder from Wichita, Kan. \u201cUncertainty on the tariff front helped push builders\u2019 expectations for future sales volume down to the lowest level since December 2023. Incentive use may also be weakening as a sales strategy as elevated interest rates reduce the pool of eligible home buyers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith 32% of appliances and 30% of softwood lumber coming from international trade, uncertainty over the scale and scope of tariffs has builders further concerned about costs,\u201d said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. \u201cReflecting this outlook, builder responses collected prior to a pause for the proposed tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico yielded a lower HMI reading of 38, while those collected after the announced one-month pause produced a score of 44. Addressing the elevated pace of shelter inflation requires bending the housing cost curve to enable adding more attainable housing.\u201d\n\nThe latest HMI survey also revealed that 26% of builders cut home prices in February, down from 30% in January and the lowest share since May 2024. Meanwhile, the average price reduction was 5% in February, the same rate as the previous month. The use of sales incentives was 59% in February, down from 61% in January.\n\nDerived from a monthly survey that NAHB has been conducting for more than 35 years, the NAHB/Wells Fargo HMI gauges builder perceptions of current single-family home sales and sales expectations for the next six months as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d The survey also asks builders to rate traffic of prospective buyers as \u201chigh to very high,\u201d \u201caverage\u201d or \u201clow to very low.\u201d Scores for each component are then used to calculate a seasonally adjusted index where any number over 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor.\n\nAll three of the major HMI indices posted losses in February. The HMI index gauging current sales conditions fell four points to 46, the component measuring sales expectations in the next six months plunged 13 points to 46, and the gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers posted a three-point decline to 29.\n\nLooking at the three-month moving averages for regional HMI scores, the Northeast fell three points in February to 57, the Midwest moved two points lower to 45, the West edged one-point lower to 39 and the South held steady at 46.\n\nHMI tables can be found at nahb.org/hmi.

It is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector founded in 2011 after the Great Recession. Fox - Seattle\n\nThe Wells Fargo banking branch in downtown Sioux Falls will close in order to consolidate office and branch spaces \u2014 but major redevelopment may be on the horizon next year.\n\nLocal real estate agent David Shelton has plans to revamp the area with offices, residents, a hotel tower and grocery and retail establishments. While plans are still being finalized and likely will be announced next year, Shelton said he has initial clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration to build up to 220 feet, allowing for an 18-to-20-story tower.\n\n\u201cThis will be a transformational project for downtown Sioux Falls,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the future and the opportunities it will bring to the city.\u201d\n\nWhat's happening to Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo spokesperson Staci Schiller said although bank branches remain an important part of customer service, banking habits have evolved from in-person to digital tools such as the app, website and ATMs.\n\nIn turn, this has resulted in less foot traffic to physical banks. Wells Fargo needs to continue to adapt to how people are banking today to best meet the needs of the community, Schiller said.\n\n\u201cAnd in this case, if the branch isn't getting utilized as much because people are changing the way they bank and just doing different behaviors, we're able to deploy our resources elsewhere,\u201d Schiller said.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s downtown Sioux Falls branch temporarily closed in February last year due to staffing challenges caused by the city\u2019s low unemployment rate. At the time, the bank was actively hiring and onboarding new employees.\n\nThe Wells Fargo downtown branch at 101 N. Phillips Ave. will close May 7.\n\nFor now, the downtown Wells Fargo ATM will remain at its current location. After the downtown branch closes, the Colonial bank branch at 26th Street and South Minnesota Avenue is the next closest location as one of the seven remaining Wells Fargo banking branches in Sioux Falls and one in Brandon.\n\nSchiller said Wells Fargo is \u201cmaking every attempt\u201d to place branch employees at other Wells Fargo locations.\n\nAdministrative, commercial banking and wealth team staff already have moved to their new space at the former Bancorp building at 69th Street and Western Avenue. Other employees will either work remotely or at the bank\u2019s Sioux Falls Operations Center at 3201 N. Fourth Ave. near North Minnesota Avenue.\n\nThe Operations Center also will serve as Wells Fargo\u2019s new main office after the downtown branch closes in the spring.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we are keeping our main office in Sioux Falls speaks to our level of investment, engagement and commitment to the market, and that Sioux Falls remains an important location for Wells Fargo,\u201d Schiller said.\n\nLast year, many Wells Fargo employees were concerned that the multinational financial company would be eliminating a significant number of positions in Sioux Falls, later deciding to recommit most of its workforce in the city, Schiller said.\n\n\u201cSioux Falls is a really important location for us, and we want to continue to employ folks here in Sioux Falls and just concentrate some of our other real estate investments in fewer locations,\u201d Schiller said.\n\nSchiller said the Wells Fargo branch located south of 57th Street and Cliff Avenue was recently refurbished, and she hopes this will also be the case for other Sioux Falls-area branches in the near future.\n\nWhat will happen to the downtown property?\n\nAs for what awaits the downtown Wells Fargo building lot, Shelton, who also is a broker for Century 21 Advantage, said those plans will be finalized once Wells Fargo\u2019s lease ends in December.\n\n\u201cOnce Wells Fargo moves out, we\u2019ll meet with existing tenants to decide on the best path forward with the existing building,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cOur intention is to develop the north part of the site first this summer, where the current parking ramp and surface lots are.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo has anchored the downtown building since 1973. A new owner named Roland Johnson or R.H. Johnson invested in the office building in 2013.\n\nIn 2015, Shelton's ambitious redevelopment of the 2.6-acre Wells Fargo lot was one of three Request for Proposals (RFP) for parking with the city of Sioux Falls. The city selected a different RFP, which, in the end, only ever produced a new parking ramp.\n\nTen years later, the vision Shelton proposed, with some adjustments, is finally seeing the light of day with a mixed-used redevelopment project on the corner of Ninth Street and Phillips Avenue, a site that is considered \u201ca major development opportunity with major impact\u201d in the city\u2019s 2035 Downtown Sioux Falls Plan.\n\nShelton said they would likely build a new office building, potentially including office space and residential units, along with a hotel tower and grocery and retail establishments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to build what isn\u2019t currently available in Sioux Falls but is in growing demand,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cThis project is designed to last the next 100 years, emphasizing low energy consumption and luxury accommodations.\u201d\n\nShelton said even back in 2015 they were actively pursuing Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Foods, which continues to this day. The hurdle Shelton said they would need to overcome is the state of South Dakota\u2019s alcohol distribution requirements, as Trader Joe\u2019s self-distributes.\n\nThe proposed redevelopment could also include interactive elements to enhance the downtown experience, such as video walls that integrate with the Sculpture Walk.",

            "content": "The Zelle logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. (Nikolas Kokovlis / Associated Press)\n\nWells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America are being sued by the embattled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over alleged unchecked fraud on the Zelle payment app \u2014 setting up a legal showdown that the incoming Trump administration could quash as soon as next month.\n\nThe three financial institutions, which co-own the app along with four other large banks, were accused in a lawsuit filed Friday of rushing to launch the service in 2017 to compete with popular payment apps such as Venmo without putting in place proper consumer safeguards. The result, according to the lawsuit, was fraud-related losses of more than $870 million over the last seven years.\n\n\"Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said.\n\nThe 91-page federal lawsuit, which seeks an injunction to prevent future violations of law and monetary relief including restitution, claims that hundreds of thousands of consumers at the three banks made complaints about being defrauded but \"were largely denied relief, and some were even told to try getting their money back by contacting the person who had defrauded them.\" The CFPB said the three banks accounted for 73% of Zelle activity last year.\n\nRead more:Overdraft fees would be slashed under new Biden administration rule. What you need to know\n\nEarly Warning Services, which operates the app on behalf of the banks, attacked the lawsuit as \"legally and factually flawed\" and claimed the suit could be counterproductive by \"incentivizing\" criminals to make bogus fraud claims that institutions would have to pay \u2014 raising the app's costs and driving away credit unions and community and minority-owned banks offering Zelle. Some 2,200 financial institutions use the service.\n\n\"Zelle is relied upon by 143 million enrolled American consumers and small businesses, and we are fully prepared to defend this meritless lawsuit to ensure their service does not suffer,\" said Jane Khodos, a spokesperson for Early Warning, which was also named as a defendant.\n\nBank of America, in its own statement, said that \"more than 99.95 percent of transactions across the Zelle network go through without incident. When a client has an issue, we work directly with them.\"\n\nJP Morgan Chase also denied the allegations and alluded to political overtones raised by Early Warning, saying the CFPB's action was a \"last ditch effort in pursuit of their political agenda.\" Wells Fargo did not return messages requesting comment.\n\nThe CFPB, established in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has long been criticized by Republicans as a \"runaway\" agency whose actions are heavy-handed and stifle economic growth.\n\nThe first administration of Donald Trump sought to rein in the bureau and redrafted proposed rules aimed at tightening regulations on payday lenders. Consumer advocates considered the final regulations watered down. The new Trump administration could terminate the Zelle lawsuit when it takes power next month.\n\nSome critics want to abolish the agency altogether. Billionaire Elon Musk, who is leading an effort to streamline the federal government through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, criticized the agency in a November post on X that said, \"Delete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court turned down an effort by a payday lending trade group to declare the bureau's structure unconstitutional because it is funded by bank fees instead of congressional appropriations.\n\nRead more:FTC lawsuit accuses L.A. cash app Dave of charging hidden fees\n\nThe bureau, which boasts it has gotten consumers more than $21 billion in relief, has stepped up its enforcement actions recently ahead of the change in administrations.\n\nOn Monday, it filed separate lawsuits against Walmart and Rocket Mortgage over alleged financial wrongdoing. And earlier this month it issued landmark rules that could lower the costs of bank overdrafts to as little as $5.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Trade Commission, led by outgoing Chair Lina Khan, sued Los Angeles cash app company Dave Inc. last month, accusing it of misleading its financially vulnerable customers about fees it charges and the amount of money it gives out. The company denies the allegations.\n\nThe CFPB in its lawsuit claims that without adequate safeguards, Zelle allows fraudsters to create multiple email addresses and mobile phone numbers in signing up for the service that can be linked to the same or different bank accounts, leaving consumers unaware of who they are sending their money to.\n\nIt claims the banks allowed repeat offenders to hop between banks, with the banks not sharing information about fraudsters and acting too slowly to restrict or track criminals. It also claimed that they did not act on the hundreds of thousands of complaints they received to prevent further fraud.\n\nIn response, Early Warning claimed it has \"highly effective multi-layered fraud and scam prevention measures\" that in 2023 resulted in reports of frauds and scams decreasing by nearly 50% despite a 27% increase in transaction volume.\n\nThe company said it had made \"every effort to engage and cooperate\" with the bureau before the lawsuit was filed, which it said is part of the agency's \"pattern and practice of regulatory overreach.\"\n\nThe bureau's lawsuit was applauded by the National Consumer Law Center, which said, \u201cThe CFPB is standing up for people who weren\u2019t able to get the big banks to take their claims of fraud seriously and return their hard-earned money. The CFPB helps ordinary people who\u2019ve been hurt by big banks.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, who spearheaded the creation of the agency, came to its defense last week and called on Trump to work with the agency to help American families by temporarily capping credit card interest rates at 10% \u2014 a pledge he made on the campaign trail.\n\n\"That would be a real boost for millions of families across this country,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said. \"If he's true to his word here, and I think we ought to take them at his word, then the CFPB can help him do that.\"\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

While the broader financial sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, certain stocks within the group appear even better positioned for growth. The broader market\u2019s financial sector has climbed nearly 30% this year, surpassing the overall market and even outperforming the technology sector, which includes many of the high-profile mega-cap tech stocks. The financial index is up by over 7% since the start of 2025.\n\nThe US banking sector continued to expand in the third quarter of 2024, despite sluggish loan growth. The industry saw a 1.4% sequential increase in total assets during the period. Collectively, the 50 largest US banks added $377.22 billion in aggregate assets during the third quarter, with 35 institutions reporting growth, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. This marked a turnaround from the second quarter when the top 50 banks saw a combined decline of $128.01 billion from the first quarter of the year. The report further mentioned that as of September 30, the total assets of the 50 largest US banks stood at $23.985 trillion. Among the 39 banks with assets ranging from $50 billion to $500 billion, 25 recorded an increase in assets during the third quarter.\n\nAlso read: 10 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now\n\nFinancial stocks experienced a sharp and widespread rally following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. This surge was largely fueled by market optimism surrounding a potentially more relaxed regulatory environment in 2025, particularly in relation to mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence climbed to 13.4%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 5.9% gain.\n\nAnother key factor influencing bank performance was the Federal Reserve\u2019s release of parameters for its annual industry stress test. The 2025 test outlined less severe economic shocks than previous years, although it still projected a rise in U.S. unemployment to 10% and a 33% decline in home prices. Compared to prior tests, the latest scenario included milder increases in joblessness and less drastic drops in stock and real estate values. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg emphasized these adjustments in his report, \u201c2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.\u201d Meanwhile, Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala suggested that the test\u2019s reduced stringency and greater predictability could lead banks to hold smaller capital buffers later in the year.\n\nThe financial sector is cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. The US economy has maintained steady momentum, increasing the likelihood of a \u201csoft landing\u201d\u2014a scenario that would help ease concerns about a potential mild recession that could weigh on financial stocks. According to analysts, a key shift heading into 2025 compared to previous years is the outlook for interest rates. The second half of 2024 marked the start of a new rate cycle, with the Federal Reserve implementing its first rate cut since the early stages of the pandemic. For banks, interest rate changes present both opportunities and challenges. While higher rates can boost net interest margins, rate fluctuations can also impact lending activity and overall profitability.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm for financial stocks is on the rise, driven in large part by their appealing dividend payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the financial sector saw headline growth of 7.7% growth in dividend payouts on a YoY basis. The report also mentioned that the industry paid $72 billion in dividends in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. The stocks mentioned below also offer stable dividend yields. From the resultant list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment towards them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a financial services company, based in California. While consumer banking continues to be the company\u2019s primary source of revenue, its investment banking division is becoming an important driver of growth, with investment banking fees surging 59% year over year in the latest quarter.\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported $20.3 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024, showing a slight 0.5% decline from the same period the previous year. However, net income rose significantly to $5.07 billion, up from $3.4 billion a year earlier. The company saw strong growth in fee-based revenue, which increased 15% year over year, helping offset the expected decline in net interest income. Operating expenses were lower than the prior year, while credit trends remained stable. Wells Fargo also maintained a solid capital position, closing the year with an 11.1% CET1 ratio.\n\nOn January 28, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders since 1988, which places it on our list of the best financial sector dividend stocks.

In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wells Fargo.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo\n\nNYSE:WFC Ownership Breakdown February 15th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWells Fargo already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Wells Fargo's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNYSE:WFC Earnings and Revenue Growth February 15th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power.

With 7.8% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.",

            "content": "Stock image.\n\nFort Lauderdale, FL\u2014 Attorneys this week debated whether Wells Fargo mismanaged a massive trust fund intended for thousands of children who are members of Florida\u2019s Seminole Tribe, as trial opened against the banking giant. Gopher, et al. v. Wells Fargo, et al.\n\nAt the heart of the case is a trust created for the benefit of minor members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, using revenue from the Tribe\u2019s casino operations. Wells Fargo, as successor-in-interest to Wachovia Bank, acted as trustee from 2005 until it resigned from the position in 2016. Plaintiffs, including the current trustee and others, claim Wells Fargo charged millions of dollars in improper fees and mismanaged the trust fund investments, leading to hundreds of millions more in damages.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s openings, Conrad & Scherer\u2019s Steven Osber told jurors that the banking giant charged unauthorized fees to the trust for years, which amounted to \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d on the fee charges.\n\nHe also contended that the bank did not follow the \u201cprudent investor rule\u201d when investing trust funds, failing to invest in stocks or otherwise properly diversify the trust\u2019s portfolio. Osber said evidence would show that when Wells Fargo discovered their actions, they improperly amended the trust to cover up the mismanagement.\n\nInterested in watching this trial LIVE?\n\nEmail rlaw@cvn.com\n\nfor more information.\n\n\u201cThe trustee knew the rules, they ignored the rules, they broke the rules, they breached their fiduciary duties to the minors,\u201d Osber said. \u201cAnd they caused significant damages to the minors\u2019 trust.\u201d\n\nConrad & Scherer\u2019s Irwin Gilbert added that evidence would show that the trust suffered more than $800 million in damages from the faulty investment strategy and more than $7 million from the unauthorized charges.\n\nBut Wells Fargo contends it acted according to the trust\u2019s overarching terms. During his opening statement Thursday, Winston & Strawn\u2019s Thomas Melsheimer said the trust was established with the primary goal of protecting and preserving trust assets, requiring a conservative approach in investments.\n\nMelsheimer said this approach was fueled by the Seminole Tribe\u2019s loss of stock market investments years earlier, which colored its approach to the trust.\n\nAnd while Melsheimer acknowledged that some fees charged for servicing the trust had not been published on a fee schedule as required, he pushed back on claims that the fees were imposed in bad faith, telling jurors the bank returned more than $1 million of those charges.\n\nMelsheimer added that the trust itself provided that Wells Fargo and its agents could only be liable if they committed willful malfeasance or acted in bad faith.\n\n\u201cThis is not a case about whether Wells Fargo made a mistake or acted negligently, or that another trustee might have done things differently,\u201d Melsheimer said.\n\nTrial in the case is expected to run as long as six weeks.\n\nEmail Arlin Crisco at acrisco@cvn.com.\n\nRelated information.\n\nWatch the trial.\n\nNot a subscriber?\n\nLearn how you can access an unrivaled trial video library.",

            "content": "Angus Mordant/Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo has been released from another consent order, marking the fourth regulatory action the bank has shaken off in the last month.\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency terminated a six-year-old consent order related to Wells' compliance risk management program, the company said on Thursday. While the bank has picked up its pace of shedding consent orders , it still remains shackled under the most titanic penalty \u2014 a February 2018 order from the Federal Reserve that caps Wells' assets at $1.9 trillion.\n\nThe latest order to be terminated, which came down on the bank in April 2018, was accompanied by a $500 million fine. It dealt with Wells' auto lending and mortgage practices, in addition to its compliance risk management program. In coordination with the OCC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed its own consent order related to similar practices, fining the bank $1 billion, $500 million of which was credited to the OCC to cover the agency's penalty.\n\nThe related consent order from the CFPB remains outstanding.\n\nIn 2018, the OCC mandated that Wells develop a plan to overhaul its compliance risk management systems, its insurance policies for car loans and fee practices for mortgages. Three years later, the agency fined Wells $250 million for making insufficient progress on remediation, and it put limits on the bank's future activities until its mortgage servicing policies were addressed.\n\nThe bank has been under the regulatory microscope for nearly a decade as it has reckoned with myriad scandals related to its retail sales practices and risk control infrastructure.\n\nCEO Charlie Scharf, who was brought on in 2019 to whip the bank's compliance into shape, said in a prepared statement on Thursday that \"many thousands of people\" have worked \"tirelessly to transform the company.\" He also said that the recent spate of consent order terminations represents a \"huge accomplishment.\"\n\n\"We are a different company today than when the new management team arrived,\" Scharf said. \"We remain focused and confident in our ability to complete the work required in our remaining consent orders, while building one of the most respected financial institutions in the country.\"\n\nThe OCC's 2018 order hit the bank at a turbulent time in its relationship with regulators. The then-unprecedented asset cap had been slapped on the bank only two months prior. According to a 2020 report by the Democratic staff of the House Financial Services Committee, Wells had attempted to influence the wording of the OCC's press release to soften the language regarding the removal of bank directors and management.\n\nTim Sloan, then the CEO of Wells Fargo , was eventually ousted , apparently due at least in part to congressional testimony he gave in 2019 claiming the bank was in compliance with the OCC's April 2018 order. The House Democrats' report called Sloan's statements misleading and inaccurate.\n\nRegulators have now closed 10 consent orders with Wells since 2019, while four more remain outstanding. But progress hasn't been entirely linear. The bank entered an agreement with the OCC in September 2024 that flagged \"deficiencies\" in Wells' anti-money-laundering program.\n\nKeith Horowitz, an analyst at Citigroup, said in a research note on Thursday that the recent removal of numerous consent orders validates Scharf's regulatory and risk management priorities and the bank's progress.\n\nEarlier this month, Wells Fargo cleared a pair of orders from the Fed that dated back to 2011 and related to deficiencies in its mortgage lending practices. In January, the bank was freed from a 2022 consent order with the CFPB.\n\nWells Fargo Wells Fargo exits consent order. Is more regulatory progress coming? Analysts say the termination of a 2022 consent order with the CFPB is a sign that the bank's days under an asset cap may be numbered. But the consumer bureau, still led by Director Rohit Chopra, says Wells is still being scrutinized as a repeat offender. January 28\n\nThe CFPB said last month that although its 2022 action was terminated, Wells remained \"a repeat offender that continues to have serious issues.\" At the time, Rohit Chopra, a Biden administration appointee, was still the CFPB's director.\n\nNow Chopra has been fired, and in the last two weeks, the Trump administration has taken steps to effectively defang the bureau , firing dozens of employees and ordering staff to stop all work.\n\nScott Siefers, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote in a Thursday note that the termination of the 2018 consent order is significant, but the most significant takeaway involves the pace at which various regulatory orders have been resolved.\n\n\"Each of these terminations represents another important step forward in [Wells'] broader regulatory remediation efforts,\" Siefers said.\n\nHorowitz was less optimistic, writing that the acceleration of terminations was good news, but arguing that \"it's difficult to read into the pace too much given each agency controls the review and termination timeline.\"",

            "content": "There is a lot of uncertainty in the markets these days, but for fixed-income investors who remain agile, there could also be several opportunities, according to Wells Fargo. Bond yields remain elevated as investors grapple with uncertainty around the direction of interest rates and inflation . The yield on the 10-year Treasury is currently around 4.47%. Yields move inversely to prices. After cutting last year, the Federal Reserve opted to leave rates unchanged in January. The majority of market participants don't think the central bank will lower again for several months, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before Congress that \" we're not quite there yet \" in reducing inflation to its 2% target. To take advantage of the opportunities arising amid the uncertainty, Wells Fargo suggests remaining active and implementing defensive and growth-oriented fixed-income strategies concurrently. \"Ultra-short-term securities may appear attractive, but those opportunities diminish if the Fed eventually cuts policy rates further, while longer-term securities can be exposed to interest-rate risk if inflation and hotter economic growth force the Fed to raise rates further,\" global fixed income specialist Luis Alvarado wrote in a note Monday. Here are six key opportunities, according to Alvarado. U.S. intermediate-term taxable bonds These bonds, which have maturities of three to seven years, strike a balance between yield and price volatility, Alvarado said. They currently have attractive yields and, historically, tend to be less rate sensitive, which is important if rates increase, he noted. \"This asset class may provide investors with opportunities to outperform cash, cash alternatives, and U.S. Short Term Taxable Fixed Income in the near term,\" he wrote. U.S. long-term taxable bonds Alvarado favors bonds that have a 10-year or more time horizon over short-term bonds, although he has a neutral rating on them. \"Consider targeting long-term bonds and being favorable duration (a measure of interest rate sensitivity) in an effort to take advantage of yield steepness on the long end of the curve now that the Fed appears to be on pause in its interest rate-cutting cycle,\" he said. Investment-grade corporate bonds Credit spreads are tight, meaning they are expensive, but the higher yields relative to other investment-grade fixed-income sectors make them a favorable investment, Alvarado said. He advises investors to do a sound credit analysis before buying the assets. The focus should be on selectivity among issuers and sectors and pay close attention to liquidity and high quality, he added. Select securitized products Residential mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities both offer value relative to other fixed-income investments, while providing favorable credit quality and liquidity, Alvarado said. \"Furthermore, we believe an advantage of RMBS over IG [investment-grade] corporates remains visible in credit-spread differential,\" he said. \"Demand for ABS remains particularly strong, and although credit spreads have compressed in the past few months, we believe they have room to tighten further.\" Emerging market fixed income Both U.S.-dollar and local currency emerging-market sovereign bonds should continue to have positive performance in the near term, but most of that support should come on the back of additional Fed rate cuts, Alvarado said. \"Still, the attractive yield differential of EM bonds may provide greater currency resilience and a cushion against capital losses if interest rates climb once again, or if credit spreads widen,\" he said. Municipal bonds Fundamentals remain attractive in municipal bonds , Alvarado said. While there may be attractive yield opportunities in other fixed-income sectors, munis still have an important role in the portfolio for high-income investors, he said. The bonds are free of federal tax and are exempt from state tax if the investor resides in the bond's issuing state.",

            "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Wells Fargo (WFC). Shares have added about 3.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Wells Fargo due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nWells Fargo Q4 Earnings Beat on Higher Fee Income\n\nWells Fargo reported its fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $1.42, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $1.29.\n\nResults have benefited from higher non-interest income. An improvement in capital ratios, a decline in provisions and non-interest expenses were other positives. However, the decrease in net interest income (NII) was the undermining factor.\n\nResults exclude net losses of 25 cents per share on debt securities related to a repositioning of the investment securities portfolio and severance expenses, and net earnings of 26 cents per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period matters. After considering it, net income (GAAP basis) was $5.08 billion, which increased 47% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nIn 2024, earnings of $5.37 per share surpassed the consensus estimate of $5.29 and rose from $4.83 in 2023. Net income was $19.72 billion, up 3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s Revenues & Expenses Decline\n\nQuarterly total revenues were $20.38 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.55 billion. Also, the top line decreased 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor 2024, total revenues were $82.29 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $82.62 billion. Also, the top line declined 0.4% year over year.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s NII was $11.83 billion, down 7% year over year. The metric was affected by deposit mix and pricing changes, the impacts of lower rates on floating rate assets, and lower loan balances, partially offset by lower market funding.\n\nThe net interest margin (on a taxable-equivalent basis) declined year over year to 2.70% from 2.92%.\n\nNon-interest income grew 11% year over year to $8.54 billion. The uptick was driven by improved results from the company\u2019s venture capital investments, an increase in asset-based fees in Wealth and Investment Management on higher market valuations, and higher investment banking fees, as well as increases in most other fee categories, partially offset by net losses on debt securities related to a repositioning of the investment portfolio and lower net gains from trading in the Markets business.",

            "content": "The National Labor Relations Board has accused Wells Fargo of illegally threatening and retaliating against employees and coercing workers to prevent fair unionization votes at a California branch.\n\nMost employees of an Atwater, California, branch who signed cards supporting unionization in December 2023 voted against unionization the following month, a regional director of the NLRB alleged, in a complaint filed Tuesday and seen by Bloomberg,\n\nThe NLRB claims Wells Fargo coerced workers to vote against unionization. Wells Fargo has denied that allegation.\n\nThe labor board wants the bank to recognize and negotiate with the union despite the vote, based on a 2023 precedent case. The 2023 Cemex ruling strengthened the NLRB's power to compel companies that violate labor laws to recognize unions.\n\nHowever, Republicans and business groups oppose the precedent. The acting general counsel of NLRB, William Cowen, or his permanent replacement, could withdraw, amend, or settle the Wells Fargo complaint.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Cowen acting general counsel last week, days after firing NLRB\u2019s previous chief lawyer Jennifer Abruzzo, a Biden appointee, and Democratic board member Gwynne Wilcox.\n\nThe email notifying Wilcox of her termination said she was being fired since she did not \u201cshare the objectives\u201d of the present administration. Wilcox\u2019s ouster has left the board with only two members coupled with existing vacancies and does not meet the minimum number of members needed to adjudicate routine cases.\n\nWilcox is suing Trump, alleging the president surpassed his authority in firing her and requesting that she be allowed to resume her work as an NLRB member.\n\nThe NLRB complaint does not signify a complete investigation or a full adjudication of the allegations; rather, the regional office found that the allegations may be sufficient to go to a hearing to consider all evidence and make credibility determinations, a Wells Fargo spokesperson noted.\n\nEmployees at the Atwater branch voted 3-1 to reject unionization in January 2024. The branch manager allegedly told staff she knew about organizing discussions and warned about camera surveillance. She also reportedly told workers that Wells Fargo would apply stricter work conditions and would make union supporters stay longer hours.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson said the bank trains its managers to respect the rights of its employees to freely associate and join or support a union, or to bargain collectively with a representative of their choosing.\n\n\u201cWe train our managers to comply with labor law and respect the rights of our employees,\u201d the spokesperson told Banking Dive via email. \u201cIn this case, the majority of eligible employees freely voted against a union in a Board supervised secret ballot election and the facts do not support allegations to the contrary.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo is cooperating with the investigation but believes these allegations are unfounded and plans to defend the company and employees, the spokesperson added.\n\nAn NLRB hearing before a judge is scheduled for October, and Wells Fargo, if ordered to collectively bargain, can appeal to NLRB members in Washington, Bloomberg reported.\n\nRecently, unionized Wells Fargo employees hit a new challenge in organizing. The bank's conduct management intake team won its union vote 21-16 in December, making it the first non-branch unit at Wells Fargo to unionize.\n\nThe team, which handles customer and employee complaints across various locations, has now filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB through Wells Fargo Workers United-CWA. The complaint alleges that the bank illegally refuses to engage in collective bargaining following the certified union vote, American Banker reported. However, the bank contends it\u2019s waiting for the outcome of the NLRB\u2019s review and claims there were procedural flaws in the handling of the vote.\n\nCWA unionized 24 Wells Fargo branches last year, with around 200 employees being organized.\n\nWells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf pushed back on employee unionization efforts last April, saying it\u2019s important to \u201cmake clear that we continue to believe that our employees are best served by working directly with Wells Fargo and our leadership team.\u201d",

            "content": "The Brief Unauthorized withdrawals: A Houston-area couple discovered $40,000 had been fraudulently withdrawn from their business account through unauthorized direct pay transfers. Bank's response: Despite the couple's attempts to stop the transactions and the involvement of law enforcement, Wells Fargo denied the claim and refused to reimburse the funds. Frustration with bank: The couple expressed frustration with Wells Fargo's handling of the situation, highlighting the potential impact on individuals who rely heavily on their bank accounts.\n\n\n\nIn a letter, Wells Fargo Bank told Jose and Amanda Vasquez they've completed their investigation and, since they found no fraud, they're not returning the couple's money. But a Wells Fargo spokesperson tells FOX 26, they are still investigating.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nThe Vasquez's have a business account with Wells Fargo. They own Grindstone General Contracting.\n\n\"We mainly do renovations for apartment complexes,\" Jose said.\n\nWhen he checked his online account on January 27, Jose says he noticed someone had set up a direct pay transfer for $20,000.\n\n\"I said, 'hey, please stop the transaction. It's still pending. I don't recognize it. I don't authorize this transaction,'\" he said. \"They said, 'no, we're going to let it hit the other account, and we'll investigate.\"\n\nThe following morning, Jose says he sees another $20,000 gone from his account.\n\n\"The same thing happened last night, you guys got to stop it, another $20,000 in less than 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nThe couple initiated a criminal investigation.\n\nThey say a Fort Bend County Sheriff's Detective believes it's fraud, and has sent subpoenas to a bank in Alabama where the direct pay account is located, and to Wells Fargo. The Vasquez's say they sent affidavits to the bank detailing the fraud.\n\nThe couple says they don't understand why Wells Fargo let the second $20,000 leave their account when they had made the bank aware of the first one.\n\n\"Three days later, they sent us a letter saying the case was closed. They didn't think this was fraud,\" Jose said.\n\nWhile the sheriff's detective apparently considers it fraud, it's up to Wells Fargo to return the $40,000. The bank has told the Vasquez's that's not going to happen.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said Amanda. \"At the end of the day, the bank is there to protect customers and they've done absolutely nothing to do that. They wrote us a letter saying this is not fraud. Sorry.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, this came from a business account. It didn't affect our personal account,\" Amanda said. \"Had it been someone else, like our parents or someone old or retired who rely on this, what would they do? How would they pay their bills?\"\n\nGet news, weather and so much more on the new FOX LOCAL app",

            "content": "In December, Moody\u2019s upgraded its industry outlook from negative to stable for the first time since 2023, pointing to interest rate cuts and monetary policy adjustments by G-20 nations. The Federal Reserve implemented three rate cuts last year, bringing its target interest rate down to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Wall Street remains optimistic about the sector, with Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg predicting that major bank stocks will continue to rise, driven by expectations of a pro-growth, deregulation-focused agenda under the new administration. However, he acknowledged that corporate borrowing has remained subdued as businesses evaluate the post-election environment.\n\n\u201cThe 2025 stress test scenario, broadly better vs last year, increases our confidence that banks should begin to see the relief on regulatory capital requirements, given our expectations for a shift to a balanced, transparent, and more predictable regulatory regime.\u201d\n\nAnother factor influencing the bank's performance was the Federal Reserve's release of parameters for its annual industry stress test, which outlined milder hypothetical economic shocks compared to previous years. Although the test remains challenging\u2014projecting US unemployment rising to 10% and home prices dropping by 33%\u2014the 2025 scenario includes smaller increases in joblessness and less severe declines in stock and real estate values than in recent years. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg highlighted these adjustments in a report titled \u201c2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.\u201d Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala noted that with the latest version of the test being less stringent and more predictable, banks may not need to maintain as large of a capital buffer later this year. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\nBank stocks surged after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the 2024 presidential election. The rally was swift and broad-based, driven by market expectations of a more lenient regulatory environment starting in 2025, particularly regarding mergers and acquisitions. In November, the median total return for the 211 banks analyzed by S&P Global Market Intelligence reached 13.4%, significantly outperforming the broader market\u2019s 5.9% return.\n\nThe year 2024 was significant for major US banks. A recent Financial Times report highlighted that the country\u2019s seven largest banks accounted for 56% of the industry\u2019s profits in the first nine months of the year, up from 48% in the same period of 2023. The banking sector has also strengthened its capital position. In November, the Federal Reserve Board reported that 99% of US banks maintained capital levels above regulatory requirements. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) observed a 3.5% rise in equity capital during the third quarter of 2024, reinforcing the sector\u2019s improving capitalization.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against the other bank dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestor interest in bank stocks is growing, largely due to their attractive dividend payouts. A report from Janus Henderson revealed that banks were responsible for one-fifth of all dividends distributed in the third quarter, reflecting a 6.6% increase on an underlying basis\u2014outpacing the average across all sectors. Given their significant market presence, banks contributed the most to dividend growth in Q3, slightly surpassing the media sector. The latter saw a substantial 166% surge in payouts, driven by the resumption of dividend payments from major tech companies. The report further highlighted that bank stocks paid $38.2 billion in dividends during the third quarter of 2024. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks from the banking sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we picked the top 10 bank dividend stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds in the third quarter of 2024. We gauged hedge fund sentiment for these stocks using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds, as of Q3 2023.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

However, the company's net income grew to $5.07 billion, from $3.4 billion in the prior-year period. It reported robust growth in fee-based revenue, which rose 15% year over year, and helped counterbalance the anticipated decline in net interest income.

The company is also investing in technological advancements to maintain its competitive edge, especially against nonbank competitors that operate with fewer regulatory restrictions.

There aren\u2019t many other $0-annual-fee cards that offer those kinds of ongoing rewards with no rotating categories to manage.\n\nWells Fargo Autograph Journey\u2120 Card\n\nThe $95-annual-fee Wells Fargo Autograph Journey\u2120 Card offers high rewards for frequent travelers, including 5 points per $1 spent on hotel stays; 4 points per $1 on airfare; 3 points per $1 on other travel and dining; and 1 point per $1 on other qualifying purchases. New cardholders can also earn an outstanding sign-up bonus, and there's an annual $50 airfare statement credit (minimum purchase $50).\n\nWells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card\n\nThe $0-annual-fee Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 Card earns an unlimited 4% in cash rewards across a wide swath of spending categories, with a focus on self-care, wellness and the environment. Bonus categories include things like gym memberships; spas; EV charging; public transit; vintage stores; streaming; sports supplies; movie theaters; live shows and sporting events; amusement parks; pet supplies; and much more. All non-bonus-category spending earns 1% back. You can also earn a modest sign-up bonus.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Additional Wells Fargo cards that earn Wells Fargo Rewards but are no longer open for application include the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa\u00ae card, Wells Fargo Cash Back College Visa Card, Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card, Wells Fargo Rewards card and Wells Fargo Propel 365 American Express\u00ae Card.\n\nHow to redeem Wells Fargo Rewards\n\nWells Fargo Rewards can easily be redeemed in a variety of ways, either online, through the Wells Fargo app or by calling the 800 number on the back of your card. Redemption options include:\n\nCash back: If you have a Wells Fargo debit or ATM card, you can redeem points for cold hard cash by visiting a Wells Fargo ATM and cashing out your rewards in increments of $20 (or 2,000 points). You can also request a paper check in increments of $25 or 2,500 points, or redeem rewards as a deposit or credit to a qualifying Wells Fargo account (1 cent or 1-point minimum).\n\nStatement credit: You can redeem rewards against transactions made with your card of $1 or more, but you must have enough rewards to redeem for the entire transaction amount.\n\nTransfer Partners: Holding the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card or the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey\u2120 Card gives cardholders access to a limited list of hotel and airline transfer partners. This can provide outsized value for cardholders who don't mind putting in the work to learn how to use the individual partner loyalty programs.\n\nTravel: You can use the online portal to book travel with rewards, including flights, hotels, car rentals and more. There is no minimum revdemption amount and rewards are worth 1 cent each \u2014 unless you have the legacy Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card, which can offer increased value on plane tickets. (See the box below for more on that).\n\nPay with Rewards: You can use your rewards directly for merchandise when you shop online with a Wells Fargo partner merchant. You\u2019ll receive 1 cent per point in value but won\u2019t earn rewards on the transaction. You\u2019d be better off paying with your card to earn rewards and requesting cash back or a statement credit to cover the expense.\n\nGift cards: Rewards are worth 1 cent each when redeemed for gift cards. That\u2019s the same value as a cash redemption, although cash will be more flexible than gift cards.\n\nWells Fargo Rewards can be transferred or gifted to another Wells Fargo customer who also has a card that earns Wells Fargo Rewards.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Holders of the legacy Wells Fargo Visa Signature\u00ae Credit Card can get an increased 1.5- to 1.75-cent-per-point redemption value when using points to book airfare through the Wells Fargo Rewards online portal.\n\nShould you earn Wells Fargo Rewards?\n\nSimplicity and value are sometimes hard to find together, but with the Wells Fargo Rewards program, rewards are as easy to redeem as they are to earn. Cards that earn Wells Fargo Rewards offer low-cost, low-maintenance options that let you stack rewards fast.",

            "content": "A report issued Thursday by the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Financial Services entitled \u201cThe Real Wells Fargo: Board & Management Failures, Consumer Abuses, and Ineffective Regulatory Oversight\u201d found that due to \u201cserious deficiencies in its infrastructure for managing risks to consumers and complying with the law\u2026Wells Fargo\u2019s customers have been exposed to countless abuses, including racial discrimination, wrongful foreclosure, illegal vehicle repossession, and fraudulently opened accounts.\u201d\n\nWhile several agencies and institutions took public enforcement actions against Wells in 2016 and 2018\u2014including regulators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve\u2014the firm \u201chas yet to fully satisfy\u201d the orders, according to the report.\n\nThe report itself is the culmination of an investigation launched in February 2019 by Committee Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters, D.-Calif. It sought to determine and evaluate the non-public actions taken by Wells Fargo\u2019s board, management and regulators to make change at Wells Fargo and identify policy solutions to ensure consumers are protected from further abuses by megabanks like Wells.\n\nAmong the key findings of the report are that financial regulators knew about serious problems at Wells but failed to take public enforcement actions. In addition it was found that Wells\u2019 board failed to address the firm's problems and prioritized financial and other considerations above fixing the issues until forced to do so by regulators. The board also failed to hold senior management accountable for repeatedly failing to meet regulators\u2019 expectations. Finally, the report found that \u201cthe potential for widespread consumer abuse still remains\u201d at the bank.\n\nWells Fargo Advisors, the St. Louis-based wealth management unit of Wells Fargo, has been hemorrhaging advisors since the many issues at the bank first began coming to light in 2018. Q3 2019 advisor losses came to 211 advisors, or 2% of the force, and in Q4 the firm lost 456, or 3% year over year.\n\nThe megabank hired Charlie Scharf, a Visa veteran, as CEO in September of last year to turn around the bank\u2019s business. And Wells has gone out of its way to offer new services to advisors, such as the independent RIA unit it announced in 2019, which is serviced by First Clearing and TradePMR and counts about a dozen firms using its services to date.\n\nWells Fargo Advisors has also been aggressively recruiting. Company spokeswoman Kim Yurkovich told WealthManagement.com in January that the new advisors recruited to Wells Fargo during the year from other firms (meaning, advisors with some experience) were in fact up 27% over 2018, and the firm said those experienced hires were hitting production levels that were 57% higher than the average \u201cexperienced\u201d team at competing firms.\n\nYurkovich said this was evidence to indicate that despite smaller producers leaving, the firm was having success recruiting larger, more productive teams.\n\nWhile the jury is still out, Wells may not be in that big a hole, at least not due to its reputational issues, and one outside observer had a positive outlook about Wells Fargo Advisors\u2019 ability to bring in new blood.\n\n\u201cThe situation at Wells Fargo is unfortunate, but the company has done a great job in trying to course correct,\u201d said Greg O\u2019Gara, an analyst at Boston-based consulting firm Aite Group. \u201cAny time you have a question of reputation in the advisory world or a firmwise bump in the road, recruiters will come out of the woodwork and target those advisors\u2014it\u2019s an extremely competitive landscape,\u201d said O\u2019Gara.\n\n\u201cIn a way the issues at Wells may have been a perfect storm because the 10-year forgivable loans to former AG Edwards advisors would have expired, making them a target,\u201d he said.\n\n\"With all these variables at play, I think Wells has done a terrific job in continuing to build out its advisory model,\u201d O'Gara said.",

Several unauthorized withdrawals resulted in a loss of $11,000.\n\nA Sonoma resident was targeted in an ATM theft at Wells Fargo in Sonoma on Jan. 14, resulting in a loss of $11,000, police said.\n\nWhile using the ATM, the victim was approached by an individual who claimed to have found a $5 bill on the ground. Before the victim grabbed their card from the machine as they were completing the transaction, the suspect insisted they dropped the cash and then swapped the card with another while the victim was distracted.\n\nPolice said the suspect saw the victim enter their PIN and therefore gained access to their card . By the time the victim realized their card had been swapped, the suspect had made multiple unauthorized withdrawals totaling $11,000.\n\n\u201cThe person standing behind them identified a $5 bill on the ground and said, \u2018Oh, this is yours,\u2019 and handed it to the person. At the same time, they were grabbing the card and swapping it with another,\u201d Sonoma Police Chief Brandon Cutting said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a sleight of hand crime. The victim in this case denied it was their $5 and knew it wasn\u2019t, but the suspect was so insistent that they engaged.\u201d\n\nPolice said there were reports of similar incidents at Sonoma banks around the same time but no other linked to this case.\n\nThis particular incident targeted an elderly resident but Cutting emphasized it could happen to anyone.\n\nPolice advise ATM users to be aware of people behind them or around them and to ensure that no one can see them entering their PIN.\n\nWells Fargo bank was cooperative with police in attempting to identify the suspects. The investigation is ongoing and there are no suspects at this time.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Emma Molloy at emma.molloy@sonomanews.com.",

However, the Prime Visa requires an Amazon Prime membership which costs $14.99 a month or $139 a year (cheaper plans are available for young adults, students and qualified government assistance recipients). You may have, or want, a Prime membership to take advantage of the free shipping, Prime Video or other features. However, if you wouldn't otherwise pay for Prime, the membership fee can offset a big chunk of your credit card rewards. It would take $2,780 in purchases that earn 5% cash back (Amazon, Whole Foods, Chase Travel, etc.) to recoup a $139 Prime membership annual fee. Winner: Wells Fargo Attune\n\nWelcome bonus\n\nThe Prime Visa offers a $100 Amazon gift card instantly when you're approved for the card. The Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 World Elite Mastercard\u00ae provides a $100 cash rewards bonus after you spend $500 in purchases in the first three months. An Amazon gift card is a more restrictive bonus than cash rewards. However, you can buy almost anything on Amazon, and the Prime Visa card's welcome bonus is easier to earn because there's no spending requirement. Winner: Prime Visa\n\nRewards\n\nThe Prime Visa and Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 World Elite Mastercard\u00ae are cash-back credit cards. This makes the cards easier to compare because the rewards you earn have the same value and similar redemption options.\n\nPrime Visa and Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 World Elite Mastercard\u00ae rewards comparison Prime Visa Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Amazon.com 5% cash back Up to 4% cash rewards* Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh 5% cash back 1% cash rewards Chase Travel 5% cash back N/A Gas stations 2% cash back 1% cash rewards Restaurants 2% cash back 1% cash rewards Local transit and commuting 2% cash back 1% cash rewards (4% cash rewards for passenger railways, buses, public transit) Fitness and Wellness (spa, gym, etc.) 1% cash back 4% cash rewards Sports, recreation, entertainment 1% cash back 4% cash rewards EV charging and thrift stores 1% cash back 4% cash rewards All other purchases 1% cash back 1% cash rewards\n\n\n\n*While Amazon isn't specifically listed as a bonus category, reports suggest that Amazon.com purchases fall under the bookstore category, which earns 4%. The Wells Fargo Attune has a variety of bonus spending categories that are rare to find with other rewards credit cards. Purchases at antique shops, garden supply stores, florists, game and hobby stores, barber shops, massage parlors and more all earn 4% cash rewards. That's a healthy return compared to most cards which earn 1% to 2% in rewards for those purchases. Plus, you'll get 4% cash rewards at bookstores, including Amazon.com and Amazon Marketplace (based on the CNBC Select team's experiences and online reports). The Prime Visa offers a top-tier 5% return on Amazon purchases, including Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. So it's a more rewarding card for Amazon spending, especially if you already pay for a Prime membership. It's also a better card for restaurant and gas station purchases. Winner: Wells Fargo Attune. This is a close call, but the Prime Visa is only slightly more valuable in a few categories.\n\nRedemption options\n\nThe Prime Visa and Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 World Elite Mastercard\u00ae offer similar redemption options. The cashback you earn with the Prime Visa is earned as points and each point is worth one cent. You can redeem Prime Visa rewards for eligible Amazon purchases or cash back, gift cards or travel through Chase.com. The cash rewards you earn with the Wells Fargo Attune can be redeemed for statement credits toward previous purchases, gift cards, a deposit into an eligible Wells Fargo account, at checkout when you pay with PayPal, merchandise and travel. If you have a Wells Fargo card that enables transfers to travel partners, such as the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card or Wells Fargo Autograph Journey\u2120 Card, you can combine the rewards you earn with the Attune card. This lets you indirectly earn transferable travel rewards with a Wells Fargo Attune card. Winner: Wells Fargo Attune, because pairing it with specific Wells Fargo credit cards increases the value of the rewards.\n\nBenefits\n\nEligible Prime Visa cardholders earn 10% cash back (or more) on select Amazon.com purchases. You can also utilize the following insurance perks: Purchase protection\n\nExtended warranty\n\nTravel accident insurance\n\nLost luggage reimbursement\n\nBaggage delay insurance\n\nRental car insurance\n\nNo foreign transaction fees The Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 World Elite Mastercard\u00ae has a smaller list of protections, including: Cell phone protection\n\nMastercard concierge services\n\nMastercard ID theft protection\n\nRental car insurance Winner: Prime Visa Compare savings accounts\n\nWhich should you get?\n\nPrime Visa and Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 World Elite Mastercard\u00ae overview Prime Visa Wells Fargo Attune\u2120 World Elite Mastercard\u00ae Credit score requirement Good to excellent Good to excellent Welcome offer Yes Yes Annual fee $0 (Prime membership required) $0 Rewards 5% back at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market and on Chase Travel purchases with an eligible Prime membership; 2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and on local transit and commuting (including rideshare); 1% back on all other purchases. 4% cash rewards on fitness and wellness, on select sports, recreation, and entertainment (including live shows and sporting events), on gardening and floral stores, as well as pet supplies, boarding and grooming and on public transit, EV charging stations, and select thrift stores. Earn 1% cash rewards on other purchases. Intro APR None Yes, for purchases Standout benefits Travel and purchase protections, no foreign transaction fees Travel and purchase protections\n\n\n\nFAQs Is the Amazon Prime Store Card worth it? Similar to the Prime Visa, the Amazon Prime Store Card is available only to Prime members and offers a high rate of return at Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market (with in-store code). However, you can't use it for purchases outside of Amazon. So it's less useful than the Prime Visa, which can be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted. What cards get you 5% back at Amazon? The Prime Visa and Amazon Prime Store Card both earn 5% back at Amazon and Whole Foods. The Affinity Cash Rewards Visa\u00ae Signature credit card also earns 5% cash back at Amazon on up to $1,000 in Amazon purchases per month. What credit score do you need for the Wells Fargo Attune card? The Wells Fargo Attune card typically requires a good to excellent credit score, which is a FICO Score of 670 or higher.\n\nSubscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Wells Fargo & Co's (NYSE:WFC) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-02-11, Wells Fargo & Co's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $62.09. It's currently trading at a price of $79.1. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -27.4%. The company is fair valued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Wells Fargo & Co's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $5.38 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.52%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = -2.40% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 28.36 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 10.57 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 62.09\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $107.06. This valuation indicates that the Wells Fargo & Co is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 26.12%.

This initiative aims to boost tourism while educating visitors about the production processes. By integrating local culture and industrial transparency, the policy seeks to attract more visitors and enhance revenue generation through tourism.\n\nModernization of Liquor Outlets\n\nRetail outlets will undergo modernization to improve customer experience. This includes better infrastructure, improved inventory management, and training for retail staff.

            "content": "The Brief In a FOX 26 Follow Up, we've learned a woman, who was swindled out of her life savings, was able to get her money back from Wells Fargo. FOX 26 initially spoke with Heather, who said she received a call from an actual Wells Fargo Bank number, and that they had the information of her previous transactions. However, it wasn't really Wells Fargo Bank. Wells Fargo Bank provided additional information on ways you can protect yourself from becoming a victim.\n\n\n\nBefore FOX 26 got involved, Wells Fargo Bank told Heather Sanders they understood she unknowingly participated in a fraud scheme, but refused to assume liability. Now the bank is returning her money.\n\n\"I feel very blessed. It's a huge weight off my shoulders,\" said Heather. \"It's money I've been saving, so I was very happy.\"\n\nWells Fargo has refunded more than $4,000 to Heather.\n\nThe backstory:\n\nIn an only on FOX report, we told you how she got a call from an actual Wells Fargo bank phone number.\n\n\"They were in my account when I was speaking with them,\" Heather said. \"They were going through transactions I had already used. They had all the information, that's another reason I believed them.\"\n\nShe says the thief or thieves sent texts that looked real. Two couriers showed up to take her card, which she was instructed to cut in half. The faces of both were caught on camera.\n\nSheriff's Deputies are investigating.\n\nGet news, weather and so much more on the new FOX LOCAL app\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nHeather believes it was our report that caused Wells Fargo to change its mind and return all her money.\n\n\"After it aired Friday, they reached out by Monday, opened it, and escalated it to their highest department. I had an answer within three days, they said it could take up to 10,\" she said. \"I don't believe if you wouldn't have run the story, they would have stuck with their decision, no matter what evidence I sent.\"\n\nIn a statement, Wells Fargo told FOX 26, \"Upon reviewing additional information, we are happy we could resolve this matter working directly with our customer. Wells Fargo will never ask you to give us your physical card and PIN number to prevent fraud or scams. If anyone asks you to do that, it's a scam.\"\n\nTips for viewers from Wells Fargo Bank:\n\nScammers will try to rush you into taking action, so you won\u2019t take time to stop, think, and verify facts.\n\nScammers can spoof their caller ID number.\n\nCommon tactics include asking you to provide sensitive personal information or to send money to help stop a phony transaction or receive a refund.\n\nYour bank won\u2019t ask you to send a payment or your physical card to prevent or stop fraud in your account. If you get a call asking for that, immediately hang up and call your bank directly.\n\nProviding personal information such as One-Time passcodes, passwords, or PIN can give scammers access to your account and your funds.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable with a request received by phone call or text that you didn\u2019t initiate, don\u2019t respond and hang up immediately. Contact the company using legitimate sources.\n\nWe encourage people to visit Wells Fargo\u2019s online security center to learn about common scams and how to avoid them.\n\nAdditional Information from Wells Fargo Bank:\n\nOur work to prevent scams is a priority and we\u2019re increasing our education efforts through alerts in online banking sessions, mobile app, various customer communications, displaying warning notifications, through our Online Security Center , and resources like our Security Brochure .

            "content": "Wyndham Clark is the Wells Fargo defending champion\n\nThe 20th edition of the Wells Fargo Championship takes place at Quail Hollow Club in North Carolina for the final PGA Tour event before next week\u2019s PGA Championship.\n\nThe Wells Fargo maintains its elevated status in 2024 as one of the eight signature events on the PGA Tour, bringing with it an increased prize purse along with smaller no-cut fields.\n\nFollowing 12 years as an official sponsor of the event going back to 2011, Wells Fargo announced in January that they won\u2019t be renewing after the 2024 tournament. With the PGA Tour already losing Farmers Insurance as a sponsor combined with the RBC Heritage and RBC Canadian Open only committing to one-year deals in 2024, the short-term future of the tour isn\u2019t looking promising.\n\nWyndham Clark secured his first PGA Tour victory last year in the event, finishing at 19-under, four shots clear of Xander Schauffele. His 265 total is the lowest score in the history of the tournament, which clearly gave him the confidence boost needed to hold off Rory McIlroy a few weeks later to claim his maiden major championship at the U.S. Open.\n\nWith Valhalla calling, this week gives those competing in Kentucky the perfect chance to sharpen up their game ahead of the second major of the year, where Brooks Koepka who ominiously returned to form at LIV Singapore, goes in search of a fourth PGA Championship.\n\nSouth of the North Carolina border this week, the PGA Tour\u2019s inaugural Myrtle Beach Classic runs concurrently, while over on the LPGA Tour, the world\u2019s best women compete for the Cognizant Founders Cup.\n\nWho is playing at the Wells Fargo Championship?\n\nLike all signature events on tour, the smaller field means the Wells Fargo Championship field is stacked full of quality. A total of 15 major champions will be teeing it up in Charlotte this week, including McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, and Clark, who will be looking to win the title for the second consecutive year.\n\nWill Zalatoris returns after missing the recent CJ Cup Byron Nelson due to a flare-up with his back as he plays the event for the first time since 2021, where he missed the cut.\n\nOne notable absence is that of Scottie Scheffler. The undisputed best player on the planet has won four of his previous five events, including his second Masters title last month. Where did he finish in the tournament he didn\u2019t win? Second.\n\nThe full field competing at Quail Hollow can be found here.\n\nWhat is the format of the Wells Fargo Championship?\n\nDue to its elevated status as one of the eight signature events combined with a smaller field, there won\u2019t be a cut at the tournament. All players competing will play 72 holes of strokeplay, 18 more than their counterparts on the LIV breakaway tour.\n\nWhere is the Wells Fargo Championship being played?\n\nQuail Hollow will host the tournament for the 19th time. The par-71, 7,521-yard course was designed by architect George Cobb, but it has been altered several times since by Arnold Palmer and Tom Fazio.\n\nAside from hosting the Wells Fargo Championship, the course used to host the Kemper Open between 1969 and 1979, while the PGA Championship (2017) and Presidents Cup (2022) have both been contested at Quail Hollow.\n\nOriginally a scoreable par-72, Fazio\u2019s redesign in 2016 ahead of the 2017 PGA saw the course change to its current format as a par-71.\n\nHoles 16-18 have been dubbed the \u2018Green Mile\u2019 due to their notorious difficulty. The 16th is a 506-yard par 4, the 17th is a 223-yard par 3 where water comes into play, while the final hole is a 494-yard par 4 which features a creek down the entire left side. These three holes could provide plenty of entertainment on Sunday, especially if there are several players within a couple of shots of the leader.\n\nWho will win the Wells Fargo Championship?\n\nMcIlroy comes into the event having won his 25th PGA Tour title at the recent Zurich Classic of New Orleans alongside Shane Lowry. The Northern Irishman has plenty of pedigree at Quail Hollow. Not only has he won the tournament three times (2010, 2015, and 2021), but the 35-year-old also holds the course record of 61, which he recorded in 2015.\n\nA two-time winner of the tournament, Max Homa, is another one to watch out for. The American came close to winning his first major title at the Masters, finishing in a tie for third at Augusta. Sweden\u2019s Ludvig Aberg is a late withdrawal with a minor knee issue.\n\nHow much will the winner of the Wells Fargo Championship receive?\n\nThe Wells Fargo Championship has a $20m prize fund due to its elevated status. The winner will receive a cheque for $3.6m while the runner-up will take home $2.18m.\n\nRead up on how the PGA Tour purses have evolved in recent years and which players feature in the all-time top earners on the PGA Tour.\n\nHow to watch the Wells Fargo Championship\n\nViewers in the US can watch the action on the Golf Channel.\n\nAll ET times\n\nThursday, May 9: The Golf Channel, 14.00\n\nFriday, May 10: The Golf Channel, 14.00\n\nSaturday, May 11: The Golf Channel, 13.00\n\nSunday, May 12: The Golf Channel, 13.00\n\nUK viewers can watch the event on Sky Sports Golf.\n\nThursday 9 May: Sky Sports Golf, 12.30 | 19.00\n\nFriday 10 May: Sky Sports Golf, 12.30 | 19.00\n\nSaturday 11 May: Sky Sports Golf, 12.15 | 18.00\n\nSunday 12 May: Sky Sports Golf, 12.15 | 18.00\n\nThe Wells Fargo Championship: Tee times\n\nTee times and groupings for rounds 3 & 4 can be found here.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO TODAY\u2019S GOLFER: Print and Digital access, discounts and rewards!",

            "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Wells Fargo (WFC).\n\nWells Fargo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.7% and 3.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for WFC\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Wells Fargo here>>>\n\n\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Wells Fargo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs WFC Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Wells Fargo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.8% over the past month to $5.89.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Wells Fargo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Wells Fargo may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025.

Redemptions, such as gift cards and cash rewards, offer a value of 1 cent per point.\n\nThe only way to exceed this rate \u2014 potentially getting 2, 3, or even 4+ cents of value \u2014 is to transfer your points to Wells Fargo\u2019s airline and hotel transfer partners. Redeeming points this way will allow you to receive maximum value from your rewards for travel. That could include multiple-night stays at European hotels or a business class flight across the country.\n\nAlthough you\u2019ll get the most value for your points this way, award availability is never guaranteed and will always depend on the travel date and demand, among other factors. While it can take a lot of extra work to find a flight or hotel that\u2019s bookable with points, it can be well worth it once you save hundreds of dollars on travel.\n\nThere are tons of examples of how to redeem points for travel, so we\u2019ll go over the 22 best ways you can achieve this goal.\n\nEarn Wells Fargo Rewards Points\n\nTo earn Wells Fargo Rewards points, you\u2019ll need the right credit card in your wallet.

To join one of these programs, sign up for a free loyalty account with the airline and then transfer your Wells Fargo Rewards points, with a minimum of 1 point.\n\nThe ratios are easy to understand: transfer 1 Wells Fargo Rewards point to get 1 airline mile.\n\nWells Fargo Hotel Transfer Partners\n\nThanks to Wells Fargo\u2019s partnership with Choice Privileges, you can take advantage of a generous 1:2 transfer ratio. By transferring 1 Wells Fargo Rewards point, you\u2019ll get 2 Choice Privileges points, making this an excellent way to redeem points for hotel nights.\n\nHot Tip: We recommend using our transfer partner calculator tool, which takes active transfer bonuses into consideration, to know exactly how many points you\u2019ll get from transferring credit card rewards to an airline or hotel loyalty program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 19 Best Ways To Redeem Your Wells Fargo Rewards Points for Flights\n\nWe highly recommend redeeming your Wells Fargo Rewards points to book flights with one of the program\u2019s 5 airline transfer partners. Though they are all international carriers, these airlines are part of the 3 major alliances: Oneworld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll show you how to maximize your points for domestic and international flights.\n\n1. Book Qatar Airways QSuite to Doha (British Airways Avios)\n\nThe fantastic QSuite product will eventually replace all of the older business class seats. Image Credit: Alex Miller\n\nQatar Airways adopted Avios as its mileage currency in 2022, which is shared between Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, and Vueling. You can book Qatar Airways flights by redeeming Avios via British Airways Executive Club or Iberia Plus. The latter 2 programs are transfer partners of Wells Fargo Rewards.\n\nHow much will this cost you, exactly? For 94,500 points transferred to British Airways and roughly $100 in taxes and fees, you can book a one-way ticket in Qatar Airways QSuite. Award availability can be hard to come by, but it\u2019s a steal if you come across it.\n\nOne of the best ways to book Qatar Airways QSuites. Image Credit: British Airways\n\nThe airline flies to its Doha (DOH) hub from a few major U.S. cities. Look for the aircraft with QSuite, as Qatar hasn\u2019t fully rolled out this product fleetwide. You can often find it from Atlanta (ATL), Los Angeles (LAX), Miami (MIA), and New York (JFK) to Doha (DOH).\n\nHot Tip: Read our definitive guide on Qatar\u2019s nonstop routes from the U.S., including plane types and seat options.\n\n2. Fly to Hawaii From the West Coast U.S. (British Airways Avios)\n\nIf a getaway to Hawaii is up your alley, take advantage of the favorable award rates by British Airways Avios. The carrier is a part of the Oneworld alliance, which means you can book domestic flights with its partners American Airlines and Alaska Airlines.\n\nAward availability is easy to find on routes from the West Coast to Hawaii, with multiple seats per flight. As a domestic flight, it will cost you 20,000 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees per person.\n\nThere are 4 seats left on this route from Los Angeles (LAX) to Honolulu (HNL). Image Credit: British Airways\n\nHere\u2019s an example of routes you can book:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) \u2013 Kona (KOA)\n\nSan Diego (SAN) \u2013 Honolulu (HNL)\n\nSan Francisco (SFO) \u2013 Maui (OGG)\n\n3. Take Short-Haul Flights on Partner Airlines (British Airways Avios)\n\nDomestic flights can be surprisingly expensive, sometimes costing you an arm and a leg. That\u2019s why you can save lots of cash by booking short-haul flights with British Airways Avios on its partners American and Alaska.\n\nAlthough British Airways has devalued redemptions several times recently, there are still some mileage deals to be found. Here\u2019s a look at the award pricing you can expect based on the flight distance:\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Flight Distance Award Pricing via British Airways Avios Less than 650 miles 12,000 Avios in economy 24,000 Avios in business 651 to 1,150 miles 16,000 Avios in economy 32,000 Avios in business 1,151 to 2,000 miles 18,000 Avios in economy 40,000 Avios in business 2,001 to 3,000 miles 20,000 Avios in economy 50,000 Avios in business\n\nHere are some examples of routes that you can book and their award rates:\n\nNew York (JFK) \u2013 Los Angeles (LAX): 20,000 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees\n\n20,000 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees Raleigh-Durham (RDU) \u2013 Phoenix (PHX): 18,000 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees\n\n18,000 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees Tampa (TPA) \u2013 Dallas (DFW): 16,000 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees\n\n16,000 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees Washington, D.C. (DCA) \u2013 Boston (BOS): 12,000 Avios and $5.60 in taxes and fees\n\nHot Tip: Upgraded Points\u2019 Senior Editor and Content Contributor Juan Ruiz always redeems British Airways Avios for flights to the Caribbean because of the favorable award pricing from nearby Miami International Airport (MIA).\n\n4. Fly From the West Coast to Tokyo (British Airways Avios)\n\nWe love using British Airways Avios because of their flexibility. In addition to quick trips within the U.S., you can also redeem them for long flights from the West Coast to Tokyo\u2019s Haneda or Narita Airports.\n\nA one-way ticket in economy will set you back 25,750 Avios, 77,250 Avios for business class, or 103,000 Avios for first class on partner Japan Airlines. The taxes and fees will run you a few hundred dollars.\n\nPartner award availability can be hard to come by, but check out this great redemption above. Image Credit: British Airways\n\nHere\u2019s a short list of routes you can book with British Airways Avios to Japan for these rates:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) \u2013 Tokyo (NRT) and Tokyo (HND) on Japan Airlines\n\nand on Japan Airlines San Francisco (SFO) \u2013 Tokyo (NRT) and Tokyo (HND) on Japan Airlines\n\n5. Fly to Amsterdam, Paris, and Beyond in Business Class (Flying Blue)\n\nGetting to Europe in a lie-flat seat can help ease the effects of jetlag from a long-haul flight. Wells Fargo Rewards points transfer to Flying Blue, the joint frequent flyer program of Air France and KLM. These international airlines are headquartered in Paris and Amsterdam, respectively, but they fly to virtually every European city from their hubs.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, you can book SkyTeam alliance partners Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic via Flying Blue, giving you significantly more options to get to Europe in business class.\n\nWhile award pricing is variable, meaning it will highly depend on the route and travel demand, you can expect one-way tickets in business class to start at 50,000 Flying Blue miles. Taxes and fees will run you about $250, but this is a bargain compared to the thousands of dollars you\u2019d normally pay for the same ticket. Check out the starting rates on a nonstop flight from Boston (BOS) to Paris (CDG):\n\nFlying Blue has some of the most affordable redemption rates. Image Credit: Air France\n\nWant to fly elsewhere in Europe? You\u2019ll get the same economy pricing on a flight from Boston (BOS) to Rome (FCO) via Paris (CDG):\n\nTack on another European city for the same economy rate. Image Credit: Air France\n\nHot Tip: Credit card issuers will often run limited-time transfer bonuses, so you can move over fewer points to a loyalty program and book the same ticket for less!\n\n6. Snag Cheap Economy and Premium Economy Flights to Europe (Flying Blue)\n\nIf you need to book multiple seats in business class, it will be significantly harder to find the standard 50,000-mile pricing as shown in the previous example. That\u2019s why booking economy and premium economy is a great alternative, as you\u2019ll consistently find more award space to book your entire group on 1 itinerary.\n\nPremium economy is the happy medium for many travelers. Image Credit: Katie Seemann\n\nSummer is peak travel season in Europe, and you certainly can\u2019t beat Flying Blue\u2019s award rates in a pinch. You can book an entire round-trip fare for 40,000 Flying Blue miles in economy or 70,000 Flying Blue miles in premium economy if you prefer more comfort.\n\nHot Tip: A winning strategy to save miles and fly comfortably: book business class on the overnight flight to Europe, then book premium economy or economy for the daytime flight back home.\n\n7. Save up to 50% on Flights With Flying Blue Promo Rewards (Flying Blue)\n\nMovie and dinner in the sky. Image Credit: Christy Rodriguez\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Flying Blue\u2019s Promo Rewards program updates mileage deals every month with 25% or 50% off economy and business class redemptions originating from Europe. This can be a great option to book flights between Europe and North America, within Europe, or elsewhere in the world.\n\nFor instance, when Promo Rewards offers 50% off on routes between Europe and North America, you will only pay 12,500 miles in economy and 26,500 miles in business class. While Promo Rewards do not discount the taxes and fees associated with a ticket, it\u2019s still an underrated way to book discounted award flights.\n\n8. Fly to Asia in Business Class From the Continental U.S. (Flying Blue)\n\nAward seats to Asia are incredibly rare to come by. Flying Blue partners with several Asian airlines you can redeem miles with, including Japan Airlines and Korean Air. Here are a few options for travelers looking to book flights from San Francisco (SFO) to Seoul (ICN), which are pretty reasonable compared to cash rates.\n\nFlying Blue offers a lot of partnerships with carriers. Image Credit: Air France\n\n9. Fly to Hawaii on Delta in Economy From the Continental U.S. (Flying Blue)\n\nYou can book Delta Air Lines award travel with Wells Fargo Rewards points through Flying Blue. An excellent redemption using Flying Blue miles is for a flight from the continental U.S. to Hawaii. A round-trip ticket in economy will only cost roughly 35,000 Flying Blue miles and about $11.20 in fees.\n\nBook Delta flights with Flying Blue. Image Credit: Air France\n\nFlying Blue also partners with other big rewards programs: Amex Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Bilt Rewards, Capital One Miles, Citi ThankYou Rewards, and Marriott Bonvoy. There\u2019s no shortage of ways to earn Flying Blue miles.\n\n10. Fly to Mexico on Delta or Aeromexico in Economy From the U.S. (Flying Blue)\n\nFlights between the U.S. and Mexico are a bargain with Flying Blue. You can book flights on Delta and Aeromexico with Flying Blue miles on various routes starting at just 16,000 miles in each direction.\n\nBook Aeromexico with Flying Blue. Image Credit: Air France\n\nHere are a few examples of routes you can book:\n\nDetroit (DTW) \u2013 Cancun (CUN) on Delta\n\nMinneapolis (MSP) \u2013 Puerto Vallarta (PVR) on Delta\n\nRaleigh-Durham (RDU) \u2013 Mexico City (MEX) on Aeromexico\n\n11. Take Cheap Economy Flights to Tahiti From the U.S. (Flying Blue)\n\nAir France operates a unique nonstop route between Los Angeles (LAX) and Tahiti (PPT), so you can redeem Flying Blue miles to get away as far as French Polynesia. A one-way economy flight will cost you around 27,500 miles and $100 in taxes and fees.\n\nIf Tahiti is on your bucket list, book this flight with Flying Blue miles. Image Credit: Air France\n\nPremium economy is also quite affordable at 40,000 miles if that\u2019s more of your style. For the 8-hour flight, it might be worth the splurge.\n\n12. Book Cheap Economy Class Flights to Dublin From Several U.S. Cities (Aer Lingus AerClub)\n\nAnother Wells Fargo Rewards transfer partner is Aer Lingus AerClub. This airline program earns Avios, and you can transfer Avios between British Airways Executive Club, Iberia Plus, and Qatar Airways Privilege Club.\n\nAlthough they share the same currency, each frequent flyer program has its own award pricing and sweet spots. Most famously, Aer Lingus charges 26,000 Avios (off-peak) or 40,000 Avios (peak) to book a round-trip ticket between the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nAffordable flights to Ireland thanks to Avios. Image Credit: Aer Lingus\n\nThat\u2019s a great deal, and here are a few routes you can find this mileage rate from cities in the Northeast:\n\nBoston (BOS) \u2013 Shannon (SNN) and Dublin (DUB)\n\nNew York (JFK) \u2013 Shannon (SNN) and Dublin (DUB)\n\nPhiladelphia (PHL) \u2013 Dublin (DUB)\n\nAer Lingus also flies nonstop to Ireland from other U.S. cities beyond the Northeast, including Los Angeles (LAX) and Miami (MIA). Because these airports are a bit further away, round-trip flights in economy will cost 32,500 Avios (off-peak) or 50,000 Avios (peak). You can book all Aer Lingus Avios awards here.\n\n13. Fly to Spain From the U.S. in Business Class (Iberia Plus)\n\nAll aboard Iberia to Spain. Image Credit: Daniel Ross\n\nLooking to book a one-way business class ticket between the U.S. and Spain? How does 34,000 Avios sound? Iberia Plus offers one of the most affordable ways to get to Spain (or Europe, for that matter) with points and miles.\n\nWhile Iberia\u2019s product is nothing worth writing home about, we can\u2019t complain about a comfortable lie-flat seat across the Atlantic. The airline charges 34,000 Avios (off-peak) and 50,000 Avios (peak) for certain routes to Spain:\n\nBoston (BOS) \u2013 Madrid (MAD)\n\nChicago (ORD) \u2013 Madrid (MAD)\n\nNew York (JFK) \u2013 Barcelona (BCN) and Madrid (MAD)\n\n14. Fly to Spain From the U.S. in Economy or Premium Economy (Iberia Plus)\n\nIberia\u2019s economy and premium economy rates are incredibly reasonable. These can be a great alternative to business class, as there will usually never be more than 1 to 2 award seats available at a time.\n\nI loved flying premium economy on Iberia. Image Credit: Iberia\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to book a flight for a family, you can often book up to 9 award seats in economy and premium economy instead \u2014 and save quite a bit on Avios.\n\n15. Fly Lufthansa First Class Without Surcharges to Europe (Avianca LifeMiles)\n\nIndulge in luxury with Lufthansa first class. Image Credit: Cherag Dubash\n\nAvianca is part of the Star Alliance, unlocking epic redemptions on highly sought-after carriers. Travelers can use Avianca LifeMiles to book flights on Lufthansa, particularly for its first class product on the Boeing 747-8i, which is an example of a great redemption.\n\nImage Credit: LifeMiles\n\nIt can be incredibly difficult to find the award space for Lufthansa\u2019s first class, as the carrier mostly puts last-minute redemptions up for grabs. If your plans are flexible \u2014 we\u2019re talking 3 days or less \u2014 you may be able to score this coveted redemption for just 87,000 LifeMiles. These routes include Chicago (ORD), New York (JFK), and Washington, D.C. (IAD) to Frankfurt (FRA).\n\n16. Fly to Australia and New Zealand (Avianca LifeMiles)\n\nTake a flight down under with points and miles. Image Credit: Avianca\n\nFlying to Australia or New Zealand can often cost well over $1,500 for a round-trip ticket. Booking your tickets with LifeMiles can be a great way to save money instead. A one-way economy ticket costs 40,000 LifeMiles, while a business class ticket costs 80,000 miles, although the award space for the latter option will be significantly more difficult to find.\n\nHere are some example flights you could book:\n\nChicago (ORD) \u2013 Auckland (AKL) on Air New Zealand\n\non Air New Zealand Houston (IAH) \u2013 Auckland (AKL) on Air New Zealand\n\non Air New Zealand Los Angeles (LAX) \u2013 Melbourne (MEL) on United Airlines\n\non United Airlines San Francisco (SFO) \u2013 Auckland (AKL) on United Airlines\n\non United Airlines Vancouver (YVR) \u2013 Sydney (SYD) on Air Canada\n\n17. Fly to Asia in Business Class (Avianca LifeMiles)\n\nAvianca LifeMiles offers excellent redemption opportunities to Asia. You can book a one-way ticket for 85,000 LifeMiles and under $30 in taxes and fees! It can be worth the time to search for business class seats with partners such as United Airlines and Asiana Airlines.\n\nBook United or Asiana flights with miles. Image Credit: Avianca\n\nTo get even cheaper business class tickets, consider positioning yourself in Hawaii. You could book an ANA flight from Honolulu (HNL) to Tokyo (HND) for just 48,000 LifeMiles and $27.80 in taxes and fees.\n\nYou can use LifeMiles to book several nonstop routes to Asia:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) \u2013 Seoul (ICN) on Asiana Airlines\n\non Asiana Airlines New York (JFK) \u2013 Tokyo (NRT) on ANA\n\non ANA San Francisco (SFO) \u2013 Seoul (ICN) on United Airlines\n\nHot Tip: Booking last-minute flights allows you to score some of the most amazing mileage redemptions out there. LifeMiles tends to open up lots of partner award space on many of the routes illustrated above.\n\n18. Fly From New York to Portugal in Business Class for a Record Low Rate (Avianca LifeMiles)\n\nTAP Air Portugal flies the A321neo aircraft. Image Credit: Ryan Smith\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of ways to book business class seats to virtually every corner of the world \u2014 due in part to Avianca LifeMiles availability.\n\nImage Credit: Avianca\n\nAnother great partner to consider is TAP Air Portugal, where flights to (or from) Portugal will cost 63,000 miles in business class:\n\nChicago (ORD) \u2013 Lisbon (LIS)\n\nMiami (MIA) \u2013 Lisbon (LIS)\n\nNewark (EWR) \u2013 Porto (OPO)\n\nSan Francisco (SFO) \u2013 Lisbon (LIS)\n\nHowever, Avianca has a quirk with its award pricing on the nonstop route between New York (JFK) and Lisbon (LIS). This business class flight can be booked for just 35,000 miles instead, so it\u2019s worth booking a positioning flight to JFK even if you\u2019re not based in the New York area.\n\nRun, don\u2019t walk to book this award. Image Credit: Avianca\n\n19. Fly to T\u00fcrkiye in Business Class on Turkish Airlines (Avianca LifeMiles)\n\nIf T\u00fcrkiye is on your bucket list, transfer 63,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points to Avianca LifeMiles to book a one-way business class ticket on Turkish Airlines. Some aircraft are updated with newer business class seats than others, but these seats will generally provide plenty of legroom and elevated dining onboard.\n\nTurkish business class on the Boeing 777. Image Credit: Chris Dong\n\nIn general, we love booking with LifeMiles to be freed from out-of-pocket fuel surcharges that often plague international award flights on other loyalty programs. Turkish Airlines operates several nonstop routes that you can book from Chicago (ORD), Los Angeles (LAX), and New York (JFK) to Istanbul (IST).\n\nThe 3 Best Ways To Redeem Your Wells Fargo Rewards Points for Hotels\n\nAlthough Wells Fargo Rewards only offers 1 hotel partner \u2014 Choice Privileges \u2014 cardholders can transfer points to the program at a 1:2 ratio. Essentially, you\u2019ll get double the rewards by transferring Wells Fargo Rewards points to Choice Privileges.\n\nThe loyalty program offers upscale stays with its Ascend Collection properties and brands like Radisson Blu. However, Choice is also a partner with Preferred Hotels, which is a collection of hundreds of independently owned luxury hotels and resorts around the world. Guest rooms start at 25,000 points per night, so you\u2019ll only need half that amount when transferring points from Wells Fargo.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve transferred points to your Choice Privileges account, visit the Choice Hotels website and toggle Use Choice Privileges points instead under the Special Rates section. However, to book Preferred Hotels properties, you\u2019ll need to visit this dedicated link upon logging into your loyalty account.\n\n1. Book Preferred Hotels Properties in the U.S. (Choice Privileges)\n\nOne of the most luxurious hotels in the Gaslamp Quarter, bookable with Choice points! Image Credit: Pendry San Diego\n\nWe highly recommend booking Preferred Hotel properties to maximize your Wells Fargo Rewards points. Here\u2019s a shortlist of the properties you can book within the U.S.:\n\nDon\u2019t forget to halve the rates quoted above when transferring Wells Fargo Rewards points to Choice Privileges, which makes the deal even sweeter.\n\n2. Book Preferred Hotels Properties Abroad (Choice Privileges)\n\nAntigua is one of my favorite international destinations of all time. Image Credit: Porta Hotel Antigua\n\nThe Preferred Hotels collection offers a ton of properties outside of the U.S., too, so don\u2019t overlook these options when you\u2019re planning your next vacation. Whether you\u2019re interested in visiting Italy or Japan, these are our favorite properties you can book with Choice points:\n\n3. Book Affordable Hotels Starting at 8,000 Points Per Night (Choice Privileges)\n\nThere are nearly 2 dozen brands that fall under the Choice Hotels portfolio, most of which are budget hotels such as Comfort Inn and Sleep Inn. With award nights starting at just 8,000 Choice Privileges points (4,000 Wells Fargo points!), this could be one of the most affordable ways to book hotels with points.\n\nBudget-friendly properties you can book in the Phoenix metro area.

How Much Are Wells Fargo Rewards Points Worth?\n\nEvery month, we publish our updated list of points and miles valuations across dozens of programs. At this time, we value Wells Fargo Rewards points at approximately 1.5 cents each.\n\nKeep in mind that this valuation is subjective, and how much value you get from points depends on how you use them. For instance, redeeming points for gift cards or cash rewards will only get you a set value of 1 cent each. Leveraging transfer partners can get you much more value, but knowing our benchmark can help you gauge whether you achieved good value from your rewards.\n\nGetting 3 to 6 cents per point is possible with Wells Fargo Rewards. To play on the safe side, we\u2019ll assume that you can redeem your points for roughly 1.5 cents each when leveraging transfer partners.\n\n5. How Much Are Wells Fargo Autograph Journey Card Points Worth?\n\nThe Wells Fargo Autograph Journey card earns Wells Fargo Rewards points, which are worth 1.5 cents in our view. However, the value can greatly depend on how you redeem them \u2014 and there\u2019s no shortage of options to choose from.\n\nIf you redeem your Wells Fargo Rewards points for a statement credit, cash rewards, gift cards, online merchandise, Apple purchases, or PayPal rewards, you\u2019ll get back 1 cent per point. For example, using 1,000 points for any of these options would yield $10 in redemption value.\n\nYou can also book travel through the Wells Fargo Rewards portal, including flights, hotels, vacation packages, cruises, and attractions. However, the value is fixed and will get you 1 cent per point.\n\nIn our opinion, the absolute best way to redeem Wells Fargo Rewards points is booking award travel with transfer partners. While there\u2019s no set value here, it\u2019s possible to get anywhere from 1 to 10 cents per point of value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. How Much Are 2,500 Wells Fargo Rewards Points Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuations, 2,500 Wells Fargo Rewards points are worth $37.50.\n\nWhile 2,500 points aren\u2019t enough for a business class flight, you could redeem 2,500 points for:\n\n$25 in cash rewards at a Wells Fargo ATM (if you also have a Wells Fargo debit card)\n\n$25 in gift cards at retailers such as Sephora, Lowe\u2019s, and more\n\n$25 in online merchandise at participating stores, including Best Buy or Bass Pro Shops\n\n$25 in travel via the Wells Fargo Rewards portal\n\nThe last option is particularly interesting. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in booking a hotel night for $150 via the Wells Fargo Rewards portal. While 2,500 Wells Fargo Rewards points aren\u2019t enough for a free stay, you could shave off $25 of the final cost at checkout.\n\nBottom Line: We recommend saving up your points to have a larger balance to redeem for flights or hotels with Wells Fargo\u2019s transfer partners.\n\n7. What is the Value of 10K Wells Fargo Rewards Points?\n\nWe value 10,000 Wells Fargo Rewards Points at $150.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve earned a sum of 10,000 points, you could easily have enough to book a one-way economy ticket. For example, you can transfer 9,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points to receive 9,000 British Airways Executive Club Avios.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with the frequent flyer program, it has a distance-based award chart for redemptions. With those 9,000 points, you can redeem for one-way flights on American Airlines and Alaska Airlines that are 651 to 1,151 miles in flight distance. Going a step further, you can redeem 11,000 miles for flight distances of 1,152 to 2,000 miles.\n\nYou can book domestic flights with points. Image Credit: Katie Seemann\n\nThere are countless examples of short domestic flights that fall under this flight distance band. For example, transferring 9,000 points to British Airways Avios can get you from New York (LGA) to Chicago (ORD) or Miami (MIA) to Dallas (DFW).\n\nThese flights could retail upwards of $250 in many cases, so redeeming British Airways Avios can get you over 2.7 cents in value. And, you\u2019ll have 1,000 remaining Wells Fargo Rewards points for your next redemptions.\n\nOf course, there are other lower-value redemptions with 10,000 points. You can redeem those for $100 in cash rewards, $100 in gift cards, or $100 in travel booked through Wells Fargo Rewards.\n\n8. How Much Are 15K Points Worth?\n\nWe value 15,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points at about $225.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve earned 15,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points, you\u2019ll have more options to redeem rewards for great value. You can redeem British Airways Avios for transcontinental flights in economy, such as New York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) on American or Alaska.\n\nAnother great transfer partner to consider using is Avianca LifeMiles. The transfer ratio is 1:1, so 1 Wells Fargo Rewards point is equal to 1 Avianca LifeMile. As a member of the Star Alliance, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to book United Airlines flights for a solid price. For instance, a round-trip ticket from San Francisco (SFO) to Phoenix (PHX) will cost just 15,000 miles.\n\nLooking for hotel nights instead? Choice Privileges is the only hotel transfer partner at the time of writing, but Wells Fargo offers an extraordinary 1:2 transfer ratio. For every 1 Wells Fargo point you transfer, you\u2019ll receive 2 Choice Privileges points.\n\nBook hotel nights through the Choice Privileges program. Image Credit: Christine Krzyszton\n\nA bevy of brands fall under the Choice Privileges program, from Econo Lodge to Clarion. Better yet, reward nights start at just 8,000 points per night. By transferring 15,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points to Choice Privileges, you\u2019ll receive 30,000 Choice points, which can be enough for 3 free nights at budget-friendly hotels.\n\nFor more straightforward redemption ideas, you can use 15,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points to get $150 in cash rewards, $150 in gift cards, or $150 in travel booked via the Wells Fargo Rewards.\n\n9. What Is the Value of 20K Points Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuations, 20,000 Wells Fargo Points are worth $300.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to book premium cabin flights with as few as 20,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points. Remember our handy transfer partner, British Airways Executive Club? You can redeem 16,500 Avios for a one-way business class ticket for American and Alaska flights that are 651 to 1,151 miles in length.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a real-world example here. We found an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia (PHL) to Miami (MIA) in first class that costs $700 one-way. While you won\u2019t get a lie-flat seat, you\u2019ll get to sit up front in domestic first class by transferring 16,500 Wells Fargo Rewards points to British Airways Avios to book this ticket. That\u2019s a value of over 4 cents per point!\n\nWe love using British Airways Avios for domestic flights! Image Credit: Stella Shon\n\nIf you prefer to book hotels, transferring 20,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points to Choice Privileges can get you 40,000 Choice Privileges points. You can get as many as 5 free hotel nights thanks to the favorable 1:2 ratio.\n\nIn other cases, you can spend 20,000 points for $200 in cash rewards, $200 in gift cards, or $200 in travel booked through Wells Fargo Rewards.\n\nHot Tip: While you may not get amazing value for booking flights directly through Wells Fargo Rewards, you\u2019ll earn airline miles for the cost of the ticket. That\u2019s because these bookings are considered cash redemptions. Make sure to add your frequent flyer number to your booking to collect those miles!\n\n10. How Much Are 30K Rewards Points Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuations, 30,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points are worth around $450.\n\nHaving 30,000 points is enough to book a one-way flight to Europe with Wells Fargo\u2019s transfer partner, Air France-KLM Flying Blue. Points transfer instantly at a 1:1 ratio to the joint frequent flyer program.\n\nIf you can find saver availability, you can book flights from many U.S. cities to Paris or Amsterdam from 20,000 Flying Blue miles. Tack on another European city to the itinerary (like Rome or Barcelona), and you can book a one-way flight with a quick layover for under 30,000 miles.\n\nAir France 777-300ER economy class. Image Credit: Michael Y. Park\n\nYou can also transfer your Wells Fargo points to Choice Privileges to book a high-end stay with Preferred Hotels, which could easily be worth upwards of $1,000. Thanks to the 1:2 ratio, transferring 30,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points would get you 60,000 Choice Privileges points.\n\nYou can also use 30,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points for $300 in cash rewards, $300 in gift cards, or $300 in Wells Fargo Rewards bookings.\n\n11. What Is Our Valuation of 60K Rewards Points?\n\nAccording to our valuations, 60,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points are worth $900.\n\nThere are many ways to get outsized value beyond these estimations.\n\nBefore we dive in, it\u2019s possible to earn such a large sum of rewards with the welcome offer on the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey card: Earn 60,000 points after spending $4,000 in purchases in the first 3 months. Once you\u2019ve earned such a large sum of points, you\u2019ll get terrific value by transferring points to airline partners for international business class travel.\n\nThere are several ways to book international business class travel for under 60,000 Wells Fargo points. You could transfer 50,000 to 55,000 points to Air France-KLM Flying Blue and book a one-way business class flight to Europe, which routinely sells for $5,000 or more.\n\nBook business class to Paris for just 50,000 miles. Image Credit: Air France\n\nLikewise, Avianca LifeMiles has a sweet spot on one-way TAP Air Portugal flights between New York (JFK) and Lisbon (LIS). It\u2019s possible to book this business class ticket for just 35,000 miles and $27.80 in taxes and fees.\n\nOne of the lowest business class fares to Europe you\u2019ll ever find. Image Credit: LifeMiles\n\nYou\u2019ll have more than enough to book a one-way business class flight to Spain through Iberia Plus at just 34,000 points, and almost enough for the entire round-trip ticket of at least 68,000 points.\n\nAnother affordable way to get to Europe in business class. Image Credit: Iberia\n\nLastly, you could transfer 60,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points to get 120,000 Choice Privileges points. If you love luxury hotels, you could book more than 3 nights at a Preferred Hotels property \u2014 which could offer $1,200 or more in value.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use your 60,000 points for travel partners, you could get $600 in cash rewards, $600 in gift cards, or $600 in bookings made with Wells Fargo Rewards.\n\n12. How Much Are 80K Wells Fargo Points Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuations, 80,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points are worth $1,200.\n\nHaving 80,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points can take you on a one-way business class flight to the Middle East, Africa, or Southeast Asia. For example, you can transfer 70,000 points to British Airways Avios to book Qatar Airways Qsuite from New York (JFK) to Doha (DOH).\n\nImage Credit: British Airways\n\nAlternatively, you could transfer 80,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points to Choice Privileges and get 160,000 points. That\u2019s more than enough to book 5 nights at the Hotel Aquarius Venice, Ascend Hotel Collection, in Italy, which costs just 31,000 points per night.\n\nImage Credit: Choice Hotels\n\nOtherwise, those points would be worth $800 in cash rewards, $800 in gift cards, or $800 in Wells Fargo Rewards bookings.\n\n13. How Many Wells Fargo Points Equal a Dollar?\n\nPurely speaking in terms of cash rewards, you\u2019ll need 100 Wells Fargo Rewards points to get a dollar of value. You can get cash rewards from a Wells Fargo ATM if you have an eligible Wells Fargo debit card and receive a statement credit to your account, among other ways to get cash rewards.\n\nThe same principle applies if you\u2019re redeeming points for gift cards or travel booked through Wells Fargo. To get a dollar of value, you\u2019ll need 100 Wells Fargo Rewards points.\n\nAward travel is a bit different and will depend on the transfer partner you decide to leverage. It will range from anywhere between 10 to 50 Wells Fargo Rewards points to get a dollar of value.\n\n14. What Can You Use Wells Fargo Rewards Points For?\n\nWells Fargo Rewards points can be used for several redemption options. The only way to get outsized value greater than 1 cent of value per point is to transfer points to travel partners, while other options give you a flat rate of 1 cent apiece.\n\nTransfer points to airline and hotel partners, which include Aer Lingus AerClub, Air France-KLM Flying Blue, Avianca LifeMiles, Choice Privileges, British Airways Executive Club, and Iberia Plus\n\nwhich include Aer Lingus AerClub, Air France-KLM Flying Blue, Avianca LifeMiles, Choice Privileges, British Airways Executive Club, and Iberia Plus Cash rewards\n\nOnline merchandise at select retailers\n\nGift cards\n\nRedeem to your Wells Fargo account\n\nRedeem for purchases on your credit card statement\n\nPay with rewards at PayPal\n\n15. How Much Are Wells Fargo Rewards Points Worth for Travel?\n\nWhile we provide a lowball estimate of 1.5 cents per point when redeeming Wells Fargo Rewards points with transfer partners, the reality is that you can often get much greater value than our baseline.\n\nWhen booking business and first class award flights, Wells Fargo Rewards points can be worth at least 5 cents per point. Likewise, you can leverage the excellent 1:2 transfer rate to Choice Privileges to book hotels for at least 2 to 3 cents per point in value when booking luxury properties.\n\nHowever, when booking hotels, flights, car rentals, cruises, vacation packages, and attractions through the Wells Fargo Rewards portal, you\u2019ll only get 1 cent per point of value.\n\n16. How Much Are Wells Fargo Rewards Points Worth in Cash?\n\nWells Fargo Rewards points are worth 1 cent each for cash rewards. You can redeem rewards to your Wells Fargo account, redeem for purchases on your statement credit, and more.\n\nDepending on the redemption method, there may be a minimum requirement to get cash rewards. For instance, you\u2019ll need at least 2,500 points to get $25 in the form of a check. And, if you\u2019re getting cash from a Wells Fargo ATM with an eligible Wells Fargo checking account, you can only get cash rewards in $20 increments.\n\n20. How Many Rewards Points Equal a Gift Card?\n\nIn general, you can redeem Wells Fargo Rewards points at 1 cent each for gift cards. However, the issuer will often have sales on gift cards through the rewards portal, which can sometimes bring the value slightly up for these redemptions.\n\nYou can redeem your points for gift cards, but it\u2019s not always a good idea. Image Credit: Wells Fargo\n\nExpect 1 cent of value per point when redeeming points for gift cards. There will usually be a minimum and a maximum amount, depending on the retailer.\n\n21. How Much Are Rewards Points Worth When You Transfer to Partners?\n\nWells Fargo Rewards points can be worth a fantastic amount of money when you transfer to travel partners. You can get up to 10 cents per point when you do so.\n\nQatar Qsuite. Image Credit: Greg Stone\n\nOne example of this is to transfer 70,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points to British Airways Avios and book a one-way, $8,000 Qatar Airways Qsuite flight. You can score an amazing redemption value of more than 10 cents per point!\n\n22. Do Wells Fargo Rewards Points Expire?\n\nWells Fargo Rewards points will not expire as long as you keep your credit card account open and active and it remains in good standing.\n\n23. How Can You Maximize Wells Fargo Rewards Points?\n\nIn our view, the best way to use Wells Fargo Rewards points is to transfer them to airline and hotel travel partners. This is the only true way to maximize your rewards for incredible value.\n\nHere are some fantastic uses of Wells Fargo Rewards points:\n\nTransfer points to Choice Privileges at a 1:2 ratio for Preferred Hotels stays, including Cavallo Point in San Francisco, The Capitol Hotel Tokyu in Japan, and many more.\n\nTransfer points to Air France-KLM Flying Blue for business class flights to Europe on Air France, KLM, or Virgin Atlantic.\n\nTransfer points to British Airways Avios for domestic flights on American Airlines and Alaska Airlines or business class flights on Oneworld alliance partners like Qatar Airways and Qantas.\n\nTransfer points to Avianca LifeMiles for short-haul flights on United Airlines and Air Canada or business and first class flights on Star Alliance partners such as Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines.\n\nTransfer points to Iberia Avios to book economy, premium economy, and business class flights on the Spanish flag carrier.\n\nTransfer points to Aer Lingus AerClub to book economy and business class flights to Ireland and intra-Europe flights.\n\n24. Are Wells Fargo Points or Chase Points Better?\n\nIn terms of our valuations, Chase Ultimate Rewards points are better than Wells Fargo Rewards points. We value Chase Ultimate Rewards points at 2.0 cents each, while we value Wells Fargo points at 1.5 cents each.\n\nAlthough Wells Fargo has a neat 1:2 transfer partnership with Choice Privileges, Chase has 1:1 transfer partnerships with World of Hyatt and popular domestic airline programs JetBlue TrueBlue, Southwest Rapid Rewards, and United Airlines MileagePlus.\n\nIn contrast, Wells Fargo does not have any domestic airline transfer partners. However, leveraging international transfer partnerships is a fantastic way to get maximum value from your rewards.\n\nHot Tip: We recommend diversifying your points and miles stash. Many of Wells Fargo and Chase\u2019s transfer partners overlap, so it\u2019s good to collect more points in each program.\n\n25. Are Wells Fargo Points or Amex Points Better?\n\nWe value Amex Membership Rewards points at 2.2 cents each because it has the most transfer partners of any major program, whereas Wells Fargo Rewards points are worth 1.5 cents each. For those reasons, we argue that Amex points are better to have than Wells Fargo points.\n\nAmex has far superior airline transfer partnerships in which you can redeem points for maximum value. These programs include Air Canada Aeroplan, ANA Mileage Club, and Delta SkyMiles. The program also partners with Hilton Honors with an excellent 1:2 ratio, and a 1:1 transfer partnership with Marriott Bonvoy, which are more well known than Choice Privileges.\n\nIn our view, Amex points are much more valuable to have because of the seemingly endless ways to redeem them.\n\n26. Are Wells Fargo Points or Citi Points Better?\n\nWe value Citi ThankYou Points slightly higher (1.6 cents per point) than Wells Fargo Rewards points (1.5 cents per point).\n\nCiti also has the 1:2 transfer partnership with Choice Privileges, but an increased amount of international partners including Air Canada Aeroplan and Turkish Airlines Miles&Smiles.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAdding transfer partners brought Wells Fargo up to speed with competing credit card issuers, and it appears the bank is only just getting started.\n\nWhile we value Wells Fargo Rewards points at 1.5 cents apiece, it\u2019s more than possible to redeem them for anywhere from 1 to 10 cents or more per point.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to avoid any cash rewards, gift card, or online shopping redemption options if you\u2019re interested in high value. It might take some work, but it\u2019s well worth the effort to transfer Wells Fargo Rewards points to airline and hotel partners to book award travel via this route instead.\n\nWhile Wells Fargo Rewards points aren\u2019t the highest valued credit card points, the program already has some great travel partners that you can maximize now.",

Welcome Bonus Offer\n\nThe best way to earn a ton of Wells Fargo Rewards points quickly is to apply for one of the Wells Fargo credit cards above, meet the initial spending requirement, and earn the welcome bonus offer. It can take up to 1 or 2 billing cycles for these bonus Wells Fargo Rewards points to show up on your balance.\n\nThese welcome bonus offers will vary, and you can check out the latest offers above. It\u2019s possible to hold 1 \u2014 or even all \u2014 of these Wells Fargo cards in your wallet, though issuer application rules will apply.\n\nFor instance, Wells Fargo states: \u201cIf you opened a Wells Fargo Credit Card account within the last 6 months, then you may not qualify to open an additional Wells Fargo Credit Card account.\u201c\n\n2. Purchase Travel\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s definition of travel is quite extensive, meaning many travel-related purchases rack up bonus points.\n\nThe issuer defines travel as hotels, airlines, timeshares, rental cars, cruise lines, travel agencies, discount travel sites, and campgrounds. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the earning rates:\n\nWells Fargo Autograph card earns 3x points on all travel purchases .\n\n. Wells Fargo Autograph Journey card earns 5x points on hotels, 4x points on airlines, and 3x points on all other travel purchases.\n\nAs you can see, the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey card offers elevated rewards for the first 2 categories. Going 1 step further, it won\u2019t matter how you book your hotels and airfare, meaning you can book with third-party sites like Expedia or book directly with Marriott or United to earn a ton of bonus points.\n\nHowever, a couple of purchases, such as metro tickets, ride-shares, and parking fees, don\u2019t code as travel. Instead, Wells Fargo designates those as transit purchases. Only 1 card, the Wells Fargo Autograph card, offers elevated earnings on transit as you\u2019ll see in this breakdown:\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Card Rewards on Travel Rewards on Transit Wells Fargo Autograph Journey Card 3x points 1x points Wells Fargo Autograph Card 3x points 3x points Wells Fargo Active Cash Card 2% cash rewards 2% cash rewards\n\nHot Tip: The Wells Fargo Autograph Journey card comes with a $50 airline statement credit every year. It\u2019s incredibly easy to use, and better yet, no prior enrollment is required.\n\n3. Use Wells Fargo Travel\n\nYou can redeem Wells Fargo Rewards points for travel at a rate of 1 cent apiece. However, did you know you can also earn points by booking travel through the portal?\n\nLet\u2019s say that you want to book a $600 flight but only have 20,000 Wells Fargo Rewards points. This would not cover the entire cost of airfare, which would be 60,000 points on the portal.\n\nAnother strategy would be redeeming 20,000 points at booking and paying for the $400 remainder using your Wells Fargo credit card. You would earn Wells Fargo Rewards points on the remaining cost, coded as travel, depending on the card you hold.\n\n4. Dine Out\n\nMake dining out more rewarding by earning bonus points. Image Credit: Ehsan Haque\n\nBoth the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey card and the Wells Fargo Autograph card earn unlimited 3x points at restaurants, making them great choices for foodies. The issuer defines the restaurant bonus category as \u201ceating places and restaurants, drinking places, fast food restaurants, and caterers.\u201d\n\n5. Fill Up Your Tank\n\nThere aren\u2019t many credit cards that reward you for multiple everyday bonus categories \u2014 but the Wells Fargo Autograph card is certainly a rare find for gas purchases.\n\nThis $0-annual-fee card offers unlimited 3x points at gas stations, including automated fuel dispensers and electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nSCROLL FOR MORE Card Earning Rate on Gas Stations Wells Fargo Autograph Journey Card 1x points Wells Fargo Autograph Card 3x points Wells Fargo Active Cash Card 2% cash rewards\n\nWhat\u2019s more, you may be able to purchase gift cards at gas stations with the Wells Fargo Autograph card and earn the enhanced 3x bonus point rate.\n\n7.

Everyday Purchases\n\nOn all other purchases (excluding bonus categories stated above), the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey card and the Wells Fargo Autograph card offers unlimited 1x points per $1 spent.\n\nWhile it\u2019s nice that you\u2019ll still be able to earn points, you should turn to a card like the Wells Fargo Active Cash card for bonus rewards no matter where you spend.

However, do know that the primary cardholder is responsible for paying the balances on time and in full to avoid any interest or late charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWells Fargo Business Card Earning Potential\n\nFor many businesses, cash is king.

FS1 will carry the national broadcast with John Fanta and Jim Spanarkel on site to call the action. Ryan Fannon andwill be on the Villanova Sports Network on IHeart with the audio call (Fox Sports Philadelphia and Sirius XM channel 382).The Wildcats knocked off DePaul 59-49 on Wednesday night. It marked a second consecutive excellent performance at the defensive end, an area of intense focus for players and staff over the first two thirds of the 2024-25 regular season. In its last two outings, the 'Cats have surrendered just 55.5 points per game.One of the cornerstones of that effort is forward, a shot-blocker whose presence can play a huge role on the interior. The Fresno State transfer collected 10 rebounds at DePaul, his sxith double digit carom effort this season a team-high 6.5 rebounds per outing this season and the Wildcats are 5-1 when he grabs double digit rebounds in a game.\"DePaul really tries to spread you out to make plays,\" stated Villanova head coach. \"I thought he was able to stay in front of guys when he got switched on to them and force them into some tough shots. He rebounded as well. It was a great job by Enoch.\"Indeed, in Villanova's primary defensive structure, switches are common. Being able to help contain guards nearly a half foot shooter with quickness, can be a tall order for a forward of Boakye's size. Yet the Ontario native has held up well in that role.Boakye is also connecting on .577 of his field goal attempts and has started all 23 of the Wildcats' contest this season. The 6-10 forward averages 21.1 minutes and 3.9 points per outing.The Wildcats and Musketeers met last month at the Cintas Center. Villanova held a 58-55 lead before a four-point play by Ryan Conwell with 1:40 remaining in the game ignited a 14-5 burst that decided the contest. Conwell scored 34 points that night, the most points scored by a Villanova opponent this season.For Villanova, fifth year forwardis on the cusp of passing a group of Wildcats' legends on the program's all-time points list. Dixon (2,022) trails John Pinone (2,024), Allan Ray (2,025), Howard Porter (2.026) and Doug West (2,037). He enters the weekend ranked ninth on the all-time list.This is the first of two BIG EAST home games for the Wildcats in the coming days. Villanova will host No. 12 St. John's Wednesday night at Finneran Pavilion (6 p.m./FS1 and the Villanova Sports Network on IHeart).",

You can get even higher value \u2014 up to $1,080 or more by Business Insider's valuations \u2014 if you redeem your rewards through Chase transfer partners.\n\nCardholders like my mom earn 5 points per dollar on travel through Chase Travel\u2120 and 2 points per dollar on all other travel purchases. My mom also earns 5 points per dollar on Lyft rides through March 2025; 3 points on dining, online grocery purchases, and select streaming services; and 1 point per dollar on other purchases.\n\nMom can also transfer Chase points to airline and hotel companies such as British Airways, Hyatt, United Airlines, and Southwest. When she books travel directly through Chase, her points are worth 1.25 cents apiece \u2014 a 25% bonus over their redemption value elsewhere.\n\nBeyond the rewards, I feel good about my mom using the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card because it offers some of the best complimentary travel insurance of any credit card.\n\nShe gets primary car rental insurance whenever she rents a car and declines purchasing coverage through the rental agency. This means she can file a claim with Chase if her rental gets damaged or stolen instead of filing through her personal car insurance policy, which can increase her premiums.\n\nAs a cardholder, my mom is also eligible for trip delay insurance and baggage delay insurance through her Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card benefits. So if her flight is delayed past a certain amount of time or the airline loses her checked bag, she can get reimbursed for basic necessities such as a new toothbrush, change of clothes, or other reasonable replacement items.\n\nFinally, the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card comes with a 10% anniversary points bonus, and up to $50 a year in statement credits for hotels booked through Chase.\n\nWhat I love: Primary rental car insurance, generous travel credit, easy rewards\n\nWhat I don't love: Annual fee\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card Apply now lock icon An icon in the shape of lock.

However, both charge sky-high annual fees even if their benefits are worth far more.\n\nWhile airport lounge access is a dream for anyone, I often tell infrequent travelers to save some money by getting a card with a much lower annual fee and paying for lounge day passes as needed. If you find yourself buying more than two lounge passes each year, it might be time to consider an upgrade.\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae: Best Credit Card for No Annual Fee\n\nWhy I recommend the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae: The Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae is a top pick from my list of the best no-annual-fee credit cards, and it's particularly attractive since I have other credit cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae.\n\nMy Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae earns 5% cash back on Chase Travel\u2120 and Lyft purchases, similar to the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. It also earns 3% cash back on dining and drugstore purchases, and a flat 1.5% cash back on everything else.\n\nWhile this card is technically a cash-back credit card, I can transfer rewards from my Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae to my Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae credit card to use for business-class award flights or through Chase Travel\u2120 for a 50% value bonus.\n\nIt also comes with a generous introductory offer: 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months, then 19.49% - 28.24% Variable APR. This zero-interest period has been helpful when I make large purchases I plan to pay off over time.\n\nUnfortunately, this card charges foreign transaction fees, and I've paid more than I should whenever I accidentally use this card while traveling internationally.\n\nWhat I love: Great earning rates, no annual fee, and initial zero-interest period\n\nWhat I don't love: Foreign transaction fees\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae Apply now lock icon An icon in the shape of lock.

After all, both cards offer nearly identical benefits, and have similar reward rates and bonus categories.\n\nI have both cards, and actually utilize my Chase Freedom Flex\u00ae more often than my Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae. But the Chase Freedom Flex\u00ae is best for people who don't mind spending extra time and energy tracking 5% quarterly bonus categories \u2014 it's not as easy to maximize as the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae.\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, I highlighted credit cards that make your life easier, and the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae is simpler thanks to its flat 1.5% cash back on most purchases.\n\nIf you like the thrill of the cash-back chase like I do, the Chase Freedom Flex\u00ae might be right for you. Read more about this card in our Chase Freedom Flex credit card review. Like its cousin, this option also pairs well with other Chase cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae.\n\nBilt Mastercard\u00ae: Best Credit Card for Rent\n\nWhy I recommend the Bilt Mastercard\u00ae: The Bilt Mastercard\u00ae is best known as a great credit card for people who pay rent.\n\nRenters can pay rent with this credit card without incurring any transaction fees, and they even earn Bilt Points for doing so \u2014 on up to 100,000 points each calendar year.\n\nBut even non-renters like myself earn great rewards with this credit card. I got the Bilt Mastercard\u00ae because it earns 3 points per dollar on dining, 2 points on travel, and 1 point on most other purchases. (However, I have to make at least five purchases each billing cycle to earn rewards on this card.)\n\nFortunately, it's easy to use this card at least five times a month. I earn double points on the first day of every month, affectionately known as \"Bilt Rent Day\", on up to 1,000 points. I can also earn bonuses on Bilt Rent Day by playing trivia games and participating in various contests.\n\nDouble points don't apply to rent payments but do stack with other rewards such as bonus points on Bilt Dining. For example, I can earn 9 points per dollar on Bilt Rent Day if I go to a Bilt Neighborhood restaurant that earns 3 points per dollar spent and pay with my Bilt Mastercard\u00ae:\n\n3 base points for Bilt Mastercard\u00ae dining purchases\n\n3 points for Bilt Rent Day double points\n\n3 points for visiting a Bilt Neighborhood Dining partner\n\nPro tip: You don't have to be a Bilt cardholder to earn Bilt Points. Simply link any credit card to the Bilt app wallet to earn points on all eligible dining purchases.\n\nBilt Points have an average worth of 1.65 cents apiece, based on Business Insider's valuations. But they're even more valuable when transferred to travel partners like Alaska Airlines, which doesn't accept transferrable points from any other credit card. I can also book travel directly through the Bilt Rewards travel portal at a rate of 1.25 cents per point.\n\nThe Bilt Mastercard\u00ae also comes with generous benefits including primary rental car insurance, trip delay insurance that goes into effect after six hours, cell phone protection of up to $800 per claim which is subject to a $25 deductible, and no foreign transaction fees (rates and fees).\n\nWhat I love: Double point days and generous dining rewards with no annual fee\n\nWhat I don't love: Bilt Rent Day rewards are capped at a 1,000-point maximum\n\nRead our Bilt Mastercard card review to learn more about this card.\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card: Best Credit Card for Cash Rewards\n\nWhy I recommend the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card: The Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card earns a flat 2% cash rewards rate on purchases, and comes with a generous welcome bonus for a no-annual-fee card: $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nI recommend this card to anyone who's been considering one of the best cash-back credit cards (or the best Wells Fargo credit cards) because it's just so easy to use.\n\nWith the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, you'll never have to track which categories earn bonus points because everything earns 2% back \u2014 no more, no less. You can redeem Wells Fargo Rewards for statement credits, gift cards, travel, and more.\n\nI always appreciate a good zero-interest period, and this card delivers with a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 12 months from account opening, followed by a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card also comes with a wide range of benefits, including cell phone protection for up to $600 per claim.\n\nThis card does charge foreign transaction fees, so leave it at home on international trips.\n\nWhat I love: Flat-rate 2% cash rewards and 0% intro APR with no annual fee\n\nWhat I don't love: Foreign transaction fees\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card Apply now lock icon An icon in the shape of lock.

The Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card also appears in this guide later on, as our top pick for a good balance transfer credit card.\n\nThe primary difference between these two cards is that the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card offers a shorter 0% intro APR period that applies to both purchases and balance transfers, while the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card has a longer period of zero interest that only applies to balance transfers.\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Cash Back: Best Credit Card for 5% Cash Back\n\nWhy I recommend the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back: The Discover it\u00ae Cash Back is one of my newest cards, and I got it because I wanted a no-annual-fee credit card offering generous 0% intro APR terms that still earns rewards.\n\nThis card offers a longer-than-usual zero-interest period: 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers, then 18.24% - 27.24% Variable APR APR.\n\nWhile some cards offer longer periods with zero interest, few do so while still earning rewards as generous as the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back offers.\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Cash Back makes earning rewards extra fun, with quarterly bonus categories that change every three months (from January 1 to March 31, 2025, earn 5% cash back at restaurants, home improvement stores, and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). I use our Discover cash back calendar to help me track 5% bonus categories.\n\nThis card doesn't earn a traditional welcome bonus, but Discover will automatically match all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year for new card members.\n\nPro tip: If you're a student, there's a version of this card that's designed just for you.

Show Pros, Cons, and More chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.\n\nWhy I Didn't Recommend the Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card\n\nThe Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card was our previous pick for this credit card category, and it offers one of the longest 0% intro APR periods we've ever seen: 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers made within 120 days, followed by a 17.24%, 23.74%, or 28.99% Variable APR.\n\nHowever, the Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card doesn't earn any rewards, while the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back offers generous returns on certain categories. While our recommended card has a slightly shorter 0% APR period, it offers cardholders better returns in the long run and more long-term value.\n\nCiti\u00ae Double Cash Card: Best Credit Card for Balance Transfers\n\nWhy I recommend the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card: I spent a lot of time trying to decide between the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card and the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back, because both offer great benefits and very similar rewards.\n\nUltimately, I think the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card is best for people who want to make a balance transfer because it offers 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months, then 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR.\n\nCardholders do have to pay a 3% intro fee of each transfer ($5 minimum) completed within the first four months of account opening, then 5% of each transfer ($5 minimum). But the balance transfer fee is significantly lower than what you'd pay in credit card interest anywhere else.\n\nAs the name suggests, the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card also earns great rewards, which can be rare on credit cards with such a long zero-interest period.\n\nYou'll earn 2% cash back on all purchases: 1% cash back when you make a purchase, and another 1% cash back when you pay off what you owe. Rewards aren't capped, which is why this card also ranks on our list of the best 2% cash back credit cards.\n\nWhat I love: Super-long 0% intro APR period for balance transfers with no annual fee\n\nWhat I don't love: No 0% intro APR for purchases\n\nLearn more about this card in our Citi Double Cash card review.\n\nWhy I Didn't Recommend the Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card\n\nThe Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card is a sister card of the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card with an even longer zero-interest period for balance transfers: 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 21 months (transfers must be completed within four months of account opening) and on purchases for 12 months, then 18.24% - 28.99% Variable APR.\n\nHowever, the Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card doesn't earn any rewards, and I will always choose the option of earning 2% cash back over three extra months of no interest.\n\nIf you just want the longer option for a zero-interest balance transfer, read more about this card in our Citi Simplicity card review.\n\nBlue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express: Best Card for U.S. Supermarkets\n\nWhy I recommend the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express: The Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express is a fantastic household credit card.\n\nThis card earns 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets on up to $6,000 per year in purchases (then 1%) and on select U.S. streaming subscriptions, 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and on transit (including taxis, rideshare, parking, tolls, trains, buses and more), and 1% cash back on other purchases (cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit or at Amazon.com checkout). Terms apply.\n\nThere are several caveats, of course:\n\nThe 6% bonus only applies to the first $6,000 you spend at U.S. supermarkets each year; after you reach the $6,000 mark, you'll earn just 1% per dollar\n\nNot all streaming services are included in the bonus amount\n\nWhile transit expenses include train or subway fares and tolls, it doesn't include more popular travel spend such as flights and rental cars\n\nGas or grocery purchases from discount warehouses like Costco or Sam's Club don't count toward bonus cash back\n\nThe Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express is one of the few cards on this list with an annual fee after Year 1: $0 intro for the first year, then $95 (rates and fees).\n\nBut if you max out the $6,000 at U.S. supermarkets bonus each year, that's $360 of cash in your pocket \u2014 significantly more than the annual fee you'll start paying in Year 2.\n\nWhat I love: 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year) and select streaming subscriptions, 3% back at U.S. gas stations and transit expenses. Terms apply.\n\nWhat I don't love: Annual fee after the first year\n\nBlue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express Apply now lock icon An icon in the shape of lock.

But if you're a big foodie, read more about this card's pros and cons in our review of the Amex Gold Card.\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Priority Credit Card: Best Credit Card for Everyday Airline Benefits\n\nWhy I recommend the Southwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Priority Credit Card: Southwest is one of the most popular airlines for U.S. travelers, and the Southwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Priority Credit Card gives cardholders a serious leg up on benefits.\n\nThis credit card is Southwest's premium consumer card and comes with a $149 annual fee. But cardholders get an annual credit of $75 toward Southwest flights, which effectively halves the out-of-pocket cost of the annual fee.\n\nCardholders also earn generous anniversary bonuses, four upgraded boardings per year, a nice welcome offer, bonus points on Southwest flights and several other spend categories, and avoid foreign transaction fees.\n\nSouthwest will begin charging for seat assignments in late 2025. And while we don't know many details about this momentous change, cardholders will likely get exclusive benefits that everyday travelers do not. If nothing else, Southwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Priority Credit Cardholders will earn 3 points per dollar when paying for preferred seating.\n\nThe Southwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Priority Credit Card won't do you any good if you don't fly Southwest, of course. But if you do, this card can help you fast-track your way to elite status and the coveted Southwest Companion Pass, especially if you time your welcome offer just right.\n\nWhat I love: $75 annual statement credit toward Southwest travel\n\nWhat I don't love: Annual fee\n\nSouthwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Priority Credit Card Apply now lock icon An icon in the shape of lock.

In fact, many savvy travelers use airline credit cards exclusively for the carrier-specific benefits they offer, such as free checked bags and preferred seating.\n\nWe previously recommended the Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Platinum American Express Card as the best airline credit card for most travelers. However, an annual fee increase in 2024 made me reconsider whether it offers the best value for most of my friends and family.\n\nPeople often tell me that Delta is their preferred airline. But it isn't always the most affordable carrier, whether you pay with cash or Delta SkyMiles. And in most cases, cardholders still earn more and get better travel insurance protection by using a travel rewards credit card with excellent benefits such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card.\n\nLearn more about airline credit card pros and cons in our guide to the best airline credit cards.\n\nHilton Honors American Express Aspire Card: Best Credit Card for Top-Tier Hotel Elite Status\n\nWhy I think the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card is worth getting: You might wonder why my pick for the best hotel credit card has an annual fee of $550. That's a steep price to pay upfront, but savvy Hilton guests can whiz their way to top-brass elite status with this credit card.\n\nI had this credit card for many years and only gave it up because I transferred my loyalty to another hotel chain.\n\nMost premium hotel credit cards offer generous elite status that still requires a certain amount of spend to get to the very top. But the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card comes with automatic Diamond status \u2014 Hilton's very highest elite tier. You'll get late checkout, early check-in, free breakfast, and many other perks just by having this card (terms apply).\n\nThe card also comes with a solid welcome bonus of 175,000 Hilton Honors bonus points after you spend $6,000 in purchases on the card within your first six months of card membership (offer ends 4/29/2025), plus an annual free night award you can use at almost any Hilton worldwide \u2014 including the aspirational Waldorf Astoria brand, where reservations routinely average $1,000 or more each night.\n\nPro tip: Hilton recently forged a partnership with Small Luxury Hotels of the World, giving Hilton loyalists access to 600 new options.\n\nCardholders get up to $400 in annual Hilton credit (in semi-annual increments of up to $200) toward room service, spa treatments, or activities, as well as up to $200 in airline incidental fee credits each year (up to $50 per quarter) toward any carrier of their choice (terms apply).\n\nWhat I love: Automatic top-tier Diamond elite status, annual free night certificate\n\nWhat I don't love: High annual fee and Hilton-specific benefits\n\nLearn more about this card in our Hilton Aspire card review.\n\nWhy I Didn't Recommend a Marriott Credit Card or The World Of Hyatt Credit Card\n\nMarriott offers several great hotel credit cards, and I actually have three of them myself. However, I wouldn't miss any of the cards in my current arsenal, while I regularly think about the benefits I miss from my Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card even when compared to the top-tier Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u00ae American Express\u00ae Card.\n\nMarriott has one of the world's largest collection of hotels, so getting one of the best Marriott credit cards might be a good option for you if you don't travel to destinations with many Hilton properties to choose from.\n\nIf you prefer luxury and don't mind a smaller global footprint, you might consider Hyatt, which only offers The World Of Hyatt Credit Card.\n\nWhat is the Best Credit Card to Get?\n\nI always say there isn't a magical \"best credit card\" that works for every person.\n\nSome people prefer no-annual-fee credit cards, while others don't mind paying a hefty annual sum for premium credit cards with airport lounge access. Some value travel rewards credit cards, while others prefer to focus on cash-back credit cards.\n\nIf you're a foodie, you'll want to choose one of the best credit cards for dining, restaurants, and food in general. But if you're more of a homebody, you may want to focus on the best credit cards for buying groceries and the best credit cards for gas purchases.\n\nIf your credit score is lower than you'd like, you may qualify for some of the best credit cards for bad credit or seek a secured credit card, which can help you build credit and even earn rewards while you work toward a stronger financial future.\n\nIf you're a first-time credit card applicant or a student with minimal income, you may want to consider one of the best starter credit cards or the best student credit cards.\n\nI compiled this list of the best credit cards for benefits, rewards, and financial protection you won't get from paying cash or using a debit card.\n\nIt's impossible to name a single credit card that would be perfect for everyone's needs. But knowing what you want from your credit card can help you find your best option.\n\nI wrote this list for people like my parents, who just want to know what card they should use. Out of hundreds of credit cards on the market, these are the best options I've found. In fact, you'll find many of them in my own wallet.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Me: How I Chose the Best Credit Cards\n\nChoosing the best credit cards is a momentous task, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously. I regularly evaluate dozens of credit cards available to consumers and business owners, and update this guide on a monthly basis.\n\nIn addition to considering my own perspective and consulting with industry colleagues, I read popular forums such as Reddit and FlyerTalk to see what everyday consumers are saying about different card as well.\n\nI evaluated each of the cards in this guide \u2014 and screened out many others \u2014 against the following criteria:\n\nSimplicity: All of the cards on this list are easy for consumers to use and understand. While I regularly update several credit card guides for maximizing rewards and benefits, my list of top recommendations is meant to help people like my parents find an easy card to use for everyday purchases.\n\nAll of the cards on this list are easy for consumers to use and understand.

            "content": "Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo employees on a team that voted to unionize have hit another bump in their organizing efforts.\n\nThe employees, whose 21-16 vote to form a union was certified in December, have filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that Wells has wrongly refused to bargain with them.\n\nThe charge, sent late Thursday via Wells Fargo Workers United-CWA, the Communications Workers of America-affiliated organizing group, argues that the bank's decision to not bargain is unlawful.\n\nThe unit is part of the bank's conduct management intake team, a group of employees based in different parts of the country who review customer and employee complaints. In December, the unit became the first nonbranch team at Wells to approve a union.\n\nTwo weeks after the vote was certified, the $1.9 trillion-asset bank requested an NLRB review of the election, which has yet to be completed. Wells said in a letter to the CWA this week that because the results of the request haven't come back, the bank isn't legally obligated to bargain with the group, or provide requested salary and personnel information to union organizers.\n\n\"Of course, if after appeals are concluded, the CWA were to conclusively become the certified bargaining representative of the unit employees on the conduct management intake team, then Wells Fargo would meet its legal obligations to bargain in good faith and provide relevant responsive information to the CWA as may be requested,\" Wells' lawyers said in the letter.\n\nThe CWA countered in a Thursday letter to the bank's legal team that \"a pending request for review is an invalid basis for refusing to bargain\" and constitutes an unfair labor practice, per NLRB standards.\n\n\"We have no choice but to file an unfair labor practice charge,\" the CWA said in its letter to the bank's lawyers. \"We respectfully request that the company reconsider its unlawful course of action and fulfill its obligations to bargain in good faith and furnish the requested information to the duly certified representative for employees in the conduct management intake team.\"\n\nWells argued in its December request for review to the NLRB, seen by American Banker, that the NLRB regional director's certification of the union vote was \"arbitrary and unsupported by precedent.\" The bank claims that there were procedural flaws in the NLRB's handling of the vote.\n\nDiana Pena, a San Antonio-based investigations associate who voted to unionize the unit, said the group is frustrated by Wells' tactics.\n\n\"They keep pushing that they'll bargain in good faith, but they're not doing it,\" she said. \"It's going to be a challenge, but we're sticking to it. We're not backing down.\"\n\nThe vote last fall by members of the conduct management intake team came shortly after the bank laid off 11 of the unit's roughly four dozen employees. The organizing group accused the bank of engaging in unfair labor practices at that time as well.\n\nWells denied the allegation that employees were cut due to union-organizing efforts. Bloomberg News was first to report on the conduct management intake team's unionization efforts, the layoffs and the earlier unfair labor practice charge.\n\nThe crux of the bank's argument in the current dispute is that there were flaws in the voting process, due to eight of the unit's recently laid-off employees casting votes. The bank challenged the votes, but the challenge wasn't resolved before the tally was counted. Although the union was approved by a five-point margin even without counting the laid-off employees' ballots, Wells said the challenge should have been resolved before the count.\n\nThe NLRB issued a proposed stipulation to accept that the laid-off employees' votes wouldn't count, but Wells declined to accept the terms. The bank said that the NLRB then approved the stipulation without its agreement.\n\nWells said in its request for review that the stipulation should be reversed and \"the matter returned to the region for further processing.\"\n\nIn an email sent to the unit's employees on Thursday, a senior director at the bank wrote: \"We continue to believe that the NLRB process, honoring both your individual and our company's rights, will help us navigate a clear path forward.\"\n\nThe conduct management intake team plays a notable role at Wells, especially as the bank has wrestled with the aftermath of various compliance scandals.\n\nThe bank appears to be making progress in resolving its longstanding regulatory problems. In the last month, financial regulators have lifted three of the bank's consent orders \u2014 leaving five still outstanding, including the asset cap Wells has been shackled by since 2018.\n\nPena said she and fellow members of the conduct management intake team want to unionize due to concerns about the bank sending jobs overseas, benefits and salaries not rising in line with the cost of living and changes in their job protocols.\n\nIn September, 27 pro-union employees said in a letter to Wells CEO Charlie Scharf that the group was facing \"staffing issues, a lack of transparency in enterprise policies, inconsistent training and job-security concerns.\"\n\n\"We respect our employees' rights to vote for or against union representation, and we will honor the outcome of any certified election,\" a Wells spokesperson said in December, before the vote was certified.\n\nScharf said last spring that the company believes employees are best served by working with the bank, rather than unionizing. More than 20 of the bank's 4,000-plus branches have unionized in the last year, according to organizers.",

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology. 20 Years\n\nHelping You Live Richer Reviewed\n\nby Experts Trusted by\n\nMillions of Readers\n\nCertificates of deposit are financial products that pay a fixed interest rate over a set period of time. Wells Fargo offers CDs with daily compounding interest so you can watch your money grow without taking on the risks that come with many other investment options. Read on to learn everything you need to know to open a CD account with Wells Fargo.\n\nHow To Open a CD Account With Wells Fargo\n\nYou can open a Wells Fargo CD account online or in person at a local bank branch. Opening an account online is quick and convenient, but you\u2019ll have a wider selection of terms available if you open an account in person, including terms up to 120 months.\n\nYou can fund a Wells Fargo CD by:\n\nTransferring money from a Wells Fargo account.\n\nTransferring money from a non-Wells Fargo account using your account and routing numbers.\n\nUsing a check or money order.\n\nOnline Application\n\nWhen you open an account online, you\u2019ll need the same items as when you visit in person:\n\nID\n\nSocial Security number or ITIN\n\nMoney to fund your account\n\nIf you use a check or money order to open an online account, you must mail it in after completing your application.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll fill out an application on the website. This will include questions about:\n\nWhether you\u2019re opening an individual or joint account.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Wells Fargo banking customer.\n\nInformation from your driver\u2019s license or government-issued ID.\n\nCitizenship status.\n\nContact information, including address, phone number and email address.\n\nHow long you\u2019ve lived at your present address.\n\nYour occupation.\n\nAfter you fill out your information, you\u2019ll need to review and accept the bank\u2019s terms and conditions. It\u2019s important to read this fine print to avoid getting stuck with an account that doesn\u2019t match your needs. If you want to open a joint account, you\u2019ll have to provide information for both you and the other person on the CD to finalize the account set up.\n\nBefore opening your account, Wells Fargo may order a credit report, but this won\u2019t affect your credit score.\n\nIf you have questions or need help setting up your online CD account, you can call 800-869-3557 to speak to a Wells Fargo agent.\n\nIn-Branch Application\n\nTo open an account in person, visit a local Wells Fargo branch location. You\u2019ll need:\n\nA valid ID\n\nYour Social Security number or ITIN\n\nThe funds to open your account\n\nEvery Wells Fargo CD has a minimum deposit requirement of either $2,500, $5,000 or $10,000. You can use the Wells Fargo website to find a nearby branch location and make an appointment to open a CD account in person. While it\u2019s possible to show up at the branch, it\u2019s a good idea to make an appointment to avoid waiting too long for assistance.\n\nTypes of CD Accounts Offered by Wells Fargo\n\nYou can select from a wide variety of Wells Fargo CDs, all with different term lengths, interest rates and minimum deposit amounts. Broadly, Wells Fargo offers Special and Standard Fixed Rate CDs, which have advantages and disadvantages.\n\nStandard CDs offer the convenience of a lower minimum deposit and a fixed term length and interest rate. But the APY on this type of CD is typically lower than those on Special Fixed Rate CDs.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at both:\n\nFeature Special Fixed Rate CDs Standard Fixed Rate CDs Term lengths 7, 11 or 18 months 3, 6 or 12 months online; up to 120 months in person Interest rates More competitive Less competitive Minimum deposit $5,000 $2,500\n\nInterest rates vary and are subject to change anytime until you open the CD. Check the Wells Fargo website for the most current rates.\n\nWhen you open a CD account, you\u2019ll know exactly how much interest your money will earn over the term length. And you\u2019re guaranteed your initial deposit as long as you leave it in the CD for the full term.\n\nTerm lengths for CD accounts opened online range from three months to one year. If you link an eligible Wells Fargo banking account, you\u2019ll earn a Relationship Interest Rate. This rate is higher than the standard interest rate offered on CDs.\n\nWhen your Wells Fargo certificate of deposit matures, you\u2019ll have seven calendar days to close your account or make other changes, including:\n\nChanging the account term.\n\nMaking additional deposits.\n\nMaking withdrawals.\n\nMinimum Deposit Requirements and Terms\n\nDepending on the type of CD you open, your minimum deposit could be $2,500 or $5,000 or even $10,000. Special or promotional rate CDs tend to have higher minimum deposit amounts, but also typically offer a better interest rate.\n\nThe higher your deposit, the more interest you\u2019ll earn over the term of the CD. Similarly, a longer term results in more earnings, as interest is compounded daily.\n\nEarly Withdrawal Penalties and Terms\n\nIf you withdraw funds from the CD before its maturity date, Wells Fargo will charge an early withdrawal penalty fee. This fee varies based on the CD\u2019s term length and when you make the withdrawal.\n\nThe early withdrawal penalties are broken down below by term length:\n\n90 days or less: Penalty equal to one month\u2019s worth of interest\n\nPenalty equal to one month\u2019s worth of interest Between 90 to 365 days: Penalty equal to 3 months\u2019 worth of interest\n\nPenalty equal to 3 months\u2019 worth of interest Between 12 and 24 months: Penalty equal to 6 months\u2019 worth of interest\n\nPenalty equal to 6 months\u2019 worth of interest Over 24 months: Penalty equal to 12 months\u2019 worth of interest\n\nTo avoid early withdrawal penalties, consider opening a CD with a shorter term if there\u2019s a possibility you\u2019ll need the money soon. Shorter terms come with lower penalty fees, as well, so even if you unexpectedly have to take your money out, you won\u2019t be stung as hard.\n\nPros and Cons of Opening a CD Account With Wells Fargo\n\nAs with financial products from any institution, Wells Fargo CDs have pros and cons you should consider before you decide to open one.\n\nWells Fargo CD Pros:\n\nCompetitive interest rates\n\nAbility to open a CD online or in-branch\n\nTrusted national bank\n\nFDIC insured up to maximum limits\n\nWells Fargo CD Cons:\n\nLimited flexibility with CD terms\n\nRelatively high minimum deposits required\n\nPenalties for early withdrawals can be steep\n\nMust visit a branch to access full selection of CD options\n\nConclusion: Is a Wells Fargo CD Right for You?\n\nThanks to its fixed interest rate and set term, a CD lets you earn more interest than you typically would from a traditional savings account or checking account. It also allows your money to grow without the risk inherent to investments in the stock market.\n\nWells Fargo lets you pick from different term lengths, so you can find a CD that matches your needs. To open a Wells Fargo CD account, visit your local Wells Fargo branch or open an account online on the Wells Fargo website.\n\nFAQ Here are the answers to some commonly asked questions about Wells Fargo CD accounts.

Plus, with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, you\u2019ll earn your cash back all at once, not in pieces like you would with the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Although the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card has not traditionally offered a sign-up bonus, the card currently has this offer in effect: Earn $200 cash back after you spend $1,500 on purchases in the first 6 months of account opening. This bonus offer will be fulfilled as 20,000 ThankYou\u00ae Points, which can be redeemed for $200 cash back.\n\nIf you want to use your rewards for travel, the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card offers more options. That's because you can choose to convert your cash rewards into Citi ThankYou points and then use those points to redeem for travel, or transfer to a host of travel partners.\n\nAlthough both cards do offer introductory APR periods, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card wins out with an interest-free window for both purchases and balance transfers. The Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card offers an intro APR promotion only for balance transfers.\n\nAlliant Cashback Visa\u00ae Signature Credit Card\n\nAnnual fee: $0.\n\nRewards: 2.5% cash back on everything, up to $10,000 in qualifying purchases per billing cycle.\n\nSign-up bonus: N/A.\n\nAPR: The ongoing APR is 12.24% - 12.24% Variable APR.\n\nHow it compares with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card: If you meet the account balance requirement, the Alliant Cashback Visa\u00ae Signature Credit Card features rewards that can potentially top what most flat-rate rewards cards offer: 2.5% cash back on up to $10,000 in purchases per billing cycle, and 1.5% cash back on all other purchases after that. Although most everyday spending won\u2019t get you near the card\u2019s monthly cap, it does limit how much you can earn \u2014 especially if you\u2019re a big spender. By comparison, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card earns unlimited cash back.\n\nWhile the Alliant card could earn more rewards, that ability comes with a caveat: You have to maintain a minimum daily account balance of $1,000 in an Alliant High-Rate Checking account to earn the card's 2.5%-back. Cardholders who don't meet this requirement can only earn an unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases. There are no such balance requirements to earn rewards with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card.\n\nAnother caveat of the Alliant Cashback Visa\u00ae Signature Credit Card is the fact that you are required to join the Alliant Credit Union to get it. Although joining the credit union is as simple as becoming a member of an eligible charity, it's another hoop to jump through.\n\nThe Alliant Cashback Visa\u00ae Signature Credit Card doesn\u2019t charge a foreign transaction fee, whereas the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card does \u2014 which can make it costly to travel with.\n\nPayPal Cashback Mastercard\u00ae\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nAnnual fee: $0.\n\nRewards: 3% cash back on PayPal purchases, 1.5% back on all other purchases.\n\nAPR: The ongoing APR is 19.24%, 30.99%, or 33.99%, Variable APR.\n\nHow it compares with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card: Another potentially high-earning, $0-annual-fee flat-rate card is the PayPal Cashback Mastercard\u00ae, which offers 3% cash back on all PayPal purchases. However, it earns just a so-so 1.5% back on all other purchases. Plus, you\u2019ll only be able to earn those rewards if you have a PayPal account, and you\u2019ll have to redeem them directly into your PayPal balance. If you already have a PayPal account, this won\u2019t pose much of a hurdle. On the other hand, if you would prefer fewer restrictions and more flexibility when it comes to redeeming your rewards, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is a better bet.\n\nUnlike the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, the PayPal Cashback Mastercard\u00ae doesn\u2019t consistently feature an introductory interest-free period.\n\nSoFi Unlimited 2% Credit Card\n\nAnnual fee: $0.\n\nRewards: 2 points per $1 spent on most purchases, plus 3 points per $1 spent on travel booked through SoFi Travel.\n\nSign-up bonus: Earn a $200 statement credit welcome bonus after you spend $2,000 in purchases in the first 3 months of account opening.\n\nAPR: 10.99% intro APR on balance transfers for 6 months from date of first transfer, for transfers that post to your account by February 10, 2024. After the intro APR expires, your APR will be 28.24% Variable.\n\nHow it compares with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card: With the exception of higher rewards on very specific travel purchases, the rewards on the SoFi Unlimited 2% Credit Card are virtually identical to those you'll earn on the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card. For most people, choosing between the two cards will come down to whether you'd rather bank with SoFi or Wells Fargo.\n\nFidelity\u00ae Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card\n\nAnnual fee: $0.\n\nRewards: 2% cash back on all purchases.\n\nSign-up bonus: None.\n\nAPR: The ongoing APR is 13.99% Variable.\n\nHow it compares with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card: The $0-annual fee Fidelity\u00ae Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card earns 2% cash back on all purchases, but to get the full cash back, you must deposit rewards into an eligible Fidelity account. Unless you have a qualifying account \u2014 such as a retirement account, 529 college savings plan or an health savings account with Fidelity \u2014 you\u2019ll earn a paltry points value for non-cash back redemption options with the card.\n\nConversely, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card earns the same 2%-back rewards rate without redemption requirements. It also features a useful welcome bonus, unlike the Fidelity\u00ae Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card.",

            "content": "Wells Fargo (WFC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned +11.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Wells Fargo belongs, has gained 10.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share, indicating a change of -0.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.8%. This estimate has changed +5.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.79 indicates a change of +16.4% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Wells Fargo is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).",

(Preferred Rewards members, of course, get an even better deal.) But if you\u2019re willing to manage a card with bonus rewards categories, the Wells Fargo Autograph\u00ae Card comes out on top in terms of overall value, given its higher rates in so many popular spending categories.\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Miles\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

OpenAI\u2019s investments and partnerships, backed by the Stargate program, could indicate the US AI industry is racing to capture emerging markets amid the growing popularity of cheap and effective Chinese AI models like DeepSeek R1 and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 2.5. Altman reportedly admitted in South Korea that OpenAI \u201chasn\u2019t found a strategy yet\u201d to respond to DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cIndia is an incredible market for AI in general, for us too. It\u2019s our second biggest market after the US. Users here have tripled in the last year. The innovation that\u2019s happening, what people are building [in India], it\u2019s really incredible,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to do much, much more here, and I think it\u2019s (the Indian AI program) a great plan. And India will build great models.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, US stock futures retreated after Alphabet\u2019s Q4 cloud revenue missed estimates and AMD\u2019s disappointing data center sales forecast heightened concerns about a slump in AI momentum despite hefty R&D spending.

Just last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) terminated a separate 2022 order, which had required Wells Fargo to pay nearly $4 billion for widespread mismanagement in its auto lending, mortgage lending, and consumer deposit accounts.\n\nSince 2019, Wells Fargo\u2019s regulators have closed nine consent orders. However, the Federal Reserve\u2019s $1.95 trillion asset cap, which has restricted the bank\u2019s growth since 2018, remains. That enforcement action stems from Wells Fargo\u2019s notorious fake accounts scandal, in which employees, under extreme sales pressure, created millions of unauthorized accounts between 2002 and 2016.\n\nWhile the recent consent order terminations are a step forward, the Fed clarified that its 2018 enforcement action remains in effect. Wells Fargo cannot expand its assets beyond the cap until regulators are satisfied that systemic risk and governance issues have been fully addressed.\n\n\u201cThe termination of these enforcement actions does not affect the board's 2018 enforcement action, which addressed widespread compliance issues by restricting Wells Fargo's growth, and remains effective,\u201d the Fed said in a statement.\n\nThe end of the asset cap, however, may be on the horizon. In November, Reuters reported that Wells Fargo was in the \u201clast stages of a process to pass regulatory tests,\u201d citing unnamed sources who suggested the restriction could be lifted in the first half of 2025.",

The welcome bonus is easy to earn: $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first three months from account opening. And rewards can be redeemed as cash or used for travel through Wells Fargo Autograph transfer partners, newly announced in 2024.\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash Card Rewards\n\nWelcome Bonus\n\nNew cardholders can earn a $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first three months from account opening. This is a competitive offer for a no-annual-fee credit card, and the minimum spending requirement is easily attainable for most people.\n\nEarning Rewards\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card earns 2% cash rewards on purchases. It doesn't get any simpler than that, which is one of the biggest upsides of this card.\n\nRedeeming Rewards\n\nRewards earned on the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card are part of the Wells Fargo Rewards program, which offers several redemption options.\n\nRedeem to cover purchases charged to your card in amounts starting at $1\n\nRedeem for statement credits to a Wells Fargo mortgage, loan, or credit product account\n\nRedeem at a Wells Fargo ATM in increments of $20, although you'll need a Wells Fargo debit card to do so\n\nCash in your rewards for gift cards\n\nUse your rewards to book travel, including airline tickets\n\nTransfer points to airlines and hotels in the Wells Fargo Autograph transfer partners program\n\nMaximizing Rewards with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\n\nAs of 2024, cardholders can convert cash rewards to travel miles and points through Wells Fargo transfer partners. Transferable credit card points are some of the best rewards to earn because they allow you to book luxury hotels or premium-class airfare for far less than their cash value. For example, travelers regularly book $5,000 or $10,000 flights for less than 100,000 points, or thousand-dollar hotel rooms for less than half that cost in points.\n\nExpiration\n\nYour cash rewards won't expire if your card is open and in good standing, where you pay your outstanding balance on time. If you're late with a payment, you won't be able to redeem rewards until your account is out of delinquency.\n\nAnd, if you close your account, be sure to redeem your rewards before doing so. You'll forfeit any rewards in your account if you close it, unless you have another Wells Fargo Rewards card.\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash Card Key Benefits and Features\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is a no-annual-fee card, so it comes with fewer benefits than most premium credit cards. But the card does offer a handful of beneficial features, including Visa Signature credit card benefits and perks.\n\n0% Intro APR on Purchases and Balance Transfers\n\nNew cardholders are eligible for a 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 12 months from account opening, followed by a 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR.\n\nThis isn't the longest intro APR Wells Fargo offers available, since the Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card offers an even longer zero-interest period of 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers made within 120 days, then 17.24%, 23.74%, or 28.99% Variable. But if you're looking to save on interest in the short term, it's a very good deal.\n\nCell Phone Insurance\n\nIf you pay your cellphone bill with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, you're eligible for cell phone protection. This benefit is worth up to $600 per eligible claim of damage or theft, although a $25 deductible applies. You can make up to two claims per 12-month period.\n\nPro Tip: Most Wells Fargo credit cards offer complimentary cell phone protection with low deductibles.\n\n24/7 Concierge Service\n\nThe Visa Signature\u00ae Concierge can help you make travel or dining plans or provide other types of personal assistance. This benefit is offered for free 24 hours a day.\n\nEmergency Card Replacement\n\nIf your credit card is lost or stolen, this benefit can help you get a new card in hand within 24 hours.\n\nRoadside Assistance and Dispatch\n\nYou can take advantage of complimentary roadside assistance when you hold the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card. This perk is free for you to use, but you'll need to pay out of pocket for whatever assistance comes your way.\n\nThis benefit includes a phone number you can call for pay-per-use assistance when you're on the road. For example, you can call roadside dispatch for help with a flat tire, tire changes, or lockout service. The service call is free, but you'll need to pay the locksmith or vehicle repair company when they arrive.\n\nTravel and Emergency Assistance Services\n\nThis benefit is offered 24 hours a day in the form of an assistance hotline. You can use this hotline to get help with medical or legal referrals, emergency transportation assistance, emergency translation services, and more. As with roadside assistance, the phone service itself is complimentary, but you're responsible for any third-party costs.\n\nAuto Rental Collision Damage Waiver\n\nIf you pay for a car rental with the Wells Fargo Active Cash card, this coverage will reimburse the cost of replacement or repairs if your rental vehicle is damaged or stolen for an eligible reason. This benefit can be very valuable, covering up to $50,000, but there are many exclusions and conditions for eligibility so be sure you carefully read the fine print in your Active Cash guide to collision benefits.\n\nRental Car Coverage Exclusions\n\nIn order for a claim to be eligible, your rental must meet all of the following requirements:\n\nYou must pay for the full cost of the rental card with your Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card and/or rewards program associated with the card account\n\nYou must decline the rental company's collision loss/damage insurance.\n\nYour rental agreement cannot be longer than fifteen (15) consecutive days in the U.S., or thirty-one (31) consecutive days outside the U.S.\n\nCoverage is excluded on rentals in Israel, Jamaica, the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland\n\nSome countries or car rental agencies require a letter of coverage beforehand (call 1-800-316-8051 to get one, or visit the My Card Benefits page)\n\nMaximum coverage amount is $50,000\n\nAccess to the Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection\n\nCardholders can book through the Visa Signature Hotel Collection, a credit card hotel booking program, and receive additional perks, including:\n\nWhen you make a reservation through Visa Signature Hotels, you're automatically entitled to the following:\n\nRoom upgrade upon arrival, when available\n\nFree in-room Wi-Fi\n\nLate check-out upon request, when available\n\nComplimentary breakfast for two\n\nA $25 food or beverage credit\n\nFees\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card doesn't charge an annual fee. While no-annual-fee cards are common, it's rare to earn such a generous flat rate of return on purchases on a card that doesn't cost anything to keep in your wallet, especially since this card offers robust perks that can benefit any household.\n\nHere are some other common costs and expenses to keep in mind:\n\nNo Annual Fee\n\nThis card has a $0 annual fee.\n\nAPR\n\n0% intro APR: 0% intro APR on purchases and qualifying balance transfers for 12 months from account opening\n\nRegular APR: 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% variable APR\n\nForeign Transaction Fee\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is a great credit card for domestic use, but it does charge a 3% foreign transaction fee on international purchases, so this is not the card to bring with you on when traveling abroad. This fee may even apply if you are within the U.S., but purchase something online from a company that's based in another country.\n\nAdditional Fees\n\nAs with many credit cards, you may incur charges for balance transfers, cash advances, and late payments.\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash Cardholder Reviews\n\nTo add additional context to our Wells Fargo Active Cash card review, we scoured popular forums like FlyerTalk and Reddit to see what cardholders have to say about it. Here are some of the most common opinions we found.\n\nEasy Sign-Up Bonus (Welcome Offer)\n\nMany cardholders said they chose the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card for its intro bonus of $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first three months from account opening. The relatively slow spending requirement to earn the intro bonus makes it especially appealing.\n\nSome Redemptions are Capped or Limited\n\nUnlike some cash back credit cards, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card only has automatic or paper cash rewards redemptions in increments of $25. For those who don't plan on using the card very frequently, it could take a while to redeem cash rewards. However, there is a workaround: You can use rewards to erase purchases from your statement.\n\nGood for Flat-Rate Cash Rewards\n\nMany cardholders said they like this card's ease of use, and turn to it when they make purchases that don't fall under another card's bonus categories. No matter what you buy, you know you're getting 2% back on your purchase.\n\nApply for the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card Apply now lock icon An icon in the shape of lock.

This popular card is very similar, yet also has some major differences.\n\nThe Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card also earns 2% cash back, but in a two-step process: you get 1 point per dollar (1% cash back) when you make a purchase and another 1 point per dollar (1% cash back) when you pay it off. This earning structure already puts the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card at a slight disadvantage.\n\nWhere the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card shines is in its long intro APR on balance transfers. New cardholders receive a 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months, then a 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR, making it one of the best balance transfer credit cards. However, this zero-interest period only applies to balance transfers.\n\nThe Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card doesn't offer cell phone protection and Visa Signature Concierge, which you'll get with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card.\n\nFor a deeper dive into the differences between these cards, check out our Citi Double Cash card review.\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card vs. Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae\n\nIf you don't mind juggling a few bonus categories, the Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae could be a good alternative to the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae is one of Business Insider's top picks for the best credit cards available right now. Amongst many other benefits, new cardholders can earn additional 1.5% cash back on everything you buy (on up to $20,000 spent in the first year).\n\nPlus, you'll earn 5% cash back on travel booked through Chase Travel\u2120, 3% cash back on dining, 3% cash back at drugstores, and 1.5% cash back on everything else, with no limits. So if you spend a lot on travel, restaurants, and drugstores, you could earn more rewards with this card. It also offers a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months, then a 19.49% - 28.24% Variable APR.\n\nRead more in our Chase Freedom Unlimited card review.\n\nBest Cards to Pair with the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card's top strength is its 2% cash rewards rate across the board, which makes it great to use for purchases that don't earn a bonus with other cards. The best strategy is to pair it with another that earns a high rate of rewards in categories where you spend the most.\n\nFor example, if you spend a lot on groceries, gas, and online shopping, you could pair the card with the Blue Cash Everyday\u00ae Card from American Express, which earns 3% cash back at U.S. supermarkets, at U.S. gas stations, and on U.S. online retail purchases (on up to $6,000 per category per year, then 1%), and 1% cash back on other purchases (cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit).\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash Card Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIs the Wells Fargo Active Cash card a good credit card?

Senator Warren pressed the President to support the ongoing efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the main federal agency working to stop unfair debanking, and direct other agencies to use their authorities to bring an end to this practice. Senator Warren also released an analysis revealing the thousands of debanking-related complaints lodged by consumers in the last three years alone. More than half of these complaints were lodged against the four largest banks in the United States: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum, President Trump criticized the practice of debanking and underscored in a recent executive order that \u201cprotecting and promoting fair and open access to banking services for all law-abiding individual citizens and private-sector entities alike\u201d is Administration policy. In her letter, Senator Warren reiterated her willingness to work with President Trump, Chairman Tim Scott, and any other members of Congress to unrig the economy and improve access to financial services, including by bringing an end to unjustified debanking of American citizens and businesses.\n\nSenator Warren laid out five separate CFPB efforts that address the threat of debanking:\n\nProhibit financial companies from using contract clauses that allow for debanking based on free speech, political affiliation, or religious views.\n\nClarify that when data brokers sell certain sensitive consumer information, they are \"consumer reporting agencies\" under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, requiring them to comply with consumer safeguards. This would protect certain debanked consumers by providing them with an adverse action notice and a right to challenge the account closure.\n\nLimit bank overdraft fees, a key cause of debanking, to $5 or a fee that simply covers the bank\u2019s costs and losses. Banks can also extend overdraft loans if they comply with longstanding lending laws, including disclosing the interest rate.\n\nMake clear that discriminatory debanking, including for religious affiliation, can be an unfair act or practice under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, giving the agency additional authority to protect debanked consumers.\n\nSupervise large payment apps like PayPal and CashApp, enabling the agency to more easily weed out unlawful debanking practices on these apps.\n\nSenator Warren called on President Trump to empower the CFPB to move forward with these efforts \u2013 instead of halting all CFPB rulemaking, enforcement investigations, and litigation against lawbreaking financial institutions like Secretary of the Treasury and Acting CFPB Director Scott Bessent has done. The CFPB freeze conflicts with the Administration\u2019s stated goal of preventing debanking and lowering costs for American families. More Americans across the country will unfairly lose access to deposit accounts as a result.",

One concerns Wells\u2019 legacy mortgage servicing activities; the other touches its legacy Wells Fargo Financial business.\n\nThe former asserted that Wells and nine other institutions \u2013 which represented 65% of the servicing industry \u2013 engaged in a pattern of misconduct and negligence within their residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing businesses.\n\nAnd the latter alleged that Wells \u201csteered potential prime borrowers into more costly subprime loans and separately falsified income information in mortgage applications.\u201d\n\nThe Fed terminations come one week after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dropped a 2022 consent order against the bank regarding automobile and mortgage lending and consumer deposit accounts.\n\n\u201c[T]oday\u2019s news is another important sign that we continue to make clear, meaningful progress to resolve our historical matters,\u201d CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cWells Fargo is a different company today, and the resolution of these two longstanding Federal Reserve consent orders is another indication that our team is establishing the right processes and controls to meet our regulators\u2019 and our own expectations,\u201d Scharf said.\n\nWells is still subject to five consent orders, according to a count given by a bank spokesperson last week. That includes a 2018 Federal Reserve action that established its $1.95 trillion asset cap, which has cost the bank $36 billion in profits, according to a Bloomberg report from Monday.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets predicted Tuesday that that order would be lifted in 2025, potentially in the first half of the year.\n\n\u201cWe view [Tuesday\u2019s] news as a positive for Wells Fargo & Company as it demonstrates progress of working with the company's regulators,\u201d analysts Gerard Cassidy and Thomas Leddy wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\nThe Fed noted Tuesday that Wells\u2019 asset cap is unaffected by the terminations. A spokesperson for Wells had no further comment.\n\nThe bank\u2019s board of directors, in a securities filing last week, credited Scharf\u2019s leadership for, among other things, making \u201csignificant progress in strengthening\u201d Wells\u2019 risk and control infrastructure, which, it added, \u201cremains the Company\u2019s number-one priority.\u201d\n\nIn the same filing, the bank disclosed that Scharf\u2019s pay increased to $31.2 million in 2024.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against the other American bank stocks.\n\n2024 was a memorable year for America\u2019s banking giants. According to a recent report in the Financial Times, the seven largest banks in the country represented 56% of the industry\u2019s profits during the first nine months of the year, up from 48% during the same period in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 High Growth Financial Stocks To Invest In and 10 Best Bank Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nThe banking sector is also experiencing improved capitalization. In November, the Federal Reserve Board found that 99% of the country\u2019s banks reported capital above regulatory requirements. Moreover, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) noted a 3.5% increase in equity capital in Q3 2024, reflecting the upward trend in capitalization.\n\nGlobally, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s upgraded the overall outlook for the industry from negative to stable in December for the first time since 2023, citing interest rate cuts and monetary adjustments being made by the G-20 countries. The Federal Reserve announced three cuts last year, lowering the central bank\u2019s target interest rate to 4.25% and 4.5%.\n\nTrump\u2019s return to the White House has also raised optimism about lax regulations in the financial sector, which analysts believe can spur dealmaking activity in the banking sector. Reduced oversight and a business-friendly environment are also likely to boost revenue and loan growth, and subsequently improve banks\u2019 bottom line.\n\nThe U.S. president has also repeatedly demanded further reductions to the interest rate. Here is what he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 23.\n\nWith oil prices going down, I'll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise they should be dropping all over the world.\n\nWhile the general outlook for the banking industry looks promising for 2025, analysts also warn of the potential risks associated with ongoing geopolitical conflicts, which can have adverse effects on the global economy. Increasing trade tensions and protectionist policies can also hurt investment inflows.\n\nOn January 31, the White House announced that President Trump would move ahead with his planned tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, starting February 1. The 78-year-old has also threatened to impose tariffs on the EU, citing the bloc\u2019s treatment of the U.S.",

As of 2006, anyone over the age of 13 can be a Facebook user which is the company\u2019s primary source of income. As of 2022, the company claimed more than 2.9 billion monthly active Facebook users.\n\nFacebook, Inc filed for its IPO on January 1st 2012. The prospectus stated the company was seeking to raise $5 billion but it got so much more. The day before the IPO execs announced it would sell 25% more stock than it had previously stated because of the high demand. The company wound up raising more than $16 billion making it the 3rd largest IPO in history at the time.\n\nThe massive IPO valuation earned Facebook a spot in the S&P 500 in the first year of its public life. Although its valuation has deteriorated in the wake of scandal and consumer trends within social media, early investors were treated to gains in excess of 1000% at the peak of the stock run. Mark Zuckerburg retained 22% ownership in the company following the IPO, and 57% of the voting rights. As of 2022, those holdings were down to about 14% of the company and 54% of the voting rights.\n\nOver the years, Facebook acquired a large number of apps and other businesses that include but are not limited to Instagram and WhatsApp. The company changed its name to Meta Platforms DBA Meta in 2021 to reflect its business and mission better. The new name describes the metaverse and refers to the seamless social interaction provided by Meta\u2019s social media application universe.\n\nToday, Meta develops digital applications that allow people to connect with family, friends, businesses, and merchants through Internet connections. Applications are available for mobile, PC, VR, and smart homes.\n\nThe company\u2019s primary operating segment is the Family of Apps.

To entertain 10 people, consumers can expect to pay about $139, a 0.1% increase over 2024, Wells Fargo said.\n\nFor its fourth annual Super Bowl Food Report, Wells Fargo utilized NielsenIQ data to examine the prices of popular game-day ingredients and prepared items.

            "content": "Every published analysis of Well Fargo\u2019s Christmas-week decision to sell its longtime headquarters high-rise deep in San Francisco\u2019s financial district has missed the entire point.\n\nSpeculation has been rife that the huge California-centered bank plans to move its corporate headquarters out of San Francisco, where it been since Gold Rush days and the Pony Express era. Guesses for a new headquarters have included Minneapolis, Dallas, Charlotte and New York City, where Wells Fargo\u2019s president now keeps his main office.\n\nThat came about because Charles Scharf joined Wells Fargo from Bank of New York Mellon and didn\u2019t want to move. At the time, Wells Fargo had just completed a new \u201cbranch hub\u201d complex along the Hudson River and Scharf moved into it.\n\nSo talk of Wells Fargo shifting its headquarters is old stuff, since the company already has a very diffuse headquarters structure, with yet another major complex in Minnesota.\n\nThe \u201cexperts\u201d bemoaned Wells Fargo\u2019s shift in San Francisco and the upcoming sale of its 420 Montgomery Street building as a sign that California will soon be a has-been as a financial center. That\u2019s hokum.\n\nSo long as this state retains anything near its current stature as the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, it will need to have a significant banking structure even if bank leaders keep offices in other cities, too. Big banks like Wells and Bank of America, another California native whose nominal headquarters are now out of state (in Charlotte), will need big employee bases here.\n\nBut like other white collar industries including insurance companies, law firms and stock brokerages, they saw many of their workers \u2013 even at executive levels \u2013 switch to working at home during the Covid 19 pandemic. So the businesses no longer need as many employees in their offices as often as before. It translates to billions of square feet of vacant offices, even if Tesla, Space X and Twitter/X owner Elon Musk disapproves and wants to call his own workers back to their old cubicles.\n\nThat\u2019s not happening even at his companies, which have seen large-scale employee departures since Musk began making those demands. Example: Tesla last year saw a 44 percent departure rate among its executives, about five times the normal turnover rate for large corporations.\n\nThe Wells Fargo move has to be seen in its overall context, not merely as a banking move. (In fact, Wells officials said of San Francisco that \u201cThe city remains vital to us. It is very important to the bank.)\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is the same kind of real estate turnover that\u2019s affected other office-centric businesses. Wells Fargo in 2023 sold one of its major San Francisco buildings, at 550 California Street, for $45 million, taking a loss of more than $200 million from what it paid for that structure in 2019, just before the pandemic.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s experience is similar to what\u2019s happened to other office tower owners, with real estate investment trusts having lost billions of dollars when hundreds of tenant businesses left their old leases in the pandemic\u2019s dust, exiting as fast as they could.\n\nNow Wells is doing the same. Its workers will still come to an office sometimes. One common practice is to hold meetings and make plans at company headquarters, with workers carrying out those decisions largely from home offices.\n\nRecognizing this reality, state legislators last spring passed a new law making building conversions into apartments and condominiums far easier than before, almost automatic.\n\nThis is the best way yet devised to solve much of California\u2019s housing shortage, with new living units created in existing structures without altering the physical character of cities or neighborhoods.\n\nSo the Wells Fargo building sale and move actually is part of a trend, just not the trend many financial and real estate analysts think they\u2019ve spotted of yet another big corporation moving headquarters out of California.\n\nSure, Wells Fargo will have significant offices elsewhere; it has had many of them for a long time. But the trend that\u2019s really at work in this move is the switch from office-centric work environments to home offices, which has been underway now for almost five years.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.

According to a recent report in the Financial Times, the seven largest banks in the country represented 56% of the industry\u2019s profits during the first nine months of the year, up from 48% during the same period in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 High Growth Financial Stocks To Invest In and 10 Best Bank Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nThe banking sector is also experiencing improved capitalization. In November, the Federal Reserve Board found that 99% of the country\u2019s banks reported capital above regulatory requirements. Moreover, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) noted a 3.5% increase in equity capital in Q3 2024, reflecting the upward trend in capitalization.\n\nGlobally, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s upgraded the overall outlook for the industry from negative to stable in December for the first time since 2023, citing interest rate cuts and monetary adjustments being made by the G-20 countries. The Federal Reserve announced three cuts last year, lowering the central bank\u2019s target interest rate to 4.25% and 4.5%.\n\nTrump\u2019s return to the White House has also raised optimism about lax regulations in the financial sector, which analysts believe can spur dealmaking activity in the banking sector. Reduced oversight and a business-friendly environment are also likely to boost revenue and loan growth, and subsequently improve banks\u2019 bottom line.\n\nThe U.S. president has also repeatedly demanded further reductions to the interest rate. Here is what he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 23.\n\nWith oil prices going down, I\u2019ll demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise they should be dropping all over the world.\n\nWhile the general outlook for the banking industry looks promising for 2025, analysts also warn of the potential risks associated with ongoing geopolitical conflicts, which can have adverse effects on the global economy. Increasing trade tensions and protectionist policies can also hurt investment inflows.\n\nOn January 31, the White House announced that President Trump would move ahead with his planned tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, starting February 1. The 78-year-old has also threatened to impose tariffs on the EU, citing the bloc\u2019s treatment of the U.S.\n\n\u201cAm I going to impose tariffs on the European Union? You want the truthful answer or shall I give you a political answer? Absolutely. The European Union has treated us so terribly.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we sampled stocks from ETFs with exposure to American banking companies and our previous articles on the sector. From there, we selected the 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024. The 10 best American bank stocks to buy now have been ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Where two or more stocks were tied on hedge fund sentiment, we used a higher market cap as a tiebreaker between them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a financial services company that owns the Wells Fargo Bank, which is considered among the \u2018Big Four\u2019 banks in the United States.

The partnership is expected to commence in April 2025.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price surged by 46.5% in the calendar year, 2024, driven by its robust financial performance. In its Q4 2024 investor letter, Oakmark Fund highlighted that Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\u2019s share price continued its upward trajectory following Donald\u2019s Trump victory in the November presidential elections, as investors pin hopes on relaxed regulations under the new administration to stimulate dealmaking activities. The fund is confident that the bank\u2019s superior business mix and return potential will unlock further value ahead.\n\nOn January 15, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) posted better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with net income growing 47% from last year to reach $5.1 billion, translating to an EPS of $1.43 per share.

Meanwhile, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, abandoned a sister initiative, the Alliance for Net Zero, which brought together firms that collectively hold $130 trillion of assets under management.\n\nThe second great US retreat\u2014the first being Trump\u2019s 2017 withdrawal, which the subsequent Biden administration reversed\u2014will have an immediate impact on other international efforts to curb global warming. The US bankrolls 21% of the budget for the UN Climate Secretariat, which leads climate change negotiations. National and international spending by the private and public sectors combined reached $175 billion annually in 2021 and 2022, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nAt least a portion of this funding will disappear.\n\nAdditionally, Trump promises to erase the US\u2019s national emissions-cutting plan. Tax credits for C02-reduction projects, manufacturing targets for electric vehicles, and offshore wind leases could also be suspended. Some US states, such as California, claim they will continue their climate efforts.\n\nAmerican bankers are in a delicate position. They don\u2019t want to annoy elected Republican officials, who are feared advocates of the oil and gas industry, but at the same time they cannot alienate their EU clients. Companies must adopt stricter climate targets on the old continent to comply with European reporting rules.\n\nWill American banks risk losing these clients?

Previously, the Fed lowered the rate three times in 2024: in September, November and December. The Fed increased the rate four times in 2023 and seven times in 2022.\n\nThe changes haven\u2019t directly affected bank bonuses, but it could still be a good time to open a new bank account in case savings account interest rates fall. So you could take advantage of both a bank bonus and current APYs in a new savings account.\n\n\u00bb MORE: See what the Fed rate means for savings accounts\n\nAre bank account bonuses worth it?\n\nBank promotions can be worth the effort of opening a new account and adding money if the reward is substantial enough and the requirements aren't too difficult to meet. Before signing up for a new account to earn a bank bonus, understand the details including what fees might be incurred and how long you might have to wait for the bonus to be paid. If earning a bank sign-up bonus requires depositing more than $250,000 (which is the standard amount that\u2019s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.), you\u2019ll need to employ certain strategies to make sure that all your money \u2014 including funds over $250,000 \u2014 is protected.\n\nOur Nerds say: \"A cash bonus is appealing, but many checking accounts don\u2019t earn interest, so you could miss out on thousands of dollars (much more than the maximum bonus) \u2014 which you could earn by putting that money in a high-yield savings account instead. \"Earning the highest bonus amount offered on this list requires at least $500,000. Depositing more than $250,000 would put you over Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. coverage limits, so you\u2019d need to consider a strategy to protect all your money.\" - Ruth Sarreal, NerdWallet banking writer\n\nCheck out more things to look out for when considering a bank sign-up bonus.\n\n\u00bb Prefer an account that offers rewards beyond a sign-up bonus?

You are responsible for covering any tax liability. Learn more about taxes on bank bonuses.\n\n\u00bb Churning through accounts to get bonuses? Find out whether closing a bank account hurts your credit\n\nShould I have more than one checking or savings account?\n\nIt can be helpful to have multiple bank accounts \u2014 as long as you can meet the requirements and minimums in order to avoid fees.\n\nThe number of checking and/or savings accounts you should have depends on your individual situation. Married or partnered people, for example, might each want to have their own accounts in addition to one or more shared accounts. You might want to consider having accounts at different financial institutions for different purposes \u2014 such as having an account with a bank that works well for international travel if you\u2019re frequently abroad, or with the bank that handles your mortgage or other loans for more seamless payment transfers.

And PayPal Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer John Kim will leave the San Jose-based online payment firm in March, the company said in a Jan. 22 SEC filing.\n\nBy contrast, former JPMorgan Chase executive Ed Olebe will be the new head of cards and merchant services for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, the bank said in a Jan. 21 news release.\n\nWilliams, who was also chief executive of American Express National Bank, will pursue a leadership role outside of Amex, company CEO Steve Squeri said in a letter to employees included in the SEC filing, although the letter did not say what role he is pursuing.\n\n\u201cAnr\u00e9 will be transitioning the various components of his current role and has graciously agreed to stay on and work with me as Senior Executive Advisor until early November,\u201d the letter said. \u201cI will announce the reassignment of his current responsibilities shortly.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 duties \u201care being reallocated across various executive committee members,\u201d an Amex spokesperson said in an email.\n\nWilliams held multiple roles during his more than three decades with Amex, including president of global commercial cards and president of global merchant services, according to his LinkedIn page.\n\nOlebe will replace the retiring Ray Fischer effective immediately, Wells Fargo\u2019s news release said. Fischer apprised the bank of his intent to retire last year, the release said.The incoming executive held a variety of roles in JPMorgan, including head of co-branded cards, ultimate rewards and loyalty services, and president of branded cards, the news release said.Olebe also held leadership roles at Mastercard in the areas of digital payments as well as consumer credit, according to the release.\n\nOlebe worked for Mastercard for eight years and had prior experience at Amex as a director of products and partnerships before he moved in 2014 to co-found the software development company Grasp Mobile Commerce, where he was also the CEO, according to his LinkedIn page. He joined JPMorgan in 2016.\n\nThe details of Kim\u2019s departure from PayPal are not clear. He entered into a \u201cseparation agreement\u201d with PayPal, the SEC filing said, but the document does not elaborate. The filing said he qualifies for severance, bonus treatment and health benefits, among other things.\n\nSpokespeople for PayPal did not immediately respond to questions about the circumstances related to Kim\u2019s exit.\n\nKim was an executive vice president of PayPal for roughly two and a half years, according to his LinkedIn page. He joined the company in September 2022, just a few months before long-time CEO Dan Schulman announced in February of the following year that he would retire.\n\nBefore Kim worked for the payments company, he was president of the marketplace division at the online travel company Expedia Group and had been president for the home-stay company Vrbo as well as Homestay, his LinkedIn page said\n\nPayPal doesn't plan to appoint a new chief product officer, a spokesperson for the company said. \"We now have a strong bench of product and design leaders now in place within our customer-focused business units,\" the spokesperson said.",

That represents a 7.6% increase from the $29 million Scharf received a year earlier.\n\nThe package breaks down to $2.5 million in base pay, a $7.2 million cash bonus and $21.5 million in long-term equity, the bank said.\n\nWells\u2019 board of directors credited Scharf with driving strong financial performance, returning roughly $25 billion to shareholders and finding a desired mix of business units for the bank. The bank continued its de-emphasis of home lending in 2024, introduced five new credit cards, and grew its \u201cpremier\u201d offering for affluent clients, the board said.\n\nThe board also noted \u201csignificant progress\u201d in strengthening Wells\u2019 risk and control infrastructure, which, it added, \u201cremains the Company\u2019s number-one priority.\u201d\n\nScharf took control of Wells in 2019, not long after the Federal Reserve hit the bank with the $1.95 trillion asset cap, which remains in effect.\n\nWells was subject to more than a dozen consent orders when Scharf was appointed chief executive. It has resolved seven in the past five years \u2013 many connected to the fake-accounts scandal that has plagued the bank with regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe bank announced Tuesday that it had resolved a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau consent order over automobile and mortgage lending and consumer deposit accounts.\n\nWells Fargo is the third of the six largest U.S.-based systemically important financial institutions to disclose its CEO compensation for 2024. JPMorgan Chase disclosed last week that its CEO, Jamie Dimon, received $39 million for last year. That matches the compensation Goldman Sachs gave CEO David Solomon. Dimon\u2019s pay increased 8.3% from 2023; Solomon\u2019s, 25.8%.\n\nBank of America, Citi and Morgan Stanley are expected to disclose their CEO pay packages next month. In that respect, it remains to be seen if Scharf\u2019s pay will outpace that of BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, who \u2013 like Wells\u2019 chief executive \u2013 received $29 million in 2023.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson had no comment beyond Thursday\u2019s securities filing.",

With a market cap of $260.9 billion, the company serves physical stores, internet, and other distribution channels worldwide.\n\nShares of this leading financial services company have outperformed the broader market considerably over the past year. WFC has gained 54% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 23.3%. In 2025, WFC stock is up 12.2%, surpassing the SPX\u2019s 3.2% rise on a YTD basis.\n\nZooming in further, WFC\u2019s outperformance looks less pronounced compared to the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 26.4% over the past year. Moreover, WFC\u2019s gains on a YTD basis outshine the ETF\u2019s 6.6% returns over the same time frame.\n\nWFC's strong performance can be attributed to higher non-interest income, reduced expenses, and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. The company is focusing on improving its credit card platform, strengthening its corporate investment bank, and expanding its commercial banking business. WFC is also investing in branch upgrades and digital enhancements to provide a better customer experience. With a growing mobile user base and continued focus on customer service, WFC is positioned for future success.\n\nOn Jan. 15, WFC shares closed up more than 6% after reporting its Q4 results. Its EPS of $1.43 beat Wall Street expectations of $1.34. The company\u2019s revenue was $20.4 billion, missing Wall Street forecasts of $20.6 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect WFC\u2019s EPS to grow 5.8% to $5.84 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 25 analysts covering WFC stock, the consensus is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 15 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and nine \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is more bullish than a month ago, with 14 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 20, Phillip Securities analyst Glenn Thum maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on WFC with a price target of $85, implying a potential upside of 7.8% from current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $82.17 represents a premium of 4.3% to WFC\u2019s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $92 suggests an upside potential of 16.7%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

She said she even called the man back on that number.\n\nHe was telling her about Zelle transactions Heather says she didn't make.\n\n\"He didn't ask me to verify my account,\" she said. \"He was already in my account.\"\n\nNext, Heather says the caller sent her several texts.\n\n\"Each check would have a merchant number where it was going,\" she said. \"Please allow 24 hours for the money to be put back in your account.\"\n\nGet news, weather and so much more on the new FOX LOCAL app\n\nThe caller told Heather to cut her card in half, put it in an envelope, and a courier was on his way to get it.\n\n\"He told me Wells Fargo was really getting tired of scammers getting away with it,\" Heather said. \"It sounds silly now. He said they had special tools they could put the card in and trace back exactly where it was skimmed.\"\n\nTwo different couriers showed up.\n\nHeather wasn't home for the first one, who looked under the welcome mat.\n\n\"I made the mistake, I didn't cut the chip in half.

Instead, the thief or thieves, withdrew $2,500 from Kroger, $900 at HEB, and $1,000 from a Wells Fargo ATM.\n\nHeather says the thief was able to transfer her savings into her checking account. She says she lost more than $4,000.\n\nIn a letter to Heather, Wells Fargo states, \"We understand you unknowingly participated in a fraud scheme.

While the interest rate that JPMC earns on the balances that it maintains in its own accounts at the Federal Reserve has risen from 3.15% to 4.4%, JPMC\u2019s customers continue to earn a negligible 0.01% on their savings.\u201d\n\nThe two US senators also accuse the heads of Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Truist of keeping the interest rates their savings account holders earn at \u201cnegligible 0.01%\u201d despite the lenders generating between 3.15% to 4.4% on their Federal Reserve balances. The CEOs of PNC, Citi and US Bank are also accused of keeping interest rates on savings accounts at 0.02%, 0.03% and 0.05%, respectively, while generating more than three-hundredfold from their bank balances with the Fed.\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

            "content": "This analysis from Wells Fargo was written by Dr. Michael Swanson, Chief Agricultural Economist; Courtney Schmidt, Sector Manager; and Robin Wenzel, Group Head, Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute:\n\nOn the surface, the cost of celebrating the 2025 Super Bowl resembles the proverbial duck, representing a 0.1% increase in a year-over-year review.[1]\n\nFor a menu of food and drinks for 10 people including fan favorites, consumers will spend $139.1* This is virtually the same price paid in 2024, which was only about ten cents more. Since this is good news, then why the duck reference? Because on the surface, a duck looks serene cruising along, but underneath the surface, the duck is paddling like mad.\n\nAnalyzing the data from NielsenIQ, which tracks food scanned at retailers across the U.S., we found a surprising spread in prices for popular game-day ingredients and prepared foods. This current landscape means party hosts will be challenged to seek a balance between items that are more expensive and those that have dropped in price if they want to control their party budget.\n\nSo, why isn\u2019t there an overarching, easily understood theme that explains everything? The answer is, this isn\u2019t how the economy works. Consumers are faced with the new challenge of becoming \u201cfood fluent\u201d given ongoing price fluctuation.\n\nThe following chart shows the spread of fan-favorite, game-day food pricing, and it resembles a playground seesaw stuck in the middle.\n\nGiven this topsy-turvy food environment, it\u2019s important for shoppers to understand the dynamics of this year\u2019s game-day favorites. Let\u2019s start with an unexpected category: veggies.\n\nMost Vegetable Player (MVP)\n\nWhy start with veggies in a Super Bowl food report? Veggies are top of mind as recent data explains how GLP-1 drugs are shifting consumer preferences and shopping patterns, and they highlight the seesaw effect of this year\u2019s price terrain. Super Bowl party hosts will want to offer some healthy options and should monitor pricing across common dipping vegetables.\n\nIf broccoli sounds appetizing, fans are in luck with pricing down by 7.2% from 2024.[1] Sounds like a call for creative broccoli recipes. However, if cherry tomatoes are a top pick, shoppers will spend 11.9% more compared to this time last year.[1]\n\nAvocado point spread\n\nAvocados are having a seesaw moment as well. Fresh avocados are up 11.5% from last year, while prepared guacamole dip is up only 1.5% over the same period.[1] Despite the increased cost of fresh avocados, consumers can still save money in the end by making guacamole from scratch. Convenience of prepared foods comes at a price, and labor costs make prepared guacamole less of a bargain even with the increased fresh avocado price. We should also remember that a game-day crowd can consume a lot of guacamole with their chips.\n\nThe pricing madness isn\u2019t new to avocados and guac. One can look at different categories of avocado/guacamole dip and find double-digit, year-over-year price changes \u2014 both up and down. Avocado and guacamole pricing helps to emphasize that consumers must be attentive, savvy shoppers to get the most bang for their buck.\n\nChicken wing coin toss\n\nOne of the biggest ticket game-day menu items further illustrates the frustrating item-by-item price messiness. Unfortunately, chicken wing lovers are out of luck this year with prices up 7.2% versus last year.[1] Chicken wings have continued their unstoppable growth and popularity on American restaurant menus, thanks to consumers supporting higher wing prices. This combined explanation helps to illustrate that beneath the surface for every food sector, there are many moving parts not seen by the consumer. With this food-focused celebration, consumers will have a chance to vote with their wallets on whether the moving prices for chicken wings are worth the extra spend.\n\nLine of shrimpage\n\nStill within the protein sector, and on the other side of the seesaw, retail prices for whole frozen shrimp have come down 4.0% in 2025 compared to last year.[1] Why are shrimp prices down so much? Two big factors. First, the U.S. imports most of the shrimp we eat from a small set of countries that increased supply when shrimp prices increased around the COVID pandemic. Second, the U.S. retail shrimp demand softened as a result of higher shrimp prices. So, current lower shrimp prices are a rebalancing of these two big changes as the market works to balance the seesaw effect. And, while shrimp is two and half times more expensive per pound than chicken wings, some party hosts might wish to consider shrimp as the go-big, Hail Mary play for their Super Bowl spread.\n\nSnacking station\n\nChips to accompany the dips illustrate a similar dynamic at the all-important snacking station. The avocados for the guacamole are up in a noticeable way. But, fortunately, the tortilla and potato chips are down, helping to offset the combined items. The total cost of chips and guacamole dip is just two pennies higher than last year. Of course, it\u2019s easy to take the cost savings for granted and grumble about the fumble related to avocado prices. Just proves that even the little seesaws are balanced at the moment. Will there be additional forward momentum on cost savings for these categories for the rest of 2025? Stay tuned for Wells Fargo\u2019s Agri-Food Institute July Fourth report.\n\nBeverage instant replay\n\nSome may call beverages an instant replay of last year\u2019s costs, with both beer and wine seeing only minor 2% increases.[1] Per usual, shoppers can save on soda by opting in for two-liters, versus 12-ounce cans.\n\nFinal score\n\nSo, what\u2019s the winning game plan for the big game? You certainly could run a trick play with a massive tray of fresh broccoli. But, while saving a ton of money, your guests will likely throw a lot of penalty flags. The recommendation for the most budget-conscious party host is to plan an offensive strategy that involves paying the higher prices for one or two items to please your guests, with a defensive strategy that balances your costs with lower priced items. Happy guests are a winning outcome no matter which team winds up hoisting the Lombardi Trophy this year.\n\n*Data rounded to the nearest dollar.\n\n1.NielsonIQ, data as of early January 2025.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nConsumers hosting a Super Bowl party can expect to pay about the same for food as in 2024, with a sharp increase in meat prices offset by declines in frozen pizza and chips.\n\nA shopper buying food and drink for 10 people can expect to pay $139, a 0.1% increase over 2024, according to Wells Fargo\u2019s Super Bowl report.\n\nThe biggest food increases came in raw chicken wings, which are 7.2% more expensive, while avocados jumped 11.5% amid concerns about the threat of tariffs on imports from Mexico. But celery prices dropped 8.4%, broccoli declined 7.2% and shrimp fell 4% compared to 2024, according to the report.\n\nPrices for frozen pizza, another popular game-time meal, fell 3.7%. Tortilla chip prices declined 1.4% for snacks, and salsa dropped 1.1%.\n\nThe banking giant said this mix of positive and negative pricing is reminiscent of a duck: It looks serene swimming on a pond \u201cbut under the surface, the duck is paddling like mad.\u201d\n\nDr. Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist at Wells Fargo, told Food Dive in an interview that certain food categories are experiencing sales growth right now, but the volatility of the industry and consumer demand calls into question how long that can last.\n\n\u201cTake beef as a category.

He said because of this, consumers have become more choosy with their food purchases.\n\n\u201cIf people really like chicken wings, they\u2019re buying chicken wings,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cPeople are back to buying what they want.\u201d",

            "content": "Twenty-eight companies have already taken advantage of no-cost workshops held in New York City and Nashville to guide large employers in the design and implementation plan for neurodiversity initiatives within their organizations, offered through a partnership between UConn and Wells Fargo announced last year.\n\nEmployers in the greater-Boston area will have the next opportunity to join in on the program, presented by the Wells Fargo Center for Neurodiversity and Inclusive Employment at UConn, during the center\u2019s upcoming workshop scheduled for Feb. 5, 2025 in Boston.\n\nThe workshop will be hosted by Loomis, Sayles & Company, the global asset manager headquartered at One Financial Center in Boston.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to bring this groundbreaking program to companies in Boston and the Northeast,\u201d says Judy Reilly, the executive director of UConn\u2019s center. \u201cCompanies that have been struggling to get traction with neurodiversity initiatives are now mid-launch with their first neurodiversity internship program, engaging in company-wide education about autism and neurodivergence, and securing executive sponsorship with their workshop-developed business cases. They tell us that without the workshop, they would not have had access to the information they needed to make this kind of progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to host fellow Boston-area employers for this innovative workshop,\u201d says Melissa Partridge, director of community investments at Loomis Sayles. \u201cLearning how to create an environment that attracts and supports talented teams, including neurodivergent jobseekers and colleagues, enriches workplace culture by fostering diverse perspectives, creativity and problem-solving that drives success for everyone.\u201d\n\nThis series of one-day workshops \u2013 supported by a $3.75 million grant from Wells Fargo \u2013 aims to provide instruction to key leaders from Fortune 500 companies to help design neurodiversity initiatives end-to-end.\n\nThe goal is to help leaders understand what neuroinclusion in the workplace looks like, and then apply that knowledge as they map out a plan for hiring and employment practice changes for their companies that enabled them to better support people who communicate, behave, think, and work differently.\n\nThe workshops are relevant to any company that has 1,000 or more employees, according to the center. Participants can expect to develop a clear understanding of the barriers that many highly skilled autistic and neurodivergent individuals face in obtaining and keeping employment, to draft the business case to secure executive leadership support for this work, and to actually begin designing the components of their neurodiversity employment ecosystem within their organization.\n\nEstablished in 2021 with three initial industry partners \u2013 including Wells Fargo \u2013 the Center for Neurodiversity and Inclusive Employment at UConn quickly distinguished itself as a national leader on neuroinclusivity in employment. The center was renamed the Wells Fargo Center for Neurodiversity and Inclusive Employment at UConn in October 2024 in response to Wells Fargo\u2019s shoulder-to-shoulder collaboration, expertise, and generous financial support.\n\nFor neurodivergent jobseekers \u2013 people with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other cognitive differences \u2013 traditional hiring processes and a general lack of knowledge about neurodiversity on employers\u2019 parts can create obstacles to demonstrating their talents. They often experience higher rates of unemployment and underemployment.\n\nThe center\u2019s overall focus is on improving career outcomes for neurodivergent individuals, providing innovative employer education, and fostering better connections between job seekers and companies.\n\nThe center also leads a University and Community Council that helps other higher educational institutions support neurodivergent individuals and connects them with resources and tools to help support their employment goals as well as a Neuroinclusive Candidate Network that helps individuals connect with companies, mentors, peers, events, and resources to support their career journeys.\n\n\u201cWe have had overwhelmingly positive response from the companies that have participated in our workshops so far,\u201d Reilly says. \u201cThese group workshops offer organizations across the country an actionable, no-cost pathway to design their own practices that tap into the strengths of current and future employees with cognitive differences. What\u2019s really cool is that companies learn directly from the Wells Fargo team, whose award-winning neurodiversity program informs the workshop curriculum and whose lived experience provides invaluable insight and guidance to companies in a structured, sequential format they would not otherwise be able to access.\u201d\n\nAdditional employer workshops are currently being planned for later this spring, to be held in Houston, Texas; London; Washington, D.C.; St. Louis, Missouri; and Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCompanies interested in participating in the upcoming Boston workshop are encouraged to email neurodiversity.employment@uconn.edu.\n\nFor more information about employer training and workshops and other opportunities available through the Wells Fargo Center for Neurodiversity and Inclusive Employment at UConn, please visit neurodiversity-employment.org.",

            "content": "In contrast, large-cap stocks, particularly those in the S&P 500 have a strong operating leverage. Wagner noted that the S&P 500 is projected to see earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% in the following year, driven by revenue growth of only 5%. This operating leverage, he argued, was a unique characteristic of large-cap stocks and provided a compelling reason to favor them over small-caps. He explained that operating leverage amplifies the impact of revenue growth on earnings, which can lead to more significant returns for investors.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance on December 21, David Wagner, Portfolio Manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, provided a detailed analysis of the current market dynamics and his investment strategy. One of the key points Wagner made was his preference for large-cap stocks over small-cap stocks. This stance was particularly noteworthy given his extensive experience in small-cap investing and running a small-cap strategy for over a decade. Wagner explained that while small caps were not all equal, many passive small-cap investments include a significant portion of unprofitable companies. He cited data showing that passive small-cap investors often had 40% of their assets invested in companies that lacked profitability, which could be a significant risk in a volatile market.\n\nThe term \u201cblue chip\u201d originated from poker, where blue chips were the highest denomination of chips used in the game. In the early 20th century, the term was adopted by financial analysts to describe the stocks of large, well-established companies with a proven track record of success. These companies were considered to be the best of the best. Today, blue chip stocks are typically defined as the stocks of large, well-established companies that have a large market capitalization. These companies are usually industry leaders, with a strong brand, a diverse product or service offering, and a history of consistent profitability. Blue chip stocks offer a relatively low level of risk, particularly when compared to smaller, more volatile stocks. This makes them an attractive option for conservative investors, who are looking to preserve their capital and generate steady returns.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy Under $100 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy under $100.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWagner also highlighted the evolving nature of the S&P 500. He noted that large-cap stocks were increasingly benefiting from operational efficiencies and economies of scale, which were not as prevalent in small-cap or international markets. Small-cap stocks, he observed, were more service-oriented and often lacked the robust profit margins and revenue diversification seen in large-cap companies.\n\nWagner further emphasized that while operating leverage could work both ways, potentially leading to more pronounced negative returns in a downturn, it was currently working in favor of large-cap stocks. He forecasted that the market would see more \u201ctailed\u201d returns, meaning that the best-performing large-cap stocks would outperform more significantly, while the worst-performing ones would underperform more severely. This dynamic, he argued, made large-cap stocks an attractive investment option.\n\nBlue chip stocks continue to be a cornerstone of a well-diversified investment portfolio, offering stability, steady growth, and resilience in uncertain economic conditions. Therefore, the case for investing in these stocks remains compelling.\n\nWhy Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) Is the Best Blue Chip Stock to Buy Under $100?\n\nA team of bankers in suits, discussing the success of the company's banking products.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 12 best blue chip stocks to buy under $100, we used blue chip ETFs plus online rankings to compile a list of 25 companies.

The two executives will report to Wells Fargo\u2019s Head of Equipment and Vendor Finance, Amrita Patel.\n\n\u201cBen and James bring extensive finance experience, strong relationship-building skills, leadership abilities, and a history of delivering outstanding results that benefit our team and clients,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThey will play key roles in developing and expanding our capabilities and driving a better client experience as we deliver more digital solutions and simpler processes across the business.\u201d\n\nIn his new position, McCarrick will transition from his current Underwriter Senior Manager role, which he has held since 2016, to oversee and support a team of approximately 200 people focused on underwriting and originations across Equipment and Vendor Finance.

Buying Super Bowl fixings this year will cost about the same as last year, but the prices of individual products may seesaw, according to a Wells Fargo report.\n\nThis year, store-bought Super Bowl snacks will cost just 0.1% more than last year, according to Wells Fargo\u2019s analysis of Nielsen data. Food and drinks for 10 people, including chips, guacamole, beer and chicken wings, will cost about $139, just 10 cents more than last year\u2019s price.\n\n\u201cConsumers are faced with the new challenge of becoming \u2018food fluent\u2019 given ongoing price fluctuation,\u201d the report said. Grocery store prices are up 1.8% year-over-year, according to December\u2019s Consumer Price Index.\n\nThe price of chicken wings, one of the most popular game-day items, rose by 7.2% amid growing demand, according to the report.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly seen restaurants and fast-food restaurants dedicated to chicken wings,\u201d said Robin Wenzel, group head of the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute and co-author of the report.\n\nOn the other hand, another Super Bowl-friendly protein is becoming more affordable this year: Frozen shrimp is down 4% compared to last year, according to Wells Fargo. But shrimp is still two-and-a-half times more expensive than chicken wings.\n\nA shift toward healthier options\n\nAmericans are turning to healthier foods, increasing the prices of some dipping veggies. Cherry tomatoes and avocados saw the steepest price increases at 11.9% and 11.5%, respectively, because of unfavorable growing conditions, according to Wells Fargo. Seventy percent of the US tomato production is in Florida, where Hurricanes Milton and Helene have impacted 40% of crops, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Pepper and carrots also rose by 7.4% and 3.4%, respectively.\n\nIn addition to tougher growing conditions, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs are also affecting vegetable prices, according to the Wells Fargo report. Americans taking those drugs \u201cwant to make sure that they\u2019re getting enough fiber so we\u2019re seeing more vegetables being purchased,\u201d said Wenzel.\n\nBut a decline in snack prices has helped counter the rise in vegetable prices. For example, frozen pizza prices are down 3.7%. And while avocados may be more expensive, the tortilla chips that accompany guacamole are cheaper by 1.4% this year. The changes in the cost of chips and guac make the combination just two cents more expensive than last year, Wells Fargo reports.\n\n\u201cI see plenty of opportunity for people \u2026 to really save money this year compared to last year, to craft a menu that allows them to do that,\u201d said Wenzel.\n\nOne way is to avoid prepackaged products, which are becoming more expensive due to labor costs. This could mean opting for whole avocados for guacamole instead of a premade batch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing wages go up, which is a good thing, but those costs have to be picked up somewhere, so it\u2019s filtering through on the prices. And that\u2019s the same with a lot of the packaging and other supplies that go into making these foods,\u201d said Wenzel.\n\nBeer and wine are also up 2% this year, according to the Wells Fargo report. For non-alcoholic drinks like soda, she recommends buying two-liter bottles instead of 12-ounce cans for cost savings.",

The \"Itty Bitty Gritty\" comes dressed in a Flyers jersey, but customers can shop from a selection of costumes and buy belly button packs to switch up his look.\n\n\"One of the things that's so fun about Gritty is that he's got such a giant personality,\" said Christine Mina, senior vice president of marketing for the Flyers. \"He's got a lot of different costumes and his belly button changes and he squeaks and he is very interactive. We really wanted a plush that represented that.\"\n\nMina describes the concept as more American Girl Doll than Build-A-Bear. Shoppers won't necessarily pump stuffing into their Gritty plush, but they can outfit him in some of mascot's best-known costumes. His Thanksgiving turkey, St. Patrick's Day leprechaun, Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, Rocky and summer looks will all be available for purchase. Fans can also choose between a home, away or alternate Flyers jersey for their stuffed monster.\n\nGritty's Chaos Factory will sell other apparel and novelty items like hats and T-shirts. It will be open exclusively during Flyers home games, across from the Gritty's Chaos Corner seating bloc in Section 118.\n\nProvided image/Philadelphia Flyers Flyers fans can buy holiday outfits for their 'Itty Bitty Grittys' like Santa Claus and Thanksgiving turkey costumes.\n\nWells Fargo Center sees the store as part of the wider expansion of its retail options. In the fall, the arena opened two new clothing shops: Threads, focused on newer trends, and the Vault, a throwback destination. Mina said the team plans to keep rolling out collections tailored to specific audiences or \"timelines of our fandom\" with the help of its in-house retail staff, assembled almost two years ago.\n\nGritty, whom Mina describes as a consistent \"top performer,\" seemed like the natural next theme to explore. The Flyers mascot has remained an object of fascination since his 2018 debut, with the power to draw new crowds to the Wells Fargo Center.\n\n\"We often hear, 'I came here for Gritty, but then I experienced live hockey for the first time and now I'm a Flyers fan,'\" Mina said. \"... We've also noticed a lot of hockey fans from other teams will put Philadelphia on their list because not only do they want to see a game here at Wells Fargo Center, but they want to interact with Gritty as well.\n\n\"He's got a lot that appeals for kids coming into the game, but he also has a really large adult audience. So it's just a great opportunity for us to expose the game of hockey to a lot of new people.\"\n\nFollow Kristin & PhillyVoice on Twitter: @kristin_hunt | @thePhillyVoice\n\nLike us on Facebook: PhillyVoice\n\nHave a news tip?

            "content": "The cryptocurrency market remains a hotbed of innovation, and WallitIQ (WLTQ) is becoming a standout performer in this innovation trend. WallitIQ\u2019s (WLTQ) exceptional performance places it as a strong contender against established giants like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP), who are currently on bullish momentum.\n\nAccording to an ex-Wells Fargo analyst, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is well on track to performing a 50,000% surge for its holders and outperforming both Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP).\n\nWallitIQ (WLTQ) Gains Ground On Cardano (ADA) And Ripple (XRP)\n\nRecent market dynamics have seen WallitIQ (WLTQ) outpacing both Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) in investments, with numbers projecting a crazy overperformance above these two heavyweights in the coming weeks. However, this surge in interest isn\u2019t limited to its performance against Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). A look at the investment numbers highlighted by the ex-Wells Fargo analyst shows that crypto investors are starting to gravitate towards WallitIQ (WLTQ), especially now that the industry is seeing the steady integration of artificial intelligence.\n\nWallitIQ (WLTQ) is carving out its niche in the crypto space with a focus on artificial intelligence and decentralized finance (DeFi). The project\u2019s core strength lies in its ability to apply advanced artificial intelligence technology and machine learning to crypto wallets and crypto trading. Its market fit is already evident in its presale performance.\n\nThe WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale has been booming so much that some interested investors who were left behind in the previous rounds are now rushing into the current presale round. According to the ex-Wells Fargo analyst, who is one of the early investors in XRP, the interest in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale is due to its clear utility in the crypto industry.\n\nUnlike many ambiguous DeFi projects, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) DeFi platform is home to an advanced crypto wallet ecosystem and AI-altcoin that has use cases in and outside the crypto industry. This is why the presale has been doing so well, with hundreds of millions of WLTQ tokens sold in the past four weeks. At this rate, the price of the token is projected by the Wells Fargo analyst to piggyback on the interest in artificial intelligence and surge by over 50,000% for investors who invest now.\n\nWallitIQ focuses on improving decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As such, the platform has been able to create a digital wallet infused with functionalities like advanced security to protect against fraud, advanced technical data analysis for crypto investments, predictive analytics modeling, a Physical2Digital feature, and a crypto wallet management mobile app, just to name a few. Furthermore, the platform has been certified by the reputable blockchain security company SolidProof, which further adds to the interest around the presale.\n\nEx-Wells Fargo Analyst Highlights Cardano (ADA) And Ripple (XRP) Momentum Slow Down\n\nAfter a significant surge of 265% over a 30-day period, Cardano\u2019s (ADA) momentum has shown signs of weakening. The Average Directional Index (ADX) for ADA has declined to 19.4 from 33, indicating a diminishing trend strength. This suggests that while the uptrend persists, its intensity has lessened and there could be a consolidation phase around the $1 mark or slower growth from this price level.\n\nSimilarly, Ripple (XRP) has faced challenges in maintaining its upward trajectory on its way to creating a new price all-time high. This has seen its price decline a bit and the bulls are now tasked with holding above $3.\n\nConclusion\n\nWallitIQ (WLTQ) is now gaining ground against both Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) as both cryptocurrencies start to slow down in their rallies. For those looking to take advantage of the exponential growth, WallitIQ\u2019s (WLTQ) ongoing presale is the first step of action, according to an ex-Wells Fargo analyst.\n\nBy participating now, new investors can buy WLTQ tokens at just $0.0420 per token and position themselves to benefit from the 50,000% surge predicted by the ex-Wells Fargo analyst as WallitIQ continues to gain traction in the crypto market.

David make the date and let's do it.\n\n\"I'm doing for it, bro. Yeah.\"\n\nAhead of KnuckleMania V, McGregor had revealed to MMA journalist The Schmo that he was going to show up on random BKFC card and fight for the promotion.\n\n5 McGregor has held a huge influence over the bare knuckle scene since he became a minority owner of it in 2024 Credit: GETTY\n\n\"One of these days you'll just hear my music come onto the stage here in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship,\" McGregor said.\n\n\"I'll come out with me fists wrapped, with no gloves and fight out of nowhere.\n\n\"No promo, no nothing - just a random fight on the card - that could be what my future holds.\"\n\nFeldman, BKFC's founder, added fuel to the fire regarding McGregor's comments at the event's post-fight press conference.\n\n\"One more thing,\" he said before finishing on the mic.\n\n\"As I was walking out of the arena, Conor actually tapped me on the shoulder.\n\n5 McGregor became the first fighter to hold two UFC belts at the same time Credit: Getty\n\n5 After knocking out Alvarez in 2016 Credit: Getty\n\n\"He told me to make sure that I tell everybody that he's fighting Jeremy Stephens in BKFC.\n\n\"That's what he said.

The accounts are designed to make uninvested cash work by generating interest instead of just letting the money lay dormant.\n\nThe yields offered by these programs typically rise if the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates.\n\nBut the SEC says Wells Fargo and Merill Lynch short-changed advisory clients after limiting the yields paid out by BDSPs at a time when the Fed was in the midst of a rapid rate-hiking cycle.\n\n\u201cThe orders find that these firms or their affiliates set the interest rates offered in the BDSPs and that, during periods of rising interest rates, the yield differential between the BDSPs and other cash sweep alternatives at times grew to almost 4 percent.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe regulator also alleges that the Wall Street firms made bank on clients\u2019 uninvested cash by keeping BDSP yields low.\n\nSays Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement,\n\n\u201cCash sweep programs impact nearly all advisory clients, who often pay advisory fees on assets held in these accounts. These actions reinforce that advisory firms must have reasonably designed policies and procedures to consider their clients\u2019 best interest when evaluating potential sweep options for cash held in advisory accounts and to ensure that cash held in an advisory account is properly managed by financial advisers consistent with a client\u2019s investment profile.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo and Merill Lynch settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the regulator\u2019s findings.\n\nWells Fargo has agreed to pay a $35 million civil penalty while Merill Lynch is set to cough up $25 million. The firms also consented to be censured and to cease and desist from further violations of the Advisers Act.\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Headlining the event will be a hard-hitting affair between former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Lightweight champion, Eddie Alvarez, taking on ex-UFC Featherweight contender, Jeremy Stephens. In the co-main event, Ben Rothwell will challenge current BKFC Heavyweight champion, Mick Terrill.\n\nWhat\u2019s Hot:\n\nBKFC \u2018KNUCKLEMANIA 5\u2019 CHEAT SHEET What event is on tonight? BKFC KnuckleMania 5: \u201cAlvarez vs. Stephens\u201d Who is fighting tonight at BKFC KnuckleMania 5? Eddie Alvarez vs. Jeremy Stephens 165-pound fight is the five-round main event. What time does BKFC KnuckleMania 5? TONIGHT (Sat., Jan 25, 2025), beginning at 8 p.m ET. on YouTube. Where will BKFC KnuckleMania 5 take place? Wells Fargo Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. How can I watch BKFC KnuckleMania 5? \u201cPrelims\u201d matches begin at 8 p.m. ET on YouTube before the PPV main card start time at 9 p.m. ET on DAZN. How do I bet on BKFC KnuckleMania 5? Check out the latest lines at DraftKings.com Where can I get BKFC KnuckleMania 5 updates and results? Get full BKFC KnuckleMania 5 play-by-play updates and live coverage here!\n\nAlvarez hasn\u2019t exactly had the best track record since leaving UFC. Indeed, after racking up a 1-2-1 mark under the ONE banner, he turned his attention to the bareknuckle arena, signing with BKFC in 2023, and then defeating former UFC title contender, Chad Mendes, in his debut fight (watch highlights). He went on to lose his second fight against Mike Perry via corner stoppage (those highlights here). Now, \u201cThe Underground King\u201d will look to get back into the win column when he goes toe-to-toe against another former UFC heavy-hitter in Stephens. Speaking of which, \u201cLil\u2019 Heathen\u201d left mixed martial arts (MMA) in Nov. 2022, going 1-7-1 in his last night fights, which includes ending his UFC career with a record of 0-5-1. Under the BKFC banner, however, Stephens is undefeated (2-0), so he seems to have found a nice rhythm in his new home.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that both men have tremendous power in their hands, so this fight has the chance to either end early, or result in massive damage to the faces of both men if it goes the distance. Alvarez has tighter striking, though Stephens may have a very slight advantage in the power department. In the end, it will likely come down to who can absorb the most damage, sad to say. Either way, this fight will be an entertaining for as long as it lasts. That said, don\u2019t blink!\n\nOriginal Card vs. Actual Card:\n\nBryce Hall was scheduled to face Kevin Ferguson Jr. before \u201cBaby Slice\u201d was forced to bow out of the fight for unknown reasons. No late replacement was found, so Hall was eventually yanked from the event altogether.\n\nNew Blood:\n\nPat Sullivan will make his bareknuckle debut against Kain Tomlinson Jr., who is 1-1 in bareknuckle competition. Also, Cody Russell and Logan Tucker will make their debuts against each other in a 175-pound affair. Russell is perfect (3-0) on the regional MMA circuit, while Tucker is winless (0-1).\n\nPhil Caracappa had one fight under the Professional Fighters League (PFL) banner \u2014 a loss to Khai Wu in 2023 \u2014 before he decided it was time to see what it would be like to punch without gloves. His first test will come against professional boxer, Noah Norman, who is 3-0 and will also be making his BKFC debut.\n\nZedekiah Montanez is 5-0-1 in MMA and will make his debut opposite Brandon Meyer, who is 1-3 in BKFC. He has a notable loss to Anthony Pettis under his own MMA umbrella back in 2022. With two wins under the PFL banner, and going 5-0 in MMA overall, Itso Babulaidze will make his BKFC debut against Bryan McDowel, who won his own debut against Justin McDonald via first round knockout. Prior to that, he was on a three-fight losing streak in MMA.\n\nHow The Prelims\u2019 Look:\n\nRelated Loyal BKFC Commits To Capricious Connie\n\nIn the lone \u201cPrelims\u201d fight (watch it here), Joey Dawejko will take on Steven Banks. Dawejko is a professional boxer with a record of 28-13-4. Now, \u201cThe Tank\u201d will attempt to make a living off of turning people\u2019s lights off with his bare fists. Banks, on the other hand, is 3-2 under the BKFC banner, with one of those losses coming against the reigning Heavyweight champion (Terrill).\n\nWho Needs A Win Badly:\n\nBec Rawlings got off to a nice start to her BKFC career, winning her first three fights. Since then, however, she has lost three in a row and now faces a do-or-die situation when she goes up against Taylor Starling, who could also use a win since she is just 2-3 in her last five fights with the promotion. Realistically, neither woman will get released with a loss, but for their sanity and confidence, winning is a must.\n\nInterest Level: 6/10\n\nIn the co-main event, Terrill \u2014 a long-time bareknuckle fighter \u2014 will put his BKFC Heavyweight title on the line against Rothwell, a former 265-pound UFC contender. Terrill is 4-1 under the BKFC banner, which includes a big technical knockout win over Lorenzo Hunt in what was his first successful title defense (highlights here). Nine of his 10 wins have come by way of knockout, so he\u2019s all about getting the finish. As for Rothwell, he is pristine (3-0) under the BKFC banner, which includes his most recent technical knockout win (injury) over Todd Duffy in April 2024. While \u201cBig Ben\u201d never got close to UFC gold, he will have the opportunity at winning the BKFC strap in just his fourth fight.\n\nIn further Heavyweight action, Patrick Brady will face Zachary Calmus. Brady has one fight (a loss) under PFL\u2019s banner and is 1-0 with BKFC. As for Calmus, he has more experience with his bare fighting hands with a record of 5-3 with the promotion.\n\nAlso, Travis Thompson made his BKFC debut at the promotion\u2019s very first show back in 2018, racking up an even 5-5 record since then. His opponent, Zachary Pannell, meanwhile is 1-2 and has lost his last two fights.\n\nDustin Pague had a horrible run inside UFC\u2019s Octagon, racking up a paltry 1-5 record, losing his last four fights before getting the boot. He is 3-2 since signing with BKFC, and will look to get back into the win column against J.D. Burns, who is just 1-4 fighting bareknuckle. In a 175-pound bout, John Garbarino will go toe-to-toe with Apostle Spencer, who is 0-3 in his first three combat outings, which includes losing his BKFC debut via knockout last year.\n\nEnjoy the fights!\n\nBKFC \u2018KnuckleMania 5\u2019 DAZN Main Event:\n\n165 lbs.: Eddie Alvarez vs. Jeremy Stephens\n\nBKFC \u2018KnuckleMania 5\u2019 DAZN Co-Main Event:\n\n265 lbs.: BKFC Heavyweight Champion Mick Terrill vs. Ben Rothwell\n\nBKFC \u2018KnuckleMania 5\u2019 DAZN Main Card (9 p.m. ET):\n\n125 lbs.: Taylor Starling vs. Bec Rawlings\n\n265 lbs.: Patrick Brady vs. Zachary Calmus\n\n165 lbs.: Dustin Pague vs. JD Burns\n\n135 lbs.: Travis Thompson vs. Zachary Pannell\n\n175 lbs.: John Garbarino vs. Apostle Spencer\n\n165 lbs.: Pat Sullivan vs. Kaine Tomlinson, Jr.\n\n175 lbs.: Cody Russell vs. Logan Tucker\n\n135 lbs.: Phil Caracappa vs. Noah Norman\n\n155 lbs.: Zedekiah Montanez vs. Brandon Meyer\n\n175 lbs.: Itso Babulaidze vs. Bryan McDowell\n\nBKFC \u2018KnuckleMania 5\u2019 YouTube Prelims Card (8 p.m. ET):\n\n265 lbs.: Joey Dawejko vs. Steven Banks\n\n*Fight card, bout order and number of fights remain subject to change.*\n\nFor more BKFC news and notes click here.",

According to a release, under the terms of the agreement, the former Wells Fargo bank building will not be utilized for a tobacco and vape shop, and SP 103 LLC will instead seek to lease the building to a fast food restaurant tenant.\n\nSP 103 LLC, pursued legal action in 2024 when the Board of Adjustment upheld the Town's Manager's decision to deny a permit. Per officials, while the town believed this was the correct action, there was also a chance that SP 103 LLC could win the legal settlement against the Town of Cape Carteret.\n\nAccording to a release, as part of the settlement, the Town agreed to contribute $75,000 to SP 103 LLC in two installments, with the first half remitted upon execution of the settlement agreement and the second half remitted upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the fast food restaurant. The Town agreed to this payment to settle the case in order to a) guarantee that a tobacco and vape shop could not operate at the former Wells Fargo location, and b) because of the potential for the Town's legal expenses and damages to far exceed the $75,000 negotiated in the settlement.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners approved the settlement by a unanimous vote.\n\nThe Town's Unified Development Ordinance has since been amended to clarify that the tobacco and vape shop land use may only be permitted with a special use permit in the B-30 zoning district. This recent amendment provides the Town with additional, more legally defensible controls on this land use in the future, per a release.",

            "content": "Why you might want a different card\n\nThough it offers impressively long intro APR periods, the Wells Fargo Reflect card falls short when it comes to long-term value. It may also save you less overall on balance transfers than a card with lower fees and a shorter intro APR period.\n\nFees: High balance transfer fee can cut into savings\n\nDespite the very long intro APR offer, the Reflect card may not offer the best savings. When choosing which balance transfer card will help you save on interest, you should consider a card\u2019s balance transfer fee.\n\nYou\u2019ll pay a 5 percent (minimum $5) balance transfer fee on balances you transfer to the Reflect card, which is tacked onto your total balance. For instance, a $1,000 debt transfer has a $50 balance transfer fee, so you would have to pay off a total of $1,050 before the end of the offer period. A 5 percent transfer fee is not uncommon among balance transfer cards, but it is on the high end. The higher fee could add up to significant interest charges if you\u2019re transferring a large balance.\n\nA card with a lower balance transfer fee might save you more even with a shorter intro APR period. That\u2019s because 5 percent of your balance can easily be more expensive than the interest charges you\u2019d face from carrying a balance for a few extra months.\n\nTo see whether a longer intro APR or a lower balance transfer fee is right for you, try out Bankrate\u2019s balance transfer calculator and credit card payoff calculator.\n\nOther fees to keep in mind include a 3 percent foreign currency conversion fee and a late payment fee of up to $40. Luckily, though, you won\u2019t be charged a penalty APR.\n\nRewards: Limited long-term value\n\nIf you're looking for a balance transfer card that offers rewards on purchases, then this card is not for you. The Wells Fargo Reflect Credit Card's lack of a rewards program is its biggest disadvantage.\n\nThe card is a good option to pay down your debt, but a card that earns rewards on everyday purchases could help offset the cost of your balance transfer fee and provide long-term value. Rewards cards with intro APR offers on purchases can also earn rewards on those purchases, which improves the card\u2019s overall value as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re sure that you can pay off your transferred balance within the intro APR offer time period, and you want a card that offers rewards, take a look at the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card. This card offers a high flat cash rewards rate on purchases, a decent welcome offer and a solid (though shorter) intro APR period.\n\nPerks: Few benefits compared to other no-annual-fee cards\n\nBalance transfer cards aren\u2019t known for carrying a rich portfolio of benefits outside basics like FICO credit score access or account alerts \u2014 and the Reflect card is no different. While the Wells Fargo Reflect Card does offer cellphone protection and Wells Fargo Deals perks, these are not unique benefits.\n\nHowever, Wells Fargo cards are among the best for cellphone protection. Phone bills you pay with the Wells Fargo Reflect Card are protected against eligible theft or damage for up to $600 per claim \u2014 minus a $25 out-of-pocket deductible. You can file up to two claims per year for up to $1,200 in annual coverage. But this still might not be the most appealing perk.\n\nThe card also offers access to My Wells Fargo Deals, but these deals are mostly modest card-linked discounts with small rewards caps, so the value of these perks are fairly limited.\n\nThe Reflect card also carries a few standard Visa Traditional benefits, common to most Visa cards. But they aren\u2019t the most helpful benefits. If you want more network features, a few cards with shorter zero-interest periods feature cash back programs and Visa Signature or World Elite Mastercard perks.\n\nLearn more: Wells Fargo Reflect benefits guide",

Jerry Lara/Staff photographer\n\nWells Fargo Bank has agreed to pay more than $1.1 million to resolve claims that it assisted jailed ex-attorney Chris Pettit in his scheme to defraud his clients of tens of millions of dollars.\n\nWells Fargo, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest bank, did not admit any liability in agreeing to the settlement, which was approved Thursday by Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Craig Gargotta.\n\n\u201cThis is \u2026 less money than we wanted but also more than nothing,\u201d Scott Lawrence, a Dallas lawyer representing bankruptcy trustee Eric Terry, told the judge in arguing for approval. \u201cWe take the creditors\u2019 lack of objections to this as continued approval of our work on their behalf.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe litigation that led to the settlement is unrelated to a pending case 200 Pettit clients have filed against Wells Fargo and other banks in federal court in San Antonio. In that case, the plaintiffs say the banks knowingly assisted Pettit and his law firm in breaching their fiduciary duties to the clients.\n\nThat case may be the last, best hope for Pettit\u2019s victims to see any significant recovery. Creditors in the bankruptcies have submitted about $270 million in claims, but the recovery so far has been far less than that.\n\nPettit was a longtime probate, estate planning and personal injury lawyer who pleaded guilty to three counts each of wire fraud and money laundering related to the theft of millions of dollars from his clients. He is serving a 50-year prison sentence and has been ordered to pay $106.3 million in restitution to his victims, though it doesn\u2019t appear he has any significant assets remaining.\n\nAfter Pettit\u2019s scheme became public, he filed for bankruptcy protection for himself and his firm, surrendered his law license and shut down his law offices in San Antonio.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn the trustee\u2019s lawsuit against Wells Fargo, Terry learned that Pettit maintained several accounts at the institution \u2014 including an IOLTA account in New Mexico, even though he was never licensed to practice law in the state. Interest on lawyers trust accounts, commonly called IOLTA, are intended to be used by attorneys to hold clients\u2019 money for safekeeping until distribution.\n\nTerry uncovered at least $33 million of losses from the IOLTA account. He alleged about $3.5 million belonged to Pettit\u2019s firm. That figure represented the maximum recovery the trustee could have achieved if he prevailed.\n\n\u201cI would hate for anybody to be confused and think that we\u2019re settling \u2026 $33 million worth of claims for $1.125 million,\u201d Lawrence said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re settling what we view as the remaining claims against Wells Fargo, which we believe amount to about $3.5 million, again, of nonclient money that we alleged flowed through the IOLTA account.\u201d\n\nGargotta, the judge, had ordered the parties to arbitrate the dispute.\n\n\u201cWe fought hard,\u201d Lawrence told the judge. \u201cWe litigated with what we considered very capable and well-funded adversaries. Wells Fargo is not going to run out of money to pay its lawyers anytime soon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nGargotta said one factor to consider is a need to obtain a recovery as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cMany of the Pettit clients are elderly, senior citizens, and they\u2019ve lost a substantial amount of money,\u201d he said before approving the settlement.\n\nAfter giving his approval, Gargotta heard arguments from lawyers for Texas Partners Bank \u2014 formerly the Bank of San Antonio \u2014 on its motion to dismiss the trustee\u2019s lawsuit against it.

            "content": "Wells Fargo (WFC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned +8.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Wells Fargo belongs, has gained 10% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nWells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.8%. This estimate has changed +6.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.79 indicates a change of +16.4% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +7.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Wells Fargo.",

For that reason, deal activity has continued, and her team has been able to focus on doing what they do best, from ground-up construction to rehab transactions to resyndications.\n\n\u201cI always tell my team to count their blessings that they\u2019re in this space,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cHigher operating expenditures and development costs, and softening in LIHTC [Low-Income Housing Tax Credit] pricing are ongoing issues that the industry faced in 2024, and they put pressure on our developers in terms of capitalizing deals. But it was an opportunity for us to deploy our various capabilities in the space and show the power of Wells\u2019 platform.\u201d\n\nWith capital hopping on and off the sidelines at various points throughout the year, 2024 called for some ingenuity as well as creativity. Wells Fargo leaned into the multiple levers it can pull to get a deal over the finish line \u2014 levers that will likely prove necessary again as residual uncertainty trickles into 2025.\n\nFortunately for Wells\u2019 affordable housing borrowers, when private capital pulled back at various points in the year, government subsidies were still largely available, with different jurisdictions around the country continuing to deliver programming and dollars. That paired nicely with Wells\u2019 appetite for LIHTC, new market tax credits and historic tax credits, and its myriad solutions on the debt side, from bridge loans to cash-collateralized financing structures.\n\nA transaction highlight came in June, when Wells Fargo provided $256 million as part of a $332 million package to renovate an affordable housing complex in Staten Island. The transaction was Wells\u2019 first under the New York City Housing Authority\u2019s PACT historic tax credit, a program focused on private-\n\npublic partnerships to renovate public housing sites.\n\nRodriguez\u2019s CLI group provided an $86 million historical tax credit investment, a $55 million construction bridge loan and a $27 million letter of credit in the deal. Then, the Wells Fargo multifamily capital team \u2014 led by Peter Cannava \u2014 supplied an $88.1 million permanent loan comprising a $79.3 million Freddie Mac-backed piece and an $8.8 million New York City Housing Development Corporation enhancement.\n\n\u201cIt was a joint execution with Pete and his team, and is illustrative of \u2026 the platform and our ability to execute when things get a bit choppy,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, darling\n\nMultifamily has long been the darling of commercial real estate, and Cannava described affordable housing as \u201cthe darling within the darling\u201d during the same mid-November interview. Still, his realm, leading capital for the, well, mama darling, wasn\u2019t without its struggles in 2024.\n\n\u201cIt felt a little bit like a tale of two cities,\u201d he said, recalling the fervid fire of excitement back in January 2024 when the talk of all of the industry conferences was \u2014 what people thought would be \u2014 a more accommodative interest rate environment, with some hopeful souls even predicting seven cuts, bless their hearts.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of positive momentum, then the air quickly got sucked out of the room when the 10-year Treasury went north of 5 percent. With that went all the volume,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were extremely busy, quoting transactions, submitting deals to the agencies, the agencies were doing their job in providing quotes and providing liquidity in the marketplace \u2014 but nobody was executing deals. When I look at the first five months of 2024, our volumes were down tremendously, and we weren\u2019t alone in that, it was across the street. Then, all of a sudden, a light went on.\u201d\n\nThe illumination came toward the end of May. Clients were more willing to transact, and deals started closing.\n\n\u201cI think there were a lot of reasons for that,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cObviously, rates started to move lower, and the bid/ask spread between buyers and sellers on appropriate cap rates started to be determined. We had a gangbusters June, July, August, September and October. We executed just under $2 billion with the agencies in the month of October alone, and we haven\u2019t seen volume like that, frankly, since pre-COVID.\u201d\n\nThe uptick in volume still came with a side of volatility, and new uncertainty in the marketplace following the November election.\n\n\u201cWe saw the 10-year Treasury move tremendously higher shortly after the election results, but most economists that I\u2019m listening to are talking about more inflation,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s in store as we move into 2025? But, personally, I think we\u2019re going to still see a lot of volatility, a lot of headwinds and a lot of the challenges that Vanessa talked about.\u201d\n\nThe good news for affordable housing in 2025 lies in the demand equation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re short about 4 million affordable homes in this country, give or take, depending upon which study you look at,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cBecause of that, I think regardless of what side of the aisle that\u2019s being talked about, our businesses will continue to flourish, and we\u2019ll be able to continue to finance important affordable housing in 2025.\u201d\n\nA well-dressed man\n\nIt takes a village to accomplish the aforementioned feat, especially at times of market dislocation, but thankfully Rodriguez and Cannava have a partnership and friendship that goes back 15 years.\n\n\u201cPete was the best-dressed person in the room,\u201d Rodriguez said of their first meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s always dressed to impress.\u201d\n\nCannava was an investment banker at the time, and claims not to remember what he was wearing that particular day.\n\n\u201cA sharp suit and pocket square,\u201d Rodriguez interjects and laughs.\n\nCannava started his career financing affordable housing \u2014 both single-family and multifamily \u2014 on the investment banking side. He sat in Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s municipal finance group for almost 10 years before joining Wells Fargo in 2009. His vision at the time was to create an affordable housing platform that transcended more than just the bank\u2019s municipal finance group, but instead partnered with Wells\u2019 CLI and multifamily capital group.\n\n\u201cI saw a real need for people to think creatively about the problems we were dealing with in this space,\u201d he said.\n\nRodriguez got her finance start in San Francisco after attending the University of California at Berkeley. She spent a decade in New York following the Global Financial Crisis, which is when she met Cannava. Cannava had attended New York University, where he got his bachelor\u2019s degree in finance. While Rodriguez is one of five, Cannava has one brother. \u201cI was also the best dressed one growing up,\u201d he said and laughed.\n\nWhen they met, Rodriguez was financing some of the biggest affordable housing developers in New York. Cannava brought up the concept of taking tax-exempt bonds, putting them on Wells\u2019 balance sheet, and financing them in a more capital-optimized and more profitable way. That would lower the cost of funding to the bank\u2019s borrowers while also mitigating a lot of risk via public market transactions.\n\n\u201cThose conversations morphed into a business, and were the foundation not only of the building of our relationship, but also the fact we\u2019re now uniquely situated more than any other bank, with all of our affordable housing practices sitting in one business vertical in the corporate investment bank,\u201d Cannava said.\n\nRodriguez and Cannava report into Kara McShane, Wells Fargo\u2019s global head of real estate, and have agency lending, construction lending, debt, equity, and new market tax credits all within their universe.\n\n\u201cOur teams have worked together for lots of years, and there\u2019s a lot of deep expertise in our teams,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWe roll up through Kara, we\u2019ve got all the tools under us, and it really promotes collaboration. It aligns incentives, it allows us to best serve our clients. And we foster strong partnerships.\u201d\n\nNine lives\n\nThe year 2009 was an interesting time for the two to begin their partnership, with the world largely figuring out which way was up following the GFC. At the time, Wells\u2019 banking competitors were foundering and there was stress in plenty of portfolios, but it was also the beginning of a new cycle of real estate \u2014 and for Wells Fargo, which the year before had acquired Wachovia.\n\nAs such, it was a great time for Rodriguez and Cannava to put their stamp on the affordable housing and mixed-income space in New York City with a blank canvas before them.\n\n\u201cI think that the reason it worked really well with our teams coming together is we take a team approach to everything. It\u2019s a very inclusive environment and very collaborative, and I think clients see that,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cThe client always comes first, and always sees the team coming together to try to drive a solution. We\u2019re product agnostic, and I don\u2019t care if you know you need to use my business for this or Vanessa\u2019s business for that. At the end of the day, we want to get to the right solution for the client.\u201d\n\nCannava remembers an example of this approach in 2023.\n\nAt the time, banks were still grappling with Basel III changes in the regulatory environment. An important client of Wells\u2019 was doing a deal in Manhattan\u2019s Inwood, and looking for a five-year forward \u2014 a challenging, interest-rate-focused product to execute in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe came up with a structure that allowed us to use our balance sheet for the construction debt as a drawdown bond, and then we committed to a perm loan at the construction loan\u2019s closing \u2014 a 15-year perm with a five-year forward, so a 20-year maturity,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cWe also got Fannie Mae to provide enhancement to us at closing that would come in at conversion.\n\n\u201cIn order to do this structure, Vanessa\u2019s team couldn\u2019t be the LIHTC investor because of an esoteric rule in the tax law, so we actually partnered with another bank that had a relationship with this client, and brought them in as the equity,\u201d Cannava added. \u201cIt was a great execution, and the project is being constructed as we speak. It was a unique project, too, because it was a 50-50 market-rate and affordable project.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deal took a number of turns initially but ultimately it ended up where it needed to be. It was an example of us sitting down with our partners, the muni finance group, my equity team, my debt team, our agency team and asking: \u2018What\u2019s the best execution for the client?\u2019 and saying, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to stand down here, partner there, and bring this in here.\u2019 It was interesting to watch that deal get structured, because where we started isn\u2019t where we ended, but where we ended was the right place,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nDespite much of the industry being aflame the past five years, the focus on preserving and creating affordable housing thankfully hasn\u2019t waned, Rodriguez said.\n\n\u201cFrankly, what I\u2019ve seen is more institutional players coming into the market and buying up portfolios,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen more firms raising impact funds focused on affordable housing, preservation, sustainability and climate solutions. Affordable housing is in crisis. Any city you go to in America has a version of the challenge, and it\u2019s big. When times get rough, you could see capital move away, but I just didn\u2019t see that at all.\u201d\n\nInstead, Rodriguez has witnessed multiple forces rowing in the same direction, with stakeholders trying to be innovative with new programs and funding, and participating on boards, in conferences and in think tanks.\n\n\u201cThen, you see things like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, $20 billion of capital that has been awarded, much of which to some of our clients,\u201d Rodriguez said of the federal program. \u201cMany of our clients are part of the larger ecosystem that will deliver these funds, benefit from these funds, and try to deploy these funds. Examples like that are reassuring, frankly.\u201d\n\nAffordable housing was a key issue debated in the run-up to the presidential election, too, but only time will tell what changes in policy will be implemented under President Trump.\n\n\u201cI think that regardless of what side of the [political] aisle you are on, affordable housing is going to be something that we have to tackle now,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cThe ongoing debate is how to tackle it.\n\n\u201cThe tool that has been utilized the most, and it\u2019s really probably the best public-\n\nprivate partnership that has ever been created, is the private activity bond, which came out of the 1986 Tax Reform Act,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s driven LIHTC investment, tax-exempt financing and private developers working with government agencies to finance affordable housing. But it\u2019s a limited tool.\u201d\n\nPrivate activity bonds are allocated state by state, based on population, and the maximum amount of tax-exempt bonds a state can issue each year is capped. The federal government could increase that cap, or reduce the 50 percent test \u2014 which requires that at least 50 percent of a rental property\u2019s financing come from tax-exempt bonds \u2014 but \u201cthat\u2019s not necessarily a panacea,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is creating more tax credits to be sold, and there\u2019s only a limited tax credit investor base. So, you\u2019re basically going to just drive down pricing, and then who knows what happens with the corporate tax rate?\u201d\n\nThere have also been discussions in the past about not just increasing \u201ccapital A affordable\u201d \u2014 housing made affordable through subsidies provided by the government or another organization \u2014 tax credits, but also a middle-\n\nincome-type tax credit.\n\n\u201cWith this election and everything changing in real time, it remains to be seen if one of these [ideas] gets put forward, pushed forward, picked back up,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut I do agree with Pete \u2014 you\u2019ve got to address the supply and the demand sides, and there has to be discussions around the corporate tax rate changes and just putting more supply in the market.\u201d\n\nHousing honey\n\nMore generally speaking, multifamily remains the apple of many investors\u2019 eyes today, and that trend shows no sign of abating.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to all the major CEOs and CFOs at various banks, multifamily is not a place where people have been pulling back,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cIf anything, people are looking to try to find ways to add and grow their portfolios. It\u2019s been challenging, because there\u2019s not been much built. The number of new multifamily properties under construction is far less than it was in 2019, 2020 and 2021. There\u2019s undersupply and the need to build more. The banks are going to be a big part of that solution.\u201d\n\nFor Wells Fargo, multifamily has always made up a very large percentage of its book, and Cannava sees that trend continuing.\n\n\u201cDevelopers are positioning themselves to bring product online in 2026 and 2027 because there\u2019s going to be a demand, and not many units online,\u201d Cannava said.\n\nThe two big two elephants in the room \u2014 currently plodding in circles\u2014 are interest rates and the regulatory environment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Basel III Endgame [which increases capital requirements on major banking institutions in the U.S, resulting in less credit availability and higher financing costs] in its original form was very punitive for banks to lend construction dollars \u2014 and we saw what happened to some of the regional banks in 2024,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cSo, regulatory reform that makes it easier for banks to lend construction dollars will only help some of the issues that we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nFor now, there\u2019s still plenty of work to do.\n\nLast month, in New York, Rodriguez\u2019s CLI team closed a $24.9 million letter of credit for 1760 Third Avenue. The deal partially finances the repositioning of a 513-unit former college dormitory on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side into a 434-unit affordable building with 260 units set aside for formerly homeless individuals. A vital step forward in helping to address some of New York City\u2019s homelessness crisis, the city and state also provided $200 million in subsidy towards the trasaction.\n\nElsewhere, the team is celebrating other successes, including some with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a sector that we\u2019ve spent time on, and we\u2019ve built a bit of a practice around it with different segments of Wells,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWe worked with one of the largest HBCUs to deliver a health care building on one of the campuses, to deliver services to [those] medically underserved, and also education opportunities in nursing. We\u2019re in a time where we need this more than ever, especially in low- to moderate-\n\nincome communities.\u201d\n\nWells has also provided grant funding to strengthen housing access and affordability in native communities across Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, the Dakotas and Wyoming.\n\nThen, in Birmingham, Ala., it helped to deliver educational opportunities for both skilled trade careers and eventual homeownership. BuildUP Community School in Birmingham was one of six organizations to receive a grant of up to $3 million to expand programs aimed at making homeownership more accessible.\n\n\u201cThis is a space where we can reach different pieces of the financial system and the ecosystem beyond affordable housing. It\u2019s work that we\u2019re really proud of,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nYear in review\n\nThe past year has put even the most unflappable financiers through their paces and laid bare weak spots, but it\u2019s also underscored teams\u2019 strengths.\n\n\u201cThis might sound a little cheesy, but I mean it, because it was really a challenging year,\u201d Cannava said. \u201cThe proudest thing for me this past year was my team, and how dedicated they were to navigating such rocky waters and working together and collaborating. It\u2019s not been easy.\u201d\n\nAnd as the Wells teams get deeper into 2025, they\u2019re leaning into what they do best again, and keeping the goal in clear sight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty glass-half-full individual,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old, so I have to be positive. I feel that affordable housing touches too many communities, no matter what community you live in. You can live in a rich suburb, or you can live in a very blighted community in an inner city. We all see affordable housing impact this in different ways, whether we want our kids to be able to afford to buy homes in the neighborhoods that we live in now, or whether it\u2019s dealing with the immigration issue in inner cities. It\u2019s touching everybody, and I think that everybody realizes something needs to be done.\u201d\n\nCathy Cunningham can be reached at ccunningham@commercialobserver.com.",

            "content": "The Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is as straightforward as credit cards come: Customers earn an impressive 2% cash-back rate on all purchases without having to jump through hoops.\n\nNerdWallet rating NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team. The scoring formula incorporates coverage options, customer experience, customizability, cost and more. Learn More\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to earn simple rewards or maximize them, this $0-annual-fee card works well solo or paired with other cash-back credit cards.\n\nWhile the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card plays well with other cards, it may not jibe as well with your spending habits. Here\u2019s what you need to know to determine whether you should apply for this card.\n\nReasons to get the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for rewards credit cards to require a good credit score (a FICO score of 690 or higher). A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to identify the credit rating needed for approval for this card, but mentioned that the issuer considers a variety of factors not limited to the customer\u2019s credit score and income. Assuming you can qualify for it, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card can offer a lot of value.\n\nLow-maintenance 2% cash back\n\nThere aren't tons of cash-back credit cards that earn 2% on all purchases. There are fewer still that offer the full amount all at once or without extra requirements. The Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card, for instance, offers 1% when you buy and 1% when you pay off the bill. The Fidelity\u00ae Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card offers a 2% rewards rate only if you redeem rewards as a deposit into an eligible account.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card on the other hand, offers 2% back on everything without any strings attached.\n\nA healthy sign-up bonus\n\nA 2% cash-back credit card that offers an introductory sign-up bonus is rare. The Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is an exception. Wells Fargo phrases the bonus this way: \"Earn a $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first 3 months.\"\n\nAmong $0-annual-fee cash-back credit cards, that's a generous amount.\n\nA way to finance purchases or get out of debt\n\nThe Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card can provide some interest-free breathing room if you plan to make a large purchase or several small ones. It offers a 0% intro APR on Purchases for 12 months and 0% intro APR on Balance Transfers 12 months from account opening on qualifying balance transfers, and then the ongoing APR of 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR.\n\nIf paying down debt is the goal, the long interest-free period can potentially help you pay off your balance faster. The card has an intro balance transfer fee of either $5 or 3% (whichever is greater) per balance moved within 120 days of opening an account. After that, a fee of up to 5% or a minimum of $5 for each balance transfer applies. Weigh the cost of the fee versus the interest you\u2019ll pay over time to determine whether it\u2019s right for you.\n\nA cell phone protection benefit\n\nWhen you use the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card to pay your cell phone bill, you\u2019ll receive cell phone protection insurance, which can cover your phone if it is damaged or stolen. This means that you can save yourself the cost of paying your cell phone provider for insurance.\n\nIf you have coverage through a cell phone provider, though, the card's phone protection benefit acts as supplemental insurance for expenses not covered by your provider's policy. The benefit limit is $600 per claim (minus a $25 deductible), with a maximum of two claims per 12-month period. You must exhaust all other forms of insurance before using the credit card's benefit. Terms apply.\n\nSo, let's say your cell phone is damaged and needs to be replaced. In this scenario, you have insurance through your phone provider, but there's a $100 deductible you have to meet in order for it to take effect. You pay the $100 and get a new phone. Now that you've exhausted the primary insurance, the cell phone protection benefit on the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card can be used. You can receive $75 toward the cost of the deductible you paid \u2014 $100 toward the cell phone provider's deductible, minus a $25 deductible for the credit card's protection benefit.\n\nWhen you shouldn\u2019t get the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card\n\nEven though the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is a low-maintenance option that\u2019s easy to use, it may not be for you, especially if the following criteria apply.\n\nYou've opened a Wells Fargo credit card in the past six months\n\nIf you\u2019ve opened a Wells Fargo credit card in the past six months, you may not qualify for the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, according to the issuer\u2019s terms. Give yourself some padding between those applications to improve your odds of approval.\n\nYou want redemption flexibility, but not a Wells Fargo checking account\n\nWhen it comes to redeeming cash back, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is best suited for Wells Fargo members with an eligible checking or savings account.\n\nWays to redeem cash If you don't have an eligible Wells Fargo bank account If you do have an eligible Wells Fargo bank account A statement credit Yes Yes A retroactive credit to cover purchases you already made Yes Yes Direct deposit No Yes Using a Wells Fargo debit or ATM card to get cash from a Wells Fargo ATM (must be in $20 increments) No Yes\n\nIf redemption flexibility is important to you, consider the Citi Double Cash\u00ae Card. It allows you to redeem for a check, statement credit, ThankYou points or a deposit into a checking account from which you\u2019ve paid a Citi credit card bill at least two times.\n\nYou tend to carry a balance\n\nIf you\u2019re in the habit of keeping an ongoing balance on your credit cards, a rewards credit card like the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card isn't right for you. The high ongoing interest rate will cancel out the value of any rewards earned. When maintaining a balance is your norm, consider a low-interest credit card to save more money over time.\n\nYou're seeking travel features and benefits\n\nIf you plan to travel frequently with the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, the 3% foreign transaction fee will get expensive. This fee is charged on every international transaction you make, as well as ones you make online with foreign merchants.",

            "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Wells Fargo (WFC), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Wells Fargo currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if WFC is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this biggest U.S. mortgage lender holds up.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor WFC, shares are up 10.18% over the past week while the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry is up 7.51% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.74% compares favorably with the industry's 6.16% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Wells Fargo have risen 19.22%, and are up 58.49% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 3.62% and 26.55%, respectively.",

            "content": "by Derek Oswald\n\nLast Updated on\n\nAfter being a fan of Incubus for over 20 years and of Coheed and Cambria for five years, I finally saw both bands live for the first time this past Tuesday, August 27th. The atmosphere in the parking lot was electric, fueled by the energy of a Philadelphia Phillies game happening just down the road (GO PHILS!).\n\nFor the uninitiated, the Wells Fargo Center isn\u2019t just an arena\u2014it\u2019s a place where sound takes on a life of its own, where every note and every riff reverberates through your chest, a sentiment echoed by my significant other, who was delighted by the heavy bass tones from the opening act Coheed and Cambria.\n\nCoheed and Cambria: Outstanding and Should\u2019ve Had A Longer Set\n\nI must mention how much I enjoyed Coheed. From the moment the band began to play, the early crowd was electrified. If you\u2019re about to go to an Incubus concert and are unfamiliar with Coheed and Cambria before the show, witnessing them live will help you understand why they have such a devoted following. Especially Claudio.\n\nHis guitar work throughout the brief nine-song set was outstanding, with a memorable moment being when he lifted his guitar above his head during an extended and impressive solo, shredding without missing a beat.\n\nTheir opening set was fantastic, but it felt too short. I understand Incubus was the night\u2019s highlight, but nine songs seemed brief for such a talented band. We had such a good time witnessing Coheed that we both committed to seeing them at a headlining date the next time they come through Philadelphia.\n\nIncubus: Brandon Boyd Sounds as Great as Ever!\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Incubus and their stunning performance. On this night, they treated the audience to a performance of Morning View, an album many fans consider some of their best work.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about Brandon Boyd\u2019s voice on Reddit following his septum surgery a few years back. But I\u2019m here to say Brandon proved those detractors wrong. Not only did he sound flawless, but I will also say that Boyd\u2019s vocals were as solid and clear as ever, carrying the same power that made Incubus a staple of the early 2000s. He may be greyer than in his youth, but his voice is still timeless.\n\nVisually, Incubus put on a spectacular show. It was a mesmerizing blend of atmosphere, trippy visuals, and peaceful moments\u2014an experience that you have to witness to appreciate fully. Unlike Coheed and Cambria, who stuck to a straightforward (although tasteful) LED light show, Incubus took it to another level.\n\nThe stage came alive with psychedelic visuals, 3D imagery, lasers, and fog that seemed to reach out to the crowd. It was not just a concert visually but a whole sensory experience that evoked shades of Pink Floyd, albeit with today\u2019s technological advancements. At one point, the lasers felt so close that it seemed like they were right above my head! I\u2019ve seen lasers at a Linkin Park show before, but this was in a league of its own.\n\nMusically, Incubus stayed true to the original versions of Morning View, apart from a few songs converted to acoustic. It seems they opted for purity over reinterpretations found on Morning View 23. While I did love the reinterpretations found on MV23, this wasn\u2019t an issue for me.\n\nHowever, Incubus didn\u2019t solely rely on the nostalgia of fans excited to hear such a classic album. They also surprised the crowd with unexpected covers, seamlessly weaving in snippets of Phil Collins\u2019 \u201cIn The Air Tonight\u201d during \u201cAre You In?\u201d, Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella\u201d within \u201cUnder My Umbrella,\u201d Portishead\u2019s \u201cGlory Box\u201d during \u201cVitamin,\u201d and a full rendition of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cCome Together\u201d as a standalone cover. Brandon seemed to enjoy these moments, showcasing the band\u2019s versatility and deep respect for the music that influenced them.\n\nBut if we\u2019re focusing on great performances, let\u2019s give a moment to show love for the band\u2019s newest member, Nicole Rowe, who added a fresh dynamic to Incubus\u2019 sound the entire night. Her contributions as bassist and backing vocalist brought a new depth to Incubus\u2019 sound, and her gorgeous harmonies blended perfectly with Boyd\u2019s, uniquely layering his expressive voice. It\u2019s clear that Rowe is a natural fit for the band, and it will be exciting to see how her presence might shape future projects.\n\nFinally, one of the most impressive aspects of the night was Boyd\u2019s stamina. Instead of taking a short break before the encore, like many bands, Incubus powered straight through and delivered their final set with the same intensity as the rest of the show. I don\u2019t know where they get their energy, but it\u2019s admirable.\n\nIn a post-Covid world where ticket prices are higher than ever, Incubus made sure to give the fans an experience worth every penny. However, I was slightly disappointed that \u201cStellar,\u201d one of my favorite Incubus singles, didn\u2019t make the \u201chits\u201d portion of the setlist; the overall experience made up for it.\n\nAs someone who has been a fan of both bands for years but had never seen them live, I believe this concert was a perfect blend of technical brilliance, emotional resonance, and pure, unfiltered rock. I cannot wait to see both bands live again, and I am so grateful I got to experience this tour. What a night!",

Home prices were up nearly 5 percent year over year in November, according to CoreLogic, which is higher than the U.S. average rate of 3.4 percent.\n\nHome inventory improved alongside the slower sales pace, but housing supply remains constrained by high mortgage rates. Realtor.com shows active listings in the Las Vegas metro increased 42 percent over the past year as of December 2024 but are still 17 percent under prepandemic levels.\n\nWells Fargo said however that \u201cbuilders appear bullish\u201d on the Las Vegas metro and home building permits increased 23 percent year to date through November of last year, which was better than the 8 percent national uptick.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s report said a \u201cslowing labor market is the latest housing market headwind\u201d as Las Vegas employers have reduced headcounts for six consecutive months as of November 2024, coinciding with rising unemployment.\n\nHome prices near record highs\n\nSouthern Nevada home sales finished the year ahead of 2022 \u2014 which was the worst year for sales since 2008 \u2014 however sales are still down from prepandemic levels, and home prices are close to record highs again. The local industry also faces significant headwinds in a number of categories including a lack of land to develop as the Bureau of Land Management controls the vast majority of available land left in the valley and has been slow to release it, along with a slowdown in building due to heightened construction costs and labor shortages.\n\nMatt Hennessy, a Las Vegas-based mortgage advisor said elevated mortgage rates are a double-edged sword given the last jobs report which was stronger than expected.\n\n\u201cRates got nervous and spiked to their highest level in seven months. When the economy is doing really well, rates tend to rise because people expect the Fed to hold off on cutting rates,\u201d he said. \u201cInflation is like the price tag for everything we buy, and the Fed is laser-focused on getting it under control. Until then we probably won\u2019t see mortgage rates fall much. Most economists are predicting elevated rates for a lot longer.\u201d\n\nLas Vegas Re/Max Central broker and owner Lori Galarza said she thinks 2025 could actually be a good year for real estate in the valley given the country has gone through a healthy rate cut cycle and ushered in a new president who appears to be more business friendly. Galarza added local home prices are continuing to trend upwards which is in line with average historical data.\n\n\u201cThe trend every year in real estate is usually an increase of 4 percent (in home prices) played out over a 10-year average and the estimate is even over the 10-year average so I kind of think that\u2019s not too bad for Vegas, \u201cshe said. \u201cFrom November of last year to this year the median home price increased 6.7 percent, so we\u2019re obviously above the national average.\u201d\n\nContact Patrick Blennerhassett at pblennerhassett@reviewjournal.com.",

            "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced settlements with Wells Fargo Advisors and Merrill Lynch for failing to implement proper policies and procedures regarding their cash sweep programs. The two firms will collectively pay $60 million in penalties to resolve the charges.\n\nThe SEC found that both Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch offered bank deposit sweep programs (BDSPs) as the default option for most advisory clients. These programs directed uninvested cash from clients\u2019 advisory accounts into affiliated banks, which benefited the firms financially. During periods of rising interest rates, the gap between the yields offered by BDSPs and other cash sweep options increased significantly, at times reaching nearly 4%.\n\nWhat is a cash sweep program?\n\nA cash sweep program automatically transfers uninvested cash from a client\u2019s account into interest-earning options. These programs are a standard feature in brokerage and advisory accounts, helping ensure that idle cash generates a return while remaining easily accessible for future use.\n\nCash sweep options vary, with the most common being bank deposit sweep programs (BDSPs), where cash is moved into interest-earning accounts at partner or affiliated banks. Other options include investments in money market mutual funds or short-term government securities. The process is automatic, requiring no action from the client, and aims to make idle funds productive without sacrificing liquidity.\n\nWhile these programs offer convenience, they have drawn scrutiny for potential drawbacks. Yields on cash in sweep accounts, particularly in BDSPs, may be lower than those available through alternatives, especially during periods of rising interest rates. Financial institutions may also benefit financially from steering client cash into affiliated programs, creating potential conflicts of interest. Transparency is another concern, as clients may not always receive clear information about the available options and their potential returns.\n\nCash sweep programs remain a widely used feature, but the trade-offs in return and transparency have prompted regulators to keep a close watch on how firms handle these accounts.\n\n\u201cCash sweep programs impact nearly all advisory clients\u201d\n\nSanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said, \u201cCash sweep programs impact nearly all advisory clients, who often pay advisory fees on assets held in these accounts. These actions reinforce that advisory firms must have reasonably designed policies and procedures to consider their clients\u2019 best interest when evaluating potential sweep options for cash held in advisory accounts and to ensure that cash held in an advisory account is properly managed by financial advisers consistent with a client\u2019s investment profile.\u201d\n\nAccording to the SEC\u2019s orders, the firms failed to establish policies ensuring that clients\u2019 best interests were considered when selecting cash sweep options, particularly during periods of rising interest rates. Additionally, the firms did not adequately define the responsibilities of financial advisers in managing client cash within advisory accounts. These failures led to clients potentially missing out on better returns from alternative options.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the findings, Wells Fargo Clearing Services agreed to pay $28 million, Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network agreed to pay $7 million, and Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $25 million. The firms have also agreed to be censured and to cease and desist from future violations of the Advisers Act and its related rules.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation was conducted by teams from the Division of Enforcement\u2019s Asset Management Unit and Complex Financial Instruments Unit, with oversight from senior officials. The settlements underscore the SEC\u2019s focus on protecting advisory clients and ensuring that financial firms act in their clients\u2019 best interests when managing cash assets.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer\u2019s appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump\u2019s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent\u2019s confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \u201cliked it.\u201d He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there\u2019s the process respecters and the process undoers,\u201d Cramer thinks. He \u201cfelt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he\u2019s talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\u201d While during their exchange, Cramer thought \u201cSanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\u201d However, Bessent and Sanders actually \u201chad common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\u201d according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect\u2019s potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \u201cI agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I\u2019m not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it\u2019s kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I\u2019m trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn\u2019t jump out at me.\u201d\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \u201d We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we\u2019d say they\u2019re amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\u201d believes Cramer. China needs \u201cexports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don\u2019t wanna help anyone,\u201d according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \u201cPresident-elect Trump was elected,\u201d he shared. Cramer shared that this is \u201cbecause the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\u201d China\u2019s hostility leads Cramer to \u201cthink that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that\u2019s smart to try.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \u201cWell look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn\u2019t Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That\u2019s a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\u201d he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \u201cWell, I liked that even though everything we\u2019ve ever read all our lives says that they\u2019re inflationary.\u201d\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \u201cBessent\u2019s a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you\u2019re close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I\u2019ll bet Bessent. He\u2019s really exciting. He\u2019s an exciting intellect.\u201d In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \u201cmay know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\u201d\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\u201cHe was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone\u2019s hacking you, you\u2019re blocked, because they don\u2019t have the eye, like you know it\u2019s vision, or it\u2019s finger. And we don\u2019t do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it\u2019s very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don\u2019t. Which is crazy.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 72\n\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is one of the largest banks in the US in terms of domestic exposures. Like other mega-bank stocks, its shares have performed well over the past six months. They have gained 30% over this time period, with two notable drops coming in November and January when the shares soared by 13% and 6.7%. The former was due to President-elect Trump\u2019s election win while the latter came after Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)\u2019s Q4 saw investment banking income jump by 59% and guided net interest income growth ranging between 1% to 3% for 2025. Here is what Cramer said:\n\n\u201cLook I love Charlie Scharf [WFC CEO] and he\u2019s terrific. But, when it, Charlie\u2019s got a great national bank. But when it comes to capital markets, there was none better. It was really great. I mean I would like call him and congratulate. I mean I don\u2019t like to congratulate, but I\u2019d congratulate Charlie and I\u2019d congratulate David because I think that they are, they are really two of some of the greatest successes. I mean look at the price-to-earnings multiples of these Sarah. They\u2019re incredibly cheap. These are like thirteen, fourteen times earnings and they\u2019re just crushing it!\u201d\n\nOverall WFC ranks 6th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.

Two judges scored every round for the Russian-born Los Angeles fighter (50-45), and one judge had it 49-46. He is now 5-2 in his bare-knuckle fighting career. Brito, who hails from Maunabo, Puerto Rico, is now 6-6 under the BKFC banner. Brito entered fight night as the # 5 ranked contender in the BKFC welterweight division.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long time coming.

Based in Philadelphia, and headed by President and former professional boxer David Feldman, BKFC is dedicated to preserving the historical legacy of bare knuckle fighting, while utilizing a specifically created rule set that emphasizes fighter safety. BKFC holds all of its bouts in a revolutionary circular four-rope ring, designed to encourage fast-paced and exciting bouts. The patented BKFC \u201cSquared Circle\u201d contains scratch lines, based on the Broughton Rules which governed bare knuckle fighting in the 19th century, and which requires fighters to \u201cToe the Line\u201d: start every round face to face, and just inches apart.\n\nIn BKFC, only those fighters who are established professionals in boxing, MMA, kickboxing, or Muay Thai are allowed to compete. The referees and judges are required to have extensive professional combat sports experience. All fights are held under the auspices and control of an Athletic Commission. Unlike other fighting organizations and combat sports internationally which claim to be \u201cbare knuckle\u201d, but require wraps, tape, and gauze; BKFC is true to its word as fighters are not allowed to wrap their hands to within one inch of the knuckle. This makes BKFC unquestionably the truest form of bare knuckle fighting. BKFC is dedicated to not just creating the safest, most exciting, and highest-level bare-knuckle fighting organization in the world, it\u2019s also leading the way for a new fully recognized professional combat sport. BKFC is truly the sport of the future, which fully respects its remarkable past.",

            "content": "In a tight game with a dramatic ending, Villanova defeated Providence (9-10, 3-5 Big East), 75-73, at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nGraduate forward Eric Dixon led all scorers with 23 points. Dixon is now 10th on the program\u2019s all-time scoring list with 1,944 points, passing former Wildcat Josh Hart (1,921 points).\n\n\u201cEric Dixon is the best player in the country,\u201d Providence head coach Kim English said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a first-round draft pick. He\u2019s just the best player in college basketball right now.\u201d\n\nSenior guard Wooga Poplar also finished the game with a double-double, scoring 15 points and grabbing 13 rebounds. Poplar now has five double-doubles this season.\n\nThe \u2018Cats found more success from mid-range than the paint. The opening seven points for Villanova were all scored from mid-range or three-point range. Villanova went on to shoot 43% from the field goal range in the first half.\n\nFor the majority of the first half, Longino was the Wildcats\u2019 primary threat on offense. Dixon, who leads the nation in scoring, had a quiet first half but still managed to put up 11 points.\n\nThe Friars eventually got over their shooting slump from earlier in the half. After being down by nine, Providence tied the game at 23 with 3:53 left in the half. Come halftime, Providence would take its first lead of the game at 37-32.\n\nThe second half began with the Wildcats in possession. A layup from Brickus trimmed the Providence lead to 37-36.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half, senior forward Enoch Boakye converted on two free throws and gave the Wildcats a 38-37 lead.\n\nWhile it looked as if the Wildcats were starting to take control, the Friars started to gain back the momentum they had at the end of the first half.\n\n\u201c[Providence] made it really tough\u2026 those dudes are fighters over there,\u201d Villanova head coach Kyle Neptune said. \u201cI thought a couple of times we were going to extend our lead, and I thought we had it going, but they just kept coming back.\u201d\n\nThe Wells Fargo Center crowd brought the energy until the final buzzer. Villanova is 10-1 when playing at home.\n\n\u201cThe crowd was definitely into it,\u201d Brickus said. \u201cI feel like they brought great energy and I can\u2019t wait for us to be back [at the Wells Fargo Center].\u201d\n\nA tomahawk dunk by Poplar and a drive to the basket by Dixon further ignited the crowd, but baskets on the opposite quickly silenced it.\n\nDixon and Poplar both made key contributions on defense late in the game. Poplar\u2019s chase-down block with 3:30 on the clock sent Dixon flying into the stands to win back possession.\n\nBricks would then hit a crucial jumper with 2:15 left to give the Cats a five-point lead. The Friars would answer right back on a floater from redshirt junior guard Corey Floyd. This was followed by a game-tying three from redshirt sophomore guard Justyn Fernadez. Out of a Villanova timeout, Dixon\u2019s attempt from three was unsuccessful. But the ball fell right to sophomore guard Tyler Perkins, whose layup gave the \u2018Cats the lead with 42.7 to play.\n\n\u201cI call [Perkins] the battery,\u201d Neptune said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that brings a lot of energy and a lot of juice to our team. For our program, he always brings the energy in the locker room, in practice, in games, on the bench\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Friars were trailing Villanova, 75-73, and had possession of the ball with three seconds left. Graduate guard Jabri Abdur-Rahim missed Providence\u2019s final shot attempt that would lead to Villanova inbounding the ball right as the clock ran out.\n\n\u201cThis is the Big East,\u201d Neptune said. \u201c I always say it\u2026 from top to bottom this is the best league with high-level coaches. Every night you know it\u2019s going to be a game and this is no different. I\u2019m glad our guys pulled it out.\u201d\n\nVillanova\u2019s focus will now shift to Monday night when it will take on Georgetown (12-6, 3-4 Big East) at the Finneran Pavilion (6 p.m., FS1).",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 18 Stocks As Inflation Dropped. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed as inflation drops.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the show by commenting on the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. The CPI is an inflation measurement, and the data for December saw prices rise by 0.4% monthly and 2.9% yearly. The monthly figure was above economist expectations of 0.3% while the annual figure was in-line. Naturally, this would suggest positive market movement but the investor reaction was muted. Commenting on the reaction, Cramer shared: \u201cLook what can I say. People told me that, again and again, if it just came in in-line that would be bad. That turned out to be a great mis-judgement. An in-line number in an atmosphere where we felt that things are going to, that everything\u2019s going to go explode to the top and we\u2019re going to be seeing five percent on the ten-year and six percent on the thirty, all these crazy things. All of the table, at least for today.\u201d\n\nCramer added that market sentiment is at opposite ends when it comes to interest rates and earnings. This is because Investors don\u2019t expect the Fed to cut interest rates by much this year. According to him, \u201cWhen I look at this market. . . there was a tremendous amount of negativity about interest rates but positivity about earnings. If you take the negativity about interest rates off, you look at the earnings that we saw this morning, people are going to be pretty optimistic. And it might be sustainable throughout, I don\u2019t know, a little while. These are great numbers that we saw this morning.\u201d\n\nThe day had started with big banks releasing a set of earnings release that sent their stocks soaring. However, Cramer\u2019s co-host, David Faber, cautioned that when he previously appreciated positive bank earnings, the stocks ended up dipping in the aftermath. Cramer responded by agreeing with Faber\u2019s assessment and adding \u201cI think the difference might be that the tone of the comments at least from what I\u2019ve talked to the, from the CEOs, on the calls, will be a little more positive. For something that we, I think we all struggle to try to get a handle on which is this notion of animal spirits. [The] Notion of optimism.\u201d\n\nHe linked some of the optimism with the perception of the incoming administration being more friendly towards banks when it came to regulation. \u201cYou know, Carl, when you see CEOs, you try to figure out what\u2019s happening in the country since the election. And you hear people say listen it\u2019s a peaceful transition, you hear people say it\u2019s a much better environment for deals,\u201d Cramer commented. He added \u201cBut I come back and just say, what\u2019s really going on is a belief that it, when it comes to the banks, that there was some sort of tyrannical regime. . . If they are gone, then maybe there is a runway for more than just one quarter\u2019s growth.\u201d",

The tricky part is figuring out how long to hold on before a dreaded correction occurs. Fortunately for you, investment guru Jim Cramer just shed light on two high-performing stocks from 2024 that he believes will continue being winners in 2025. Keep reading to find out what they are.\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)\n\nFrom its humble beginnings in the stagecoach era of the Old West, this bank has grown into one of the world's premier financial institutions. The Federal Reserve regards Wells Fargo as \"too big to fail.\" That speaks volumes about the bank's size and reach, but it has also earned the bank additional scrutiny from regulators.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDespite being a profitable bank, Wells Fargo has been constrained by a $1.95 trillion \"asset cap\" since 2018. The asset cap was put in place by the Federal Reserve as punishment for a high-profile scandal that involved Wells Fargo employees creating fake accounts for existing customers to generate additional fees. However, a recent article in Reuters indicates that the Federal Reserve may lift that ban in 2025.\n\nJim Cramer has also heard the same thing and believes there is validity to the rumor. When the subject of Wells Fargo came up at a recent meeting of his investor's club, Cramer said, \"The idea that this foolishness by regulators can continue in 2025 is pretty unfathomable. While Wells Fargo has done a lot despite a cap on its activities, it's inconceivable that lifting the restriction won't matter to the stock.\"\n\nIt's also likely that the incoming Trump Administration will take a more \"hands-off\" regulatory approach than the outgoing Biden Administration. That also plays into Wells Fargo's favor. Now might be the right time to buy some shares and don't forget this stock has passive income potential. Benzinga's estimates and public filings show Wells is paying a solid 2.24% dividend on its $71.57 share price.",

Zelle\u2019s operator, \u201cEarly Warning Services,\u201d was also named.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the peer-to-peer payment service was \u201crushed\u201d onto the market to compete with other payment apps like Venmo and Cash App.\n\nHowever, the suit alleged Zelle failed to implement \u201ceffective consumer safeguards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\u201d CFPB Director Rohit Chopra explained in the announcement. \u201cBy their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly Warning Services was responsible for the design and operation of Zelle. It is co-owned by Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo.\n\nEarly warnings about Zelle fraud all over TikTok\n\nGilgra2025 urged viewers who previously used Zelle to head over to the CFPB website and file a complaint.\n\nThe TikToker explained that the app did not properly warn people that money sent to the wrong receiver couldn\u2019t be recouped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey did not give us the correct warning,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not let us know.\u201d\n\nHe hopes the lawsuit will result in customers receiving financial restitution.\n\nThe Daily Dot covered many previous reports of consumers losing money to Zelle fraud.\n\nOne fraud analyst went viral after warning others to avoid sending money to people they do not know with the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cZelle is treated like a cash transaction. It is treated like once you gave the cash to someone, that\u2019s it; it\u2019s gone,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe as banks don\u2019t have recovery rights for that, and it literally says on Zelle\u2019s website [that] Zelle\u2019s intention was for friends and family.\u201d\n\nAnother user went viral after mistakenly receiving a $700 random Zelle payment and refusing to return it. The customer believed he might have been the target of a Zelle scam.\n\nThe fears are well-founded.\n\nAccording to the CFPB, Zelle customers reported losses exceeding $870 million at just three banks over a seven-year period since the app\u2019s launch in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Bank of America stands behind Zelle\u2019s service\n\nAfter the lawsuit was announced, the bank issued a statement that read:\n\n\u201cMore than 99.95 percent of transactions across the Zelle network go through without incident. When a client has an issue, we work directly with them. We strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s effort to impose huge new costs on the 2,200 banks and credit unions that offer the free Zelle service to clients. 23 million Bank of America clients have embraced Zelle, regularly using it to send money to friends, family and people they trust.\u201d\n\nViewers had mixed reactions to the lawsuit\n\nMixed responses to the news flooded the video\u2019s comments section.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome reported their own issues using the app.\n\n\u201cI lost 1K to a wrong person,\u201d user STORMI THE commented.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an issue, sent $400 and they said they didn\u2019t own Zelle so my bank could do nothing. This was years ago at the start of it,\u201d user Teenie Earth Angel said.\n\nHowever, many defended the app and hoped it would not be discontinued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIma be mad when my banks stop offering Zelle bc y\u2019all don\u2019t know you should make sure u know who ur sending money to w/o getting a warning,\u201d user Melinda Estrada wrote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been usuing zelle since it came out and it always had that pop up are you sure this person is registered as this,\u201d user Sierra commented.\n\nOthers echoed the position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve used Zelle since it started and i have WF and that disclaimer \u2018warning\u2019 has always been provided. The issue is that people don\u2019t read the info provided,\u201d user DMunoz wrote.\n\n\n\nThe Daily Dot reached out to JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Zelle, and TikTok user gilgra2025 by email for comment.\n\n\n\nInternet culture is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Now that the Comptroller\u2019s in-house process is finished, this case finally will be heard by judges who don\u2019t work for the agency,\u201d Morgan wrote. \u201cWe look forward to presenting Mr. McLinko\u2019s case to the court of appeal, and we remain confident that he will prevail.\u201d\n\nMcLinko\u2019s penalties Tuesday came alongside similar measures against Wells\u2019 former community bank group risk officer, Claudia Russ Anderson, and former chief auditor, David Julian. They received $10 million and $7 million penalties, respectively.\n\nThe penalties are the last from the OCC against the 11 executives linked to Wells\u2019 fake-accounts scandal. Prior to Tuesday, the agency\u2019s penalties in the case totaled $43.1 million, including a $17.5 million fine and a banking ban for ex-Wells CEO John Stumpf and a $17 million fine against the bank\u2019s former retail banking chief Carrie Tolstedt. Tolstedt pleaded guilty in 2023 to obstructing a bank examination but avoided prison time, agreeing instead to a lifetime ban from working in banking.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment Tuesday but directed Banking Dive to a 2020 statement by CEO Charlie Scharf.\n\n\u201cThe OCC\u2019s actions are consistent with my belief that we should hold ourselves and individuals accountable,\u201d Scharf said at the time. \u201cThey also are consistent with our belief that significant parts of the operating model of our Community Bank were flawed.\n\n\u201cThis was inexcusable. Our customers and you all deserved more from the leadership of this Company,\u201d he said.\n\nThe OCC did not respond to a request for comment.",

The firms have agreed to pay civil penalties of $60 million to settle the charges.\n\nThe charges against Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network claim that the firms failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures related to its bank deposit sweep program. The regulator says from at least 2019 through May 2024, the Wells Fargo entities offered the program as the only cash sweep option for most advisory clients and received significant financial benefits.\n\nThe firms set the interest rates offered in the programs, and at times, the yield differential between their bank deposit sweep program and other alternatives was nearly 4% higher.\n\nThe charges against Merrill Lynch were similar. The SEC claims the three firms\u2019 policies and procedures did not consider clients\u2019 best interests when evaluating and selecting cash sweep options. They also failed to consider the duties of financial advisors in managing client cash in advisory accounts.\n\n\u201cCash sweep programs impact nearly all advisory clients, who often pay advisory fees on assets held in these accounts,\u201d said Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, in a statement. \u201cThese actions reinforce that advisory firms must have reasonably designed policies and procedures to consider their clients\u2019 best interest when evaluating potential sweep options for cash held in advisory accounts and to ensure that cash held in an advisory account is properly managed by financial advisers consistent with a client\u2019s investment profile.\u201d\n\nRelated:Wirehouses Face a Fresh Round of Cash Sweep Class Actions\n\nAccording to the SEC order, Wells Fargo has already improved its policies and procedures for selecting cash sweep options.\n\n\u201cOur agreement with the SEC puts this broader industry matter behind us, and as the settlement states, we have already successfully addressed the issues covered by the resolution,\u201d said Beth Richek, spokeswoman for Wells Fargo.\n\nThe SEC also noted remedial acts taken by Merrill Lynch. The firm increased the rates paid to advisory clients and enhanced its supervisory procedures targeted at a subset of investment advisor program accounts with significant cash holdings. The firm also lowered the minimum thresholds for investing cash in certain money market funds. It also provided detailed narrative responses to the SEC to speed up its investigation.\n\nRelated:Raymond James Facing Two Lawsuits Over Cash Sweep Program\n\n\"Merrill took several significant steps before becoming aware of the Commission\u2019s investigation, including increasing the rates paid to advisory clients in Merrill\u2019s Bank Deposit Program, lowering the minimum thresholds for investing cash in certain money market funds, and adopting and implementing enhanced supervisory procedures,\" said Naomi R. Patton, a spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch. \"In fact, Merrill was one of the first large firms to offer a significantly higher cash sweep rate for advisory clients\u2019 uninvested cash.\"\n\nThe firms did not admit or deny the SEC\u2019s findings but agreed to a censure and cease and desist from violating the charged provisions. Wells Fargo Clearing Services agreed to pay $28 million in civil penalties, Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network will pay $7 million, and Merrill Lynch will pay $25 million.\n\nMany large institutions have cash sweep programs that automatically transfer (or sweep) the remaining cash balances in the client\u2019s eligible cash (including proceeds of securities transactions, cash deposits and other money) into \u201cinterest-bearing deposit accounts.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has been investigating these programs at several big firms. In August, Wells Fargo disclosed that it was in \u201cresolution discussions with the SEC\u201d on the cash sweep issue. The firm revealed in the second quarter it would increase the interest rates in its cash sweep programs, reducing the firm\u2019s revenue by approximately $350 million per year.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch had also disclosed in SEC filings last year they could face legal and regulatory risks due to their cash sweep programs.\n\nSeveral of the big firms, including Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, Merrill, UBS, Ameriprise and LPL are facing class action lawsuits related to their cash sweep programs.",

            "content": "Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch agreed Friday to pay $60 million in total to settle SEC allegations that they didn't do enough to consider clients' best interests when placing their money in \"cash sweeps\" accounts.\n\nThe announcement came as the first major fine imposed since regulators and plaintiffs' lawyers started scrutinizing over a year ago how large firms handle clients' uninvested cash.\n\nSo-called sweeps accounts have been under a microscope lately following widespread allegations that wealth managers use them to pad their bottom lines rather than benefit clients. Cash sweeps refer to firms' practice of taking uninvested cash that investors hold in brokerage and advisory accounts and moving it over to affiliated or unaffiliated banks, where it can be lent out or invested.\n\nA spate of recent lawsuits accuse wealth managers of sharing too little of the resulting returns with clients. The suits also fault firms for not directing clients' money into better-paying investments such as money market funds, Treasury bonds and certificates of deposit. The Securities and Exchange Commission's settlement said both Merrill and Wells Fargo had \"cash alternative\" products that sometimes paid at least 4 percentage points more than sweeps accounts.\n\nThe SEC specifically accused the firms of failing to have written policies and procedures requiring advisors to consider if their sweeps policies were really in clients' best interests, or if other options might be better. Instead, according to regulators, Merrill and Wells Fargo reaped substantial financial benefits by automatically \"sweeping\" billions of dollars in client assets.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nLPL, Morgan Stanley responding to regulators' new sweeps inquiries\n\nUBS joins Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo in raising sweeps rates\n\nUnlike its competitors, RBC has no plans to change 'sweeps' rates\n\nFollowing Wells, Morgan Stanley plans changes to sweeps policies\n\n'Sweeps' suits pile up with new complaints against Wells Fargo, LPL\n\n\"These actions reinforce that advisory firms must have reasonably designed policies and procedures to consider their clients' best interest when evaluating potential sweep options for cash held in advisory accounts and to ensure that cash held in an advisory account is properly managed by financial advisers consistent with a client's investment profile,\" Sanjay Wadhwa, the acting director of the SEC's division of enforcement, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nSweeps lagged far behind rising interest rates\n\nThe scrutiny over cash sweeps reached a fever pitch last year after the Federal Reserve finished hiking its key benchmark rate 11 times to a range of 5.25% to 5.5% in a bid to tame inflation. Rates have since come down , likely making the difference between rates paid on sweeps accounts and other types of cash alternatives less glaring. But while they were on the way up, many firms weren't necessarily making sure their sweeps rates were keeping pace, critics say.\n\nOf the $60 million in total fines announced Friday, Merrill owes $25 million, and two Wells' subsidiaries \u2014 Wells Fargo Clearing Services and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network \u2014 owe $35 million. Neither firm admitted to nor denied the SEC's charges.\n\nSpokespeople for both Merrill and Wells Fargo pointed to recent changes their firms have made to their sweeps policies.\n\n\"As the SEC noted, Merrill took several significant steps before becoming aware of the Commission's investigation, including increasing the rates paid to advisory clients in Merrill's Bank Deposit Program, lowering the minimum thresholds for investing cash in certain money market funds, and adopting and implementing enhanced supervisory procedures,\" the Merrill spokesperson said. \"In fact, Merrill was one of the first large firms to offer a significantly higher cash sweep rate for advisory clients' uninvested cash.\"\n\nThe Wells spokesperson said, \"Our agreement with the SEC puts this broader industry matter behind us, and as the settlement states, we have already successfully addressed the issues covered by the resolution.\"\n\n\n\nMerrill and Wells Fargo made sweeps changes\n\nWells Fargo and Merrill's parent firm, Bank of America \u2014 along with their industry rival Morgan Stanley \u2014 have both disclosed in regulatory filings that they were responding to SEC inquiries about their sweeps policies. Wells and Bank of America have also discussed planned sweeps changes in recent earnings calls.\n\nTalking about Wells Fargo's second quarter results in July, Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo said the firm was planning to raise the sweeps rates paid on certain advisory accounts and predicted the change would lower its net interest income by $350 million for the year. Wells reported Wednesday that its net interest income was down by $50 million in the fourth quarter as a result of \"higher deposit costs including the impact of increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts, partially offset by higher deposit balances.\"\n\nBank of America meanwhile announced in its own earnings call in July that it had made pricing changes on certain deposits held at Merrill.\n\nThe SEC's settlement with Wells Fargo and Merrill credited the firms for making improvements to their cash sweeps rates and for cooperating in its investigation. The SEC looked at Merrill's sweeps policies from January 2022 to April 2024 and Wells Fargo's from 2019 to May 2024.\n\nSince then, the SEC said, Merrill has \"increased the rates paid to advisory clients\" and \"lowered the minimum thresholds for investing cash in certain money market funds.\" Wells similarly has \"made improvements to its policies and procedures regarding the selection of cash sweep options for advisory clients and the allocation of client cash in advisory accounts,\" along with other remedial steps.\n\n\n\nSweeps suits pile up\n\nMerrill and Wells Fargo are among a long list of firms that have been hit with lawsuits over their sweeps policies in the past year. In general, the suits \u2014 also lobbed at Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan , Ameriprise , UBS , LPL Financial , Raymond James , Charles Schwab and others \u2014 accuse wealth managers of violating their fiduciary duty to serve clients' best interests.\n\nOne of the lead attorneys in many of the suits, Alan Rosca of the Beachwood, Ohio-based firm Rosca Scarlato, said he was somewhat surprised to see the SEC's settlement with Merrill and Wells Fargo invoked neither fiduciary duties nor the companion Regulation Best Interest conduct rule for broker-dealers. Just as significant, though, was the SEC's decision to accuse the firms of violating provisions of the federal Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n\nThat, to Rosca, clearly shows the SEC thinks uninvested cash triggers wealth managers' obligation to serve their clients.\n\n\"The SEC is saying that is part of your advisory business because clients have options and you are giving them only one option,\" Rosca said. \"You could put them into a money market fund but you are instead putting them into a self-serving product.\"\n\nSEC settlements don't provide binding precedents for court cases, and Rosca declined to say what he thought the deal with Merrill and Wells Fargo will mean for his lawsuits.\n\n\n\nThe nitty gritty on sweeps at Merrill, Wells Fargo\n\nIn seeking to justify their policies, large wealth managers often argue that cash sweeps are meant to give clients a safe place to temporarily park their money while they decide how they want to invest it. Many note that sweeps accounts offer protection by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which guarantees up to $250,000 held in individual bank accounts. Money markets, by contrast, aren't covered by the FDIC.\n\nThe SEC's settlement with Wells Fargo says the firm, during the period under scrutiny, had only one sweeps account option for its clients. Money in those accounts was moved over to Wells Fargo Bank and other banks.\n\nThe SEC said Wells charges clients fees for managing money in sweeps accounts while also setting the rates paid on those holdings. Wells separately had money market funds, Treasury bond offerings and certificates of deposit that at times were paying as much as 5 percentage points more.\n\nThe SEC said Wells not only benefited from that difference in yields; its brokerage arm also received payments from Wells Fargo Bank and other banks for sending assets to them.\n\nThe agency also noted that Wells placed a limit on the amount of uninvested cash clients could hold in certain advisory accounts. But the upper threshold was set at 25% of their assets, a policy regulators deemed not \"reasonably designed to monitor or regularly evaluate whether client cash was appropriately allocated on a timely basis according to a client's goals and objectives.\"\n\nThe SEC said the limit was lowered to 5% in October 2023 and then raised again to 25% last year after Wells started paying more on sweeps accounts. The SEC said Wells did discuss the workings of its sweeps policies in regulatory filings. But the disclosures were inconsistent, according to the SEC, and stated the firm had no \"duty to monitor the Cash Sweep Vehicle for your account, or make recommendations about, or make changes to, the Cash Sweep Program that may be beneficial to you.\"\n\nRegulators lobbed similar allegations at Merrill. Merrill, according to the SEC, likewise offered only one type of sweeps account and moved cash out of it into affiliated banks. Merrill too could have offered various money market funds, Treasury investments, certificates of deposit and other cash alternatives sometimes yielding as much as 4 percentage points more.\n\nThe SEC said Merrill also disclosed the workings of its sweeps policies in regulatory filings.\n\n\"Merrill Lynch earned advisory fees on [sweeps] assets and was credited with revenue from affiliated banking entities based in part on the spread earned by banking affiliates on the [sweeps] Program,\" according to the SEC. \"Merrill Lynch's banking affiliates earned significant net interest income on the [sweeps] Program deposits during the Relevant Period.\"",

This offer is available in-branch only and gives a $525 bonus when depositing $25,000 and then maintaining that balance for 61 days. This is obviously a significant deposit requirement for many and there is some loss of interest on those funds while they are deposited in the savings account (more details below). That said, it could be an appealing option for those who can swing it.\n\nThe Deal\n\nWells Fargo is offering a $525 bonus when opening a new savings account, depositing $25,000 and maintaining that balance for a minimum of 61 days.\n\nDirect Link to Offer\n\nIn order to receive the bonus you must:\n\nGo to this link and enter an e-mail address to receive a promo code. Open a new Way2Save savings account with a minimum balance of $25 in-branch using the promo code by 2/25/25. Deposit at least $25,000 by day 30 after account opening and maintain that balance until 90 days after account opening.\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nThis offer is for new savings customers only. All Wells Fargo consumer savings accounts are eligible for this offer with the exception of Time Accounts (CDs) and savings accounts offered by Wells Fargo Private Bank.\n\nYou must use your bonus offer code at account opening when you apply for a new eligible Wells Fargo savings account\n\nYou are not eligible for this offer if: You are a current owner of a Wells Fargo consumer savings account You have received any other consumer savings offer bonus or promotional rate that required a bonus offer code within the past 12 months. You are a Wells Fargo employee\n\nTo receive the bonus, you must: Open a new Wells Fargo consumer savings account with a minimum opening deposit of $25 in a Wells Fargo branch by February 25, 2025. All account applications are subject to approval. Bring $25,000 or more in new money to your new savings account by Day 30 and maintain at least a $25,000 balance through Day 90 after account opening. New money is money that is new to the customer or new to Wells Fargo (deposited into the customer\u2019s new savings account directly from outside of Wells Fargo and Company and all affiliates, or from a Wells Fargo account not owned by the customer).\n\nThe Wells Fargo Way2Save\u00ae Savings account monthly service fee is $5. Minimum opening deposit is $25. The monthly service fee can be avoided with one of the following each fee period: $300 minimum daily balance 1 automatic transfer each fee period of $25 or more from a linked Wells Fargo checking account 1 automatic transfer each business day within the fee period of $1 or more from a linked Wells Fargo checking account 1 or more Save As You Go\u00ae transfers from a linked Wells Fargo checking account. A qualifying Save As You Go transfer is an automatic transfer of $1 from your linked Wells Fargo checking account to your Way2Save Savings account each time you (or any authorized signer or joint owner) use your debit card for a one-time purchase or complete a Bill Pay transaction through online banking, and the one-time debit card purchase or Bill Pay transaction posts to the account. We reserve the right to determine through our sole discretion if a particular transaction is a qualifying transaction. Primary account owner is 24 years old or under. (When the primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee.) Customers 12 and under must have an adult co-owner.\n\n\n\nQuick Thoughts\n\nBased on the terms, you only have to leave the $25K in the bank for ~61 days to get the bonus. This is because you have to deposit $25 initially and then add the remainder of the $25,000 by 30 days from account opening. Then, you only have to maintain that balance for 90 days after account opening.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the net upside is much lower than $525. There are plenty of ways to get ~4-5% interest right now with savings accounts, CDs and T-bills. These savings accounts offer a paltry 0.01 \u2013 0.15%, so you\u2019re effectively losing 61 days of interest on $25,000. Given that, the opportunity cost is ~$200 in interest, making the incremental gain closer to $325 than $525.\n\nThat said, this bonus corresponds to a ~12% annual interest rate, a very good return. At the same time, there\u2019s minimum time commitment and more flexibility with your money.\n\nWe would normally jump at this kind of return were it not for the largesse of the last couple of years, as well as current interest rates. While it doesn\u2019t seem quite as earth-shattering now, I\u2019d probably still take the plunge on this if my cash flow allowed, simply because it\u2019s fairly easy and the funds are tied up for a relatively short amount of time when compared to many other bank bonuses or CD\u2019s.",

That\u2019s a downgrade from the banking industry ban the administrative law judge recommended in 2022.\n\nPaul McLinko, Wells Fargo\u2019s former executive audit director, received a $1.5 million fine from the OCC on Tuesday, along with a cease-and-desist order, on the same grounds as Julian. The OCC also cited McLinko\u2019s failure \u201cto maintain professional independence from the Community Bank.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s penalties are the last from the OCC against a swath of 11 executives linked to Wells\u2019 fake-accounts scandal. The agency\u2019s other penalties in the case totaled more than $43.1 million, including a $17.5 million fine and a banking ban for ex-Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf and a $17 million fine against Carrie Tolstedt, who served as Wells\u2019 retail banking chief at the time of the scandal. Tolstedt pleaded guilty in 2023 to one count of obstructing a bank examination and ultimately avoided prison time but agreed to a lifetime ban from working in the banking industry.\n\nThe OCC charged Russ Anderson, Julian and McLinko in January 2020, along with other executives, but the three opted not to settle. Lawyers for the three did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment but directed attention to a 2020 statement CEO Charlie Scharf \u2013 then three months into his tenure at the bank \u2013 made on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe OCC\u2019s actions are consistent with my belief that we should hold ourselves and individuals accountable,\u201d Scharf said at the time. \u201cThey also are consistent with our belief that significant parts of the operating model of our Community Bank were flawed.\n\n\u201cThis was inexcusable. Our customers and you all deserved more from the leadership of this Company,\u201d he said.",

            "content": "It\u2019s been a banner earnings season for U.S. banks.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 financial results were no different, with the lender posting strong guidance and better earnings than were expected by Wall Street.\n\nBut, as the bank\u2019s leadership stressed on the Wednesday (Jan. 15) investor call, the quarter was a pivotal one for a different reason than just financials: it marked a significant turning point in the bank\u2019s commitment to risk management and compliance.\n\n\u201cBuilding the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work,\u201d CEO Charlie Scharf told investors.\n\nIn September, Wells Fargo signed a formal agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to rectify deficiencies in the bank\u2019s anti-money laundering (AML) and financial crimes risk management practices.\n\n\u201cEarly last year, the OCC terminated a consent order it issued in 2016 regarding sales practices. The closure of this order was an important milestone and is a confirmation that we operate much differently today,\u201d Scharf said, noting that it was the \u201csixth consent order terminated by our regulators since I joined Wells Fargo.\u201d\n\nWith those six regulatory consent orders resolved since 2019, Wells Fargo is looking to make it clear that enhancing its risk management and compliance infrastructure remains the cornerstone of its operational strategy. This is vital as the company seeks to strengthen its governance and ensure adherence to regulatory standards.\n\nHowever, the company acknowledged it is not yet done with its regulatory work, emphasizing that embedding a robust operational risk culture is still a work in progress.\n\nRead more: Wells Fargo CEO More Confident in Bank\u2019s Compliance Controls\n\nRisk Management and Regulatory Compliance as Priorities\n\nWells Fargo continues to channel significant resources into compliance. These investments are essential to achieving long-term regulatory goals while also positioning the company for sustainable growth.\n\n\u201cThere are three primary areas where we expect to invest: incremental technology expense, including investments in infrastructure and business capabilities; other investments; and expected merit increases in performance-based discretionary compensation,\u201d executives said.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not done, I\u2019m confident that we will successfully complete the work required in our consent orders and embed an operational risk and compliance mindset into our culture,\u201d said Scharf.\n\nThe company said it has been deliberate about rebuilding its internal culture to align with a more compliance-oriented mindset. This includes revamping its incentive structures to avoid past missteps, particularly in branch operations.\n\nBeyond regulatory compliance, Wells Fargo identified cybersecurity as a critical area of risk management. The company emphasized the growing complexity of cyber threats and the importance of being prepared to address them.\n\n\u201cThe biggest risk that we have that we spend the most time talking about is cyber at this point \u2026 which is why we spend so much time on that and have the level of investment that we have and put the resources into it,\u201d said Scharf.\n\nThis shift underscores a broader lesson: compliance and risk management are not at odds with growth. Instead, aligning incentives with a culture of integrity can catalyze both.\n\nSee also: Compliance Moved From Cost Center to Growth Engine in 2024\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nFor the full year 2024, the bank noted that over 2.4 million new credit card accounts were opened, contributing to strong spend growth (up $17 billion year over year). Net loan charge-offs were stable year-over-year but increased by 4 basis points compared to Q3 2024, reflecting higher losses in the credit card portfolio.\n\nThe company saw significant progress in earnings, supported by strong fee-based revenue growth (up 15%), which offset declines in net interest income (NII). Still, NII grew by $146 million (1%) from Q3 2024, marking the first sequential increase since Q4 2022. This was driven by higher customer deposit balances, which reduced reliance on higher-cost funding sources.\n\nAverage deposits increased compared to both Q3 2024 and Q4 2023, reflecting stabilization in migration trends to higher-yielding products and a reduction in corporate treasury CDs.\n\nNon-interest expenses declined by 12% year-over-year, driven by lower FDIC special assessments and severance costs, as well as ongoing efficiency initiatives.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock was up around 7% as of reporting on the news of its results.",

            "content": "The Knicks visited Philadelphia for the first time this season back on Nov. 12. It was Joel Embiid\u2019s season debut. Both teams were under .500 at the time of the game. Granted, New York entered at 4-5 while the Sixers were 2-7, but the slow starts could be more understood in mid-November. New York was working Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns into its lineup. Embiid was debuting in 2024-25 for Philly, Paul George was still getting used to his new team and the Sixers were without Tyrese Maxey who missed a couple weeks in November with a hamstring injury.\n\nIt\u2019s important to think about how much time has passed since New York\u2019s first trip down the Jersey Turnpike and across the bridge. It might only be just two months, but for Sixers fans, it\u2019s been a long and painful two months. New York won that game in November and the Sixers fell to 2-8. If I told you after that game that in two months, the Sixers would be further away from .500 than they were after the final buzzer sounded, I highly doubt you would have believed me. But here we are. The Sixers are 15-23 and will hit the official halfway point of their 2024-25 campaign on Sunday night in Milwaukee.\n\nThey\u2019re singing a rather different tune in the Big Apple. The win in the middle of November got New York to .500, and the Knicks have only been below .500 one time since then. At 26-15, New York is within striking distance of the defending champion Celtics for the Eastern Conference\u2019s No. 2 seed. The Knicks are just three games south of Boston in the standings. With a good second half, New York might be able to move past the Celtics which would give the Knicks home court advantage in a potential second round playoff series between the two Atlantic division foes.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the Sixers in the exact position the Knicks are in countless times now and the Sixers have gone on to win 50-55 games, only to lose in the second round. None of this is meant to imply that the Knicks are suddenly a franchise worth emulating. After all, their drought without appearing in the Eastern Conference Finals is somehow longer than that of the Sixers. But the contrasting directions the two franchises have gone in since the middle of November should serve as a reminder for what many already knew. There are going to be a lot of Knicks fans at Wells Fargo Center yet again on Wednesday night.\n\nIf you can even muster up the energy to get mad about this now, you have more prideful bones in your body than I do. Perhaps it\u2019s a good thing that this game, New York\u2019s final one in Philadelphia in the regular season, falls during the week of an Eagles playoff game. If this game was after the Eagles season ended, I\u2019m sure the number of Knicks fans at Wells Fargo Center would be a topic local sports radio shows had no choice but to address.\n\nThe reality is that the Sixers have made their own bed here and now they must sleep in it. This season has been nothing short of a disaster so why should anyone care if the building gets taken over by Knicks fans on Wednesday night? Truthfully, there was already probably some atrophy that Sixers fans were feeling as last season progressed that led to the Knicks fans coming in the playoff series. The writing was on the wall for another early playoff exit with the Sixers ending up in the play-in tournament and now the team might not even meet that low bar.\n\nHowever far the Knicks go in the playoffs, it\u2019s fair to assume they\u2019re going to have the attention of most New York sports fans for the remainder of the season. They\u2019ve probably already had most of the attention in the market given how bad both football teams were in New York yet again this season. Once the Eagles season ends, many Philadelphia sports fans are going to just start counting down the days until pitchers and catchers report to Clearwater for another Phillies season. So, get ready for more blue and orange at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday night. It will serve as yet another reminder of just how bleak the 2024-25 season has gotten for the Philadelphia 76ers.",

Anderson also failed to escalate known risks, downplaying the severity of the sales practices and provided false, incomplete, and misleading information to the OCC in its 2015 examinations, the regulator said.\n\nThe bank's former Chief Auditor David Julian \u2014 who, according to his Linkedin profile, is now retired \u2014 was fined $7 million, ordered to cease-and-desist from unsafe practices and comply with all laws and regulations. Paul Mclinko, the banks' former executive audit director, was fined $1.5 million and also received a cease-and-desist order compelling him to cease unsafe practices and comply with regulatory obligations in any banking activity going forward.\n\nThe two former senior auditors at Wells Fargo were found to have committed serious misconduct related to the bank's sales practices and from 2013 to 2016, having failed to plan and manage audits effectively to detect and address fraudulent sales practices, including the opening of unauthorized accounts and falsifying customer information. They also failed to escalate the issue of sales practices misconduct to higher authorities, disregarding the risks to the bank and its customers, according to the OCC.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokeperson declined to comment for the story, but pointed to the bank's press release issued in 2020 when the OCC opened the action against the executives.\n\nThe OCC brought charges against Wells executives in 2020, and in 2023 resolved charges filed against eight other former senior bank executives, resulting in civil money penalties totaling $43,175,000. Among these, Carrie Tolstedt \u2014 the former head of retail banking at Wells Fargo \u2014 paid a $17 million fine and had $67 million in compensation clawed back by the bank.\n\nThe OCC said the bank's business model used unreasonable sales goals and sales pressure to make higher profits than would have been possible without such practices. The bank also issued a high number of unauthorized products and services to customers to inflate the number of sales per household and raise the company's stock price.",

Broad Street.\n\nThe Sixers currently share the Wells Fargo Center with the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Center is also the home arena for the National Lacrosse League's Philadelphia Wings and serves as an alternate site for Villanova Wildcats basketball games.\n\nThe arena is part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, which includes Citizens Bank Park, where the Phillies play, and Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Eagles.\n\nWells Fargo Center opened in 1996; World Cup of Hockey first event\n\nMore than 19,000 fans packed the Wells Fargo Center on August 31, 1996 to see Team USA vs. Team Canada in the World Cup of Hockey.\n\nThe Sixers' first game at the then-CoreStates Center was on October 18, 1996.\n\nDuring its 29-year history, the Wells Fargo Center has hosted the Republican National Convention; NCAA Final Four tournaments; X-Games competitions; U.S. Gymnastic Championships; and several record-breaking concerts by Madonna, Billy Joel, Elton John and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe arena won\u2019t be called Wells Fargo Center much longer; the banking giant\u2019s naming-rights deal with Comcast Spectacor ends in August.\n\nWhy aren't Sixers moving to Center City?\n\nAfter years of planning and buying adjacent lands along with several rounds of talks with Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, Philadelphia City Council and stakeholders throughout the city, the Sixers' ownership group decided to drop that Center City project to stay in South Philadelphia.\n\nPublished reports indicate the Sixers' decided to not pursue Center City and remain in South Philadelphia due to pressure from the NBA and National Football League, along with the promise of a new Sixers arena to be built inside the complex at some point in the future.\n\nDamon C.

            "content": "In a stunning turn of events, the Philadelphia 76ers will remain at the sports complex in South Philadelphia instead of building a new basketball arena in Center City, according to multiple City Hall sources.\n\nThe decision is rooted in a deal struck with Comcast Spectacor, and comes more than two years after the team proposed the new arena. The NBA and the NFL helped broker the agreement, which ended the franchise\u2019s second attempt to procure a home of its own.\n\nOver the next decade, Comcast hopes to transform the sports complex into a year-round destination for work and play. The $2.5 billion proposal calls for new retail and restaurants, a music venue and a hotel.\n\nWhen the master plan was announced in February, it did not specifically call for a new arena but did leave room for one. On Sunday, a labor leader said Comcast, which owns the Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center, had agreed to build a new \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d facility in the stadium district.\n\nA Comcast spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMayor Cherelle Parker, who strongly supported the arena project, is expected to hold a news conference at 11 a.m. Monday. Greenlighting the arena was a defining moment of her first year in office.\n\nIn December, City Council passed legislation authorizing the $1.3 billion arena. The 12-5 vote ended a contentious legislative process featuring hours of public testimony, intense closed-door negotiations and the forcible removal of several arena opponents from council chambers.\n\nWith the approvals in hand, the Sixers planned to build a privately funded arena atop SEPTA\u2019s Jefferson Station at 10th and Market streets. The 18,500-seat facility would have replaced a third of the Fashion District mall.\n\nThe team argued the arena would help revitalize Market East, a disjointed stretch of retail, government buildings and tourist attractions that has struggled to thrive for decades despite millions in investment. The decision to remain in South Philly comes days after Macy\u2019s announced it was closing 66 stores across the country, including the company\u2019s iconic store at 13th and Market streets.

The team\u2019s lease at Wells Fargo Center, which is owned by Comcast Spectator, runs until 2031.\n\nDespite the city council\u2019s approval for a new arena in Center City, the plan has received significant pushback due to concerns over traffic and congestion, as well as the displacement of the city\u2019s Chinatown section.\n\nAccording to Sportico, the new arena will also house the National Hockey League\u2019s (NHL) Philadelphia Flyers, who are owned by Comcast Spectator and also play at Wells Fargo Center. The venue will reportedly be a 50-50 partnership between the 76ers and the Flyers.\n\nAs well as linking up for a new arena, Comcast Spectator will join the 76ers\u2019 bid for a Women\u2019s National Basketball Association (WNBA) expansion franchise.

            "content": "Loan demand has been anemic in recent quarters, with industry data suggesting loan growth of about +1.8% in December, the best rate in over a year. Also notable is that the growth isn\u2019t solely resulting from credit cards, with commercial & industrial loans (C&I) starting to show positive growth.\n\nThe bond market\u2019s immediate reaction to the aforementioned blockbuster December jobs report has been to relatively reduce the yield curve\u2019s steepness, but it nevertheless remains far steeper than a few months back. This is positive for net interest income (NII) for these banks, with everything else being constant. There is likely further upside to current 2025 NII estimates, particularly if deposit and loan growth accelerates.\n\nThe development of elevated, longer-dated treasury yields has been an active discussion point in the market, as it seemingly runs counter to the easing monetary policy trajectory. We tend to agree with the view that the ongoing strength in long-term treasury yields is primarily a reflection of favorable economic growth expectations and rising demand for capital due to investment opportunities in secular growth areas like artificial intelligence. Part of it is tied to sticky inflation expectations, but the economic growth angle represents the most significant component.\n\nThe outlook for Fed easing that had already dampened following the \u2018hawkish cut\u2019 in December is likely to moderate further following the latest blockbuster jobs report. That said, the overall operating environment for these banks has significantly improved lately on the back of a favorable macroeconomic outlook and a relatively more permissive regulatory regime under President Trump.\n\nWells Fargo , which joins JPMorgan in kicking off the Q4 earnings season for the Finance sector on Wednesday, January 15 th , is barely in positive territory since election day, while Citigroup , which also reports the same day, has outperformed both of its peers.\n\nJPMorgan shares are down a little over -3% since their late-November highs, marginally better than the Zacks Finance sector but lagging the broader market that is essentially flat over the same period. Since the November elections, however, JPMorgan shares are up close to +2%, while the S&P 500 index is modestly in the negative.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith respect to credit quality, the problems in the commercial real estate (CRE) market are well-known and already adequately provisioned for at the major banks. Beyond CRE, aggregate bankruptcies in the U.S. are up significantly from the Covid-driven low of early 2022, but the growth rate has been leveling off in recent months.\n\nWith current bankruptcy levels roughly 30% below pre-Covid averages, the recent slowing of the bankruptcy growth pace is likely indicative of improved household balance sheets. We also see this trend in early-stage credit card delinquencies, with the flat year-over-year growth rates in recent months indicative of favorable developments concerning net charge-off rates this year.\n\nConcerning investment banking, revenues should be up in the mid-teens percentage range, with JPMorgan and other industry leaders likely enjoying gains in excess of +20%. The equity capital markets business has been particularly strong, with decent gains on the debt capital market side and some early signs of life in the M&A space. On the trading side, volumes were up strong in Q4, while fixed income, currencies, and commodities (FICC) volumes improved during the period after the flattish showing in the first three quarters of the year.\n\nExpectations for JPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Citigroup\n\nJPMorgan is expected to report $4.02 per share in earnings (up +1.3% year-over-year) on $40.9 billion in revenues (up +6.1% YoY). The stock was up nicely on the last earnings release on October 11th, reflecting positive commentary about the outlook. Estimates have been steadily increasing, with the current $4.02 per share estimate up from $3.82 a month ago and $3.79 three months back.\n\nWells Fargo is expected to report EPS of $1.34 (up +3.9% year-over-year) on $20.5 billion in revenues (up +0.1% YOY). Estimates for Q4 have inched up since the period got underway, with the current $1.34 estimate up from $1.32 a month back and $1.30 three months back. Wells Fargo shares were up following the last quarterly release on October 11th.\n\nFor Citigroup, the expectation is of $1.24 per share in earnings (up +47.6% YOY) on $19.6 billion in revenues (up +12.1%). The revisions trend has been modestly positive, with analysts nudging their estimates higher since the quarter began. Citi shares were down following the last quarterly release. But the market\u2019s reaction to any Citi quarterly release is more a function of the market\u2019s assessment of management\u2019s progress in repositioning the business and simplifying the structure than actual quarterly results. We don\u2019t think this report will be any different in that respect.\n\nThe Zacks Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are a part, is expected to earn +4.4% higher earnings in 2024 Q4 on +3.3% higher revenues. Please note that this industry brought in roughly 50% of the Zacks Finance sector\u2019s total earnings over the trailing four-quarter period.\n\nQ4 earnings for the Zacks Finance sector are expected to be up +11.3% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues.\n\nDespite the big bank stocks\u2019 outperformance over the past year, they are still cheap on most conventional valuation metrics.\n\nAt first glance, this valuation picture may look full, if not rich. But we must see the group\u2019s valuation multiple relative to the broader market.\n\nLooking relative to the S&P 500 index, the Zacks Major Banks industry is currently trading at 66% of the S&P 500 forward 12-month P/E multiple. Over the last 10 years, the industry has traded as high as 78% of the index, as low as 52%, and carries a median of 62%.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThe Q4 earnings season will take center stage with the bank results this week. However, the reporting cycle has actually gotten underway, with results from 22 S&P 500 index members. These 22 index members, including bellwether operators such as FedEx, Nike, Oracle, and others, have reported results for their fiscal quarters ending in November. We and other data aggregators count these fiscal November-quarter results as part of the December-quarter tally.\n\nThis week brings Q4 results from 18 S&P 500 members, which, in addition to the aforementioned big banks, include UnitedHealthcare, Schlumberger, Fastenal, and others.\n\nTotal earnings for the 22 index members that have reported results are up +22% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 72.7% beating EPS estimates and 68.2% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Broad-Based Growth Expected in 2025\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

            "content": "The devastating wildfires that have impacted Southern California over the last week could have insured losses topping $30 billion, according to a new analysis.\n\nAt least 24 people have been killed in the outbreak of wildfires in the greater Los Angeles area, while officials say that at least 12,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed in the blazes.\n\nFinancial analysts at Wells Fargo Securities released a report to clients on Sunday, which said that their \"base case\" for insured losses due to the wildfires was $30 billion, adding that the total losses could fall in a range between $20 billion and $40 billion.\n\nWithin that total, about 85% of losses are expected to come from homeowners' insurance policies, while 13.5% are commercial property and 1.5% are personal auto losses, the Wells Fargo analysis found. The base case noted that average property values range around $3 million in areas affected by the wildfires.\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES: ESSENTIAL PHONE NUMBERS FOR LOS ANGELES-AREA RESIDENTS AND HOW YOU CAN HELP THEM\n\n\"Regardless of outcome we see this as a manageable event for insurers,\" the Wells Fargo analysts wrote. They noted that at a total insured loss of $40 billion it would represent a 2% hit to equity for insurers.\n\nUnder the $30 billion base case for insured losses, $25.5 billion of those would come from homeowners' insurance policies compared to $4.05 billion from commercial lines and $450 million from auto insurance policies. That would result in a smaller equity hit of 1.6%.\n\nLast week, JPMorgan analysts released a preliminary estimate that insured losses would reach $20 billion. That figure would make Southern California wildfires the most damaging in the state's history, as would the $30 billion estimate by Wells Fargo.\n\nMAPS SHOW EXTENT OF WILDFIRE DEVASTATION, HOMES DESTROYED\n\nEither estimate coming to fruition would make this month's wildfires the costliest in the state of California's history, surpassing the 2018 Camp Fire which caused about $10 billion in insured losses.\n\nThe Camp Fire impacted the Northern California town of Paradise and several nearby communities, causing 85 fatalities while affecting over 18,000 buildings.\n\nCALIFORNIA BANS INSURANCE CANCELLATION, NON-RENEWALS IN LA AREAS AFFECTED BY FIRES\n\nThe composition of insured losses from the Camp Fire detailed by JPMorgan was similar when compared with the ongoing Southern California wildfires analyzed by Wells Fargo.\n\nJPMorgan's report noted that personal property losses amounted to about 86% of the losses compared with 12% for commercial property and 2% from all other lines and auto insurance. It added that because the Southern California fires are impacting larger population centers, the insured losses are expected to be higher as a result.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

            "content": "Also, a preview of announcements by Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley\n\nEarnings seasons is about to get underway.\n\nCan post-election gains in U.S. bank stocks hold through January ahead of new administration.\n\nWill bank earnings revive market sentiment as January gets off to a bearish start?\n\n\n\nEarnings season kicks off this week and, as always, some of the biggest banks are set to report their quarterly numbers. America\u2019s six biggest banks\u2014JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup(C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are set to release quarterly figures by Thursday. Together, the banks are expected to report over $30 billion in quarterly profits.\n\nThe market has sold off ahead of the reports, perhaps making this bank earnings season more important than ever. It also comes ahead of a new U.S. administration, which will likely see a myriad of changes in regulatory rules and not to mention, broader changes to economic policies.\n\nMarket conditions during the quarter ended Jan. 1 likely boosted profit margins for the banks. High rates in longer-duration bonds may have bolstered lending rates while also enabling them to borrow at an advantaged rate with lower rates along the shorter-end of the curve.\n\nAccording to a report from the Financial Times, fees for investment banking are expected to rise by about 30% for the six banks to total $8.4 billion following a drop in interest rates during the fall that led to issuing more debt. The rally in the stock market also increased mergers and acquisitions as well as equity offerings. Trading profits are also expected to increase.\n\nHowever, with rosy expectations comes the possibility that investors will be disappointed with anything but great numbers. Let\u2019s look at each bank to get an idea of what to expect.\n\n\n\n\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan Chase will report earnings on Wednesday before the market open. It will be one of the first of the six banks to report earnings for the season. JPM is the largest bank in the United States by market cap, meaning it could have an outsized market impact.\n\nTraders expect JPM to report earnings per share (EPS) of $4.09 on $41.91 billion in revenue. That would compare to an EPS of $3.04 and revenue of $38.57 billion a year ago.\n\nJPM\u2019s technical structure remains strong in 2025, sitting above its 100- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). Prices also remain above its gap higher from 220 in early November following the presidential election. An above-average earnings report could put the November swing high of 254.31 in focus.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitigroup\n\nCitigroup will report earnings on Wednesday before the market open. The bank holds a market capitalization of $135 billion.\n\nTraders expect Citi to report EPS of $1.22 on $19.51 billion in revenue. That would compare to an EPS of -$1.16 on $17.44 billion in revenue a year ago.\n\nLike JPM, C also holds a bullish technical structure. Prices are trading well above the 100- and 200-day SMAs. The post-election gains are also holding well, with the stock price up 2% since the start of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo is also set to report Wednesday morning ahead of the bell. The bank holds a market cap of $234 billion, placing it in the top three largest banks in the United States.\n\nTraders expect to see EPS of $1.35 on $20.58 billion in revenue. A year ago, WFC posted an EPS of $0.86 on $20.48 billion in revenue.\n\nWFC reflects the same strong technical structures seen in JPM and C, with prices holding well above the 100- and 200-day SMAs. Similarly, prices are also holding above the post-election gap from early November. The swing high from November at 78.13 would likely serve as resistance should prices rise after earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs will round out Wednesday morning\u2019s earnings reports from the big banks. While GS has a smaller market cap than the other banks discussed so far, its revenue from investment banking and trading will offer insight into how banks performed in the period from October to December.\n\nEarnings per share are expected to cross the wires at $8.21 with a revenue expectation of $12.36 billion. A year ago, EPS was $5.48 on revenue of $11.32 billion.\n\nGS is one of the weaker performers in the group so far this year, dropping a little over 2% for the month up until today, Jan. 13. Still, it remains above its 100- and 200-day SMAs and continues to hold its post-election gains as well. That said, a weaker-than-expected report may punish this stock more than the others in the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America\n\nBank of America is scheduled to report earnings Thursday before the market open. BAC is the second largest bank in America by market cap, totaling $345 billion. This makes it one of the most impactful earnings reports of the big banks, second only to JPMorgan.\n\nTraders expect BAC to post an EPS of $0.77 on $25.12 billion in revenue. Last year, it reported EPS of $0.35 on $23.5 billion in revenue.\n\nBAC has performed well so far this year, up about 2.2% through today, Jan. 13. Like other bank stocks, the technical structure remains bullish, with prices above the 100- and 200-day SMAs. An above-estimates earnings report could push prices up to the recent swing high of 48.08 from late November.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley will round out the big banks this week. Its earnings are scheduled for Thursday before the market open. Its wealth management arm is one of the largest of the big banks. However, its weak anti-money-laundering controls came under scrutiny last year. Its performance in this sector may help unveil how trends are unfolding amid rate cuts.\n\nTraders expect Morgan Stanley to post earnings per share of $1.70 and revenue of $15.03 billion. That would be up from EPS of $0.85 and revenue of $12.9 billion a year ago.\n\nMS is among the weaker performers this year for bank stocks, with its price down about 1.8% since the start of the year. Still, like other banks, the technical structure remains resilient. Prices remain above the 100- and 200-day SMAs. However, a weak earnings report could extend the recent declines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. @fxwestwater\n\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\n\nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive, Inc. and tastytrade, Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.",

The 76ers have been a tenant of the Comcast Spectacor-owned Wells Fargo Center since the building opened in 1996 alongside the Philadelphia Flyers, also owned by Comcast Spectacor.\n\nThe news shocked many after months of debate surrounding the controversial project. Last month, City Council passed legislation approving the $1.3 billion project, dubbed 76 Place at Market East.\n\nHarris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, which owns the 76ers, had proposed constructing the 18,500-seat arena on the edge of Chinatown, with a main entrance on Market Street. The venue would have replaced a section of the current Fashion District mall between 10th and 11th streets and sit atop SEPTA\u2019s Jefferson Station.\n\nDemolition was scheduled to begin in 2026, and HBSE wanted to open the arena in time for the 2031-32 NBA season, when the team\u2019s lease expires at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nNow, new plans include the demolition of Wells Fargo Center, to make room for a new stadium for the Philadelphia Flyers and 76ers, according to IBEW LOCAL 98 and various media outlets.\n\n\u201cThis new agreement between the 76ers and Comcast is a significant win for the 76ers, Comcast, our members and the entire City of Philadelphia. The Stadium District in South Philadelphia will be dramatically enhanced and expanded, providing the 76ers with the new state-of-the-art arena the team needs and deserves,\u201d IBEW LOCAL 98 said in a statement. \u201cComcast has also pledged to commit the financial resources needed to revive the dormant Market East corridor, which is critically important to the entire city. For IBEW Local 98 and the Trades, a $1.3 billion project just turned into a multi-billion development that will create a stunning new stadium district that will keep our members working for decades.\u201d\n\nThe news was welcomed by various activist groups advocating for Chinatown, the city\u2019s historic Asian American hub, who had vigorously opposed the Center City arena plans, as well as lawmakers who had publicly opposed the arena.\n\n\u201cWe knew this deal was bad from the beginning. Anybody following the issue closely could clearly see this was a power struggle between billionaires and corporations,\u201d City Councilmembers Kendra Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke said in a joint statement. \u201cThis outcome would not have been possible without the courage and dedication of community leaders, organizers and Philadelphians who spoke up and fought back. Your voices made all the difference.\u201d\n\nMayor Cherelle Parker, who has championed the project since announcing her support for it in September, is expected to hold a news conference on Monday morning. Check MetroPhiladelphia.com for details.\n\nReporter Jack Tomczuk contributed to this report.",

            "content": "The Philadelphia 76ers have dropped plans for a new arena in Center City and will instead partner with Comcast for a venue in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, where the team currently plays. The new building will house the NBA team and NHL\u2019s Philadelphia Flyers, who are owned by Comcast Spectacor, according to a source familiar with the details who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nErnest Owens of Philadelphia magazine was the first to break the news.\n\nThe Sixers\u2019 current lease at Wells Fargo Center runs until 2031, and the team has spent two years laying the groundwork for a new NBA arena in downtown Philadelphia. It also explored building a new arena in New Jersey, which was \u201cmore real than people realized,\u201d according to a source.\n\nThe new building will keep the NHL and NBA teams in the same stadium district that also houses the NFL\u2019s Philadelphia Eagles and MLB\u2019s Philadelphia Phillies. The arena will be a 50-50 partnership between the 76ers, who are owned by Josh Harris and David Blitzer, and the Flyers. The 76ers are currently a tenant at Wells Fargo Center and capture limited arena revenue outside of tickets.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Comcast will take a minority stake in the 76ers and will partner with Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) to help bring a WNBA team to the city, the NBA said in a press release on Monday. Comcast will also have naming rights to the new building.\n\nIn December, the Philadelphia city council approved the 76ers\u2019 plan for a $1.3 billion arena in the Center City section of the city, but there has been significant opposition to the plan regarding the disruption a new arena would bring. The Sixers still plan to make real estate developments and investments in Market East of Center City, per the source.\n\nThe new partnership between HBSE and Comcast Spectacor came together during the holidays. The ties between the two run deep. In addition to being a landlord for the 76ers, Comcast is the team\u2019s local media partner as the owner of NBC Sports Philadelphia. The media giant also just secured broadcast rights for its NBC and Peacock channels as part of the NBA\u2019s new 11-year, $77 billion rights deal that also includes ESPN and Amazon. Comcast recently completed a $400 million renovation of the Wells Fargo Center to modernize the building that opened in 1996.\n\nIn addition to reaching an agreement on a new building, Comcast will join the 76ers\u2019 bid for a WNBA expansion team. In September, the WNBA hired Allen & Company to lead the expansion process for a 16th WNBA team. The expansion fee is expected to be in the neighborhood of $100 million, with a significant commitment also required for startup costs and to build a practice facility.\n\n\n\n(This story has been updated in the fifth paragraph with news of Comcast\u2019s stake in the 76ers and naming rights to the new arena.)",

            "content": "Editor's Note (Jan. 13, 2025, 1:49 p.m.): City, business and sports leaders announced the plan to build a new arena in partnership in South Philadelphia. Check out their remarks.\n\nIn a move that will likely stun many, the plan to bring a $1.3 billion arena to Market Street in Center City Philadelphia has been abandoned.\n\nOn Sunday, around noon, a union representative and city official confirmed with NBC10 that the team has worked out a new deal with Comcast Spectacor and has backpedaled on a plan that would have brought an arena to the area of the intersection of Market and Filbert streets at 10th and 11th streets.\n\nRyan Boyer, president of the Philadelphia Building & Construction Trades Council, told NBC10's Lauren Mayk that instead, the team plans to demolish Wells Fargo Center and will eventually build a new arena in South Philadelphia for the Sixers and Flyers.\n\nGet top local stories in Philly delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Philadelphia's News Headlines newsletter.\n\n\"We actually get more jobs,\" Boyer said. \"For the building trades, this is good news.\"\n\nIn a statement released Sunday afternoon, officials with Local 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also celebrated the decision, saying that the move will see the stadium district in South Philadelphia \"enhanced and expanded.\"\n\n\u201cIBEW Local 98 and our partners in the Philadelphia Building Trades have worked diligently with the 76ers throughout this protracted process. This new agreement between the 76ers and Comcast is a significant win for the 76ers, Comcast, our members and the entire City of Philadelphia. The Stadium District in South Philadelphia will be dramatically enhanced and expanded, providing the 76ers with the new state-of-the-art arena the team needs and deserves,\" an IBEW representative said in a statement. \"Comcast has also pledged to commit the financial resources needed to revive the dormant Market East corridor, which is critically important to the entire city. For IBEW Local 98 and the Trades, a $1.3 billion project just turned into a multi-billion development that will create a stunning new stadium district that will keep our members working for decades.\u201d\n\nHowever, Philadelphia City Councilmember at-large, Jim Harrity, said he was disappointed in the surprise move. In fact, he said, he felt \"bamboozled.\"\n\n\"I feel completely bamboozled,\u201d Harrity said. \"I'm not going to forget this... I feel they not only bamboozled me but bamboozled the citizens of Philadelphia and I\u2019m not going to forget that.\u201d\n\nHarrity said he is upset that the city's schools won't get the promised money from taxes the new arena would bring.\n\nThe plan had been approved by Philadelphia's City Council late last year.\n\nThe plan had long been a contentious one, with many residents in communities closest to the project site protesting against it since it was initially proposed.\n\nIn the late months of last year, in the run up to a City Council vote on the project, city officials -- including Mayor Cherelle Parker -- met with members of the community all across the city to determine the future of the project.\n\nBefore City Council eventually approved the plan on Dec. 19, 2024, a main issue with the project was just how much funding would be included in the community benefits agreement. Initially, developers proposed a $50 million agreement, but residents closest to the project called for more -- as much as $300 million.\n\nEventually, City Council approved the plan with a $60 million community benefits agreement.\n\nDevelopers had planned to begin development this year and open the arena in 2031.\n\nThe specifics of the deal that led to the decision to stay in South Philadelphia have not yet been provided by officials.\n\nBut, according to a source with information on the situation, the Sixers and Flyers are expected to partner on a new arena in South Philadelphia with Comcast Spectacor.\n\nThe Sixers and Comcast Spectacor will also work on a revitalization project for the Market East neighborhood in Center City Philadelphia, according to the source.\n\nPhiladelphia councilmember Kendra Brooks -- who had opposed the Center City plan -- was happy with Sunday's news but wanted more details on the new deal.\n\n\u201cWe said that we didn\u2019t think that this was a good deal from the beginning, both Nicolas O\u2019Rourke and I. As minority leaders, we both said that we were gonna go with the side of the people,\" Brooks said. \u201cI\u2019m interested to know the details behind what happened. We spent a lot of time and effort and resources on hearings that lasted through the end of the year that could have been spent towards other issues that we\u2019ve been focusing on. So, I\u2019d really like to know the details and what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nThe No Arena Coalition -- a group made up of thousands of organizations strongly opposed to the Center City arena plan -- also reacted to Sunday's news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re relieved to hear that the nightmare of a Center City Sixers arena will not haunt our city any more. To every Philadelphian who called, marched, testified, and warned City Hall that this was a raw deal: This win belongs to you, and the lesson for politicians is to trust the people. To the five Councilmembers who stood on the right side of this fight: We will not forget,\" a spokesperson for the group wrote.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, Philly built a movement not only to save Chinatown, but to defend our entire city from predatory billionaires who saw us for a profit playground, and tens of thousands of Philadelphians showed up. When some said it was a done deal, this movement stayed true, committed to a different kind of city.\"\n\nA press conference on the decision is expected to be held on Monday morning, Jan. 13, 2025.\n\nContacted on Sunday, officials with the Sixers, Comcast and the City of Philadelphia, did not immediately return requests for comment.",

It was his first game in Philadelphia since being traded a year ago after declining to sign with the Flyers.\n\nStay in the game with the latest updates on your beloved Philadelphia sports teams! Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.\n\nThe Flyers (18-20-5) badly needed a win and got one to snap a four-game skid (0-3-1). Just two days ago, they were the ones receiving boos at the Wells Fargo Center from an ugly 4-1 loss to the Stars.\n\n\"Especially how flat we were last game, I think the crowd gave us a huge boost just to start the night tonight,\" Frost said. \"We wanted to bounce back for them. It was fun out there.\"\n\nThe Flyers swept the two-game regular-season series from the Ducks (17-20-5). They beat Anaheim, 3-1, two weeks ago at Honda Center.\n\n\"All I told our team is let's worry about ourselves and play a hockey game,\" head coach John Tortorella said. \"The bulls--t's for you guys (the media), all the drama and all that, that's for you guys, whatever you need to do with it. All I was concerned about, and I expressed it to the guys \u2014 let's play the game the proper way, especially how badly we played the prior game.\"\n\n\u2022 Drysdale electrified the crowd when he extended the Flyers' lead to 2-0 with a power play marker in the first period.\n\nThe 22-year-old defenseman was the player the Flyers acquired in the Gauthier trade. A loud chant of \"Jamie's better\" broke out after the goal.\n\n\"It was pretty special, you hear the crowd going like that,\" Drysdale said. \"It brings so much energy to myself and the whole team. Unbelievable fans and they were rocking tonight.\"\n\nThings turned chippy toward the end of the first period and continued in the second and third. Travis Konecny had some words with Gauthier after a whistle in the middle stanza. Later in the period, he assisted Tippett's goal, which padded the Flyers' lead to 3-0.\n\nPoehling's goal came just 24 seconds into the final stanza and the rout was on for the Flyers. After Michkov joined the act, more Gauthier chants ensued. Hathaway then scored under a minute and a half later.\n\nKonecny finished with four assists and five other Flyers had multi-point games.\n\n\"The crowd was really into it tonight, it was awesome, a great atmosphere,\" Konecny said. \"We just played hard, we've been playing hard and not getting results. It was good to get one tonight.\"\n\nThe Flyers took a 2-0 lead in the first period thanks to Jamie Drysdale, who was playing against his former team.\n\n\u2022 Samuel Ersson recorded his seventh career shutout with 22 saves.\n\nThe 25-year-old provided a stabilizing performance in net, where the Flyers have had all kinds of difficulty.\n\n\"I think my game is in a good place,\" Ersson said. \"I obviously struggled a little bit there before Christmas, but after that, I think it has been good.\"\n\nAnaheim netminder John Gibson stopped 24 of the Flyers' 30 shots.\n\nThe Flyers routed the Ducks, 6-0, as Cutter Gauthier made his first trip to Philadelphia.\n\n\u2022 Joel Farabee was healthy scratched, which brought an end to his ironman streak at 216 games. Olle Lycksell drew into the lineup and played on Sean Couturier's line along with Michkov.\n\n\u2022 The Flyers are back in action Monday when they host the defending champion Panthers (7 p.m. ET/NBCSP).\n\nSubscribe anywhere you get your podcasts:\n\nApple Podcasts | Youtube Music | Spotify | Stitcher | Simplecast | RSS | Watch on YouTube",

            "content": "Business Insider's personal finance team compared Wells Fargo CDs to the best CDs and found it to be a standard offering. Some CD rates at Wells Fargo are good, but Wells Fargo requires a hefty minimum opening deposit, and it doesn't offer many CD terms.\n\nWells Fargo only offers fixed-rate CDs, which means your rate will remain the same throughout the entire term. Wells Fargo CDs are also FDIC-insured, which means they're a relatively safe place to keep money because if there is a bank failure, the FDIC protects up to $250,000 per depositor. FDIC insurance typically applies to all bank accounts.\n\nYou'll want to consider another financial institution if you'd like to open a variable-rate CD, like a step-up CD. Step-up CDs offer a guaranteed rate increase at a specific date.\n\nCurrent Wells Fargo CD Rates\n\nWells Fargo Standard Fixed Rate CD Rates\n\nA Wells Fargo Standard Fixed Rate CD offers 2.00% to 2.01% APY.\n\nWells Fargo has standard rates and relationship rates. You can qualify for a relationship rate when you link Wells Fargo Prime Checking, Wells Fargo Premier Checking, or Wells Fargo Private Bank Interest Checking.\n\nWells Fargo CD rates aren't strong for its standard CDs. If you want a competitive CD rate at Well Fargo, a Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD is probably a better fit.\n\nWells Fargo CD rates are the same in many areas, but they can vary depending on where you live. We used a zip code from New York City for the following Wells Fargo CD rates:\n\nStandard Fixed Rate Term Standard APY Relationship APY 3-month 2.00% 2.01% 6-month 2.00% 2.01% 1-year 2.00% 2.01%\n\nWells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD Rates\n\nA Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD pays 3.50% to 4.26% (varies by location) APY, depending on the term.\n\nA Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD offers a higher interest rate than the average CD. The Wells Fargo standard CD rates are better than you can find at many other brick-and-mortar banks, but they aren't as strong as you can find at top online banks for CDs.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD might be worthwhile if you have $5,000 or more to open an account because this Wells Fargo CD rate is better regardless of your account balance.\n\nWe used a zip code from New York City for the following Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD rates:\n\nSpecial Fixed Rate Term Standard APY Relationship APY 4-month 4.00% 4.26% 7-month 3.75% 4.01% 11-month 3.50% 3.76%\n\nOverview of Wells Fargo CDs\n\nWells Fargo has two CD options: standard CDs and special CDs. The primary difference between the two accounts is that Wells Fargo special CD rates are more competitive than Wells Fargo standard CD rates, but Wells Fargo special CDs also have higher minimum opening deposits than Wells Fargo standard CDs.\n\nOther brick-and-mortar banks tend to have more online term options. You could also find more specialty CDs at different banks and credit unions. Notably, some of the best banks and credit unions offer no-penalty CDs, add-on CDs, or bump-up CDs.\n\nWells Fargo CD Rate Pros and Cons\n\nWells Fargo CD Rate Pros\n\nNational branch presence which might make it more convenient to monitor CD rates, renew terms, or initiate a CD account closure\n\nWells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD rates are competitive\n\nInterest has daily compounding\n\nWells Fargo CD Rate Cons\n\nHigh minimum opening deposit requirements compared to other banks\n\nOther financial institutions offer higher online CD rates for 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year terms\n\nOther financial institutions offer more online CD variety (specialty CDs and more term options)\n\nWells Fargo CD Alternatives\n\nWells Fargo CDs vs. U.S. Bank CDs\n\nU.S. Bank offers four types of CDs: special CDs, standard CDs, step-up CDs, and trade-up CDs. A trade-up CD allows you to request a rate increase at a U.S. Bank branch once during a term if interest rates go up.\n\nIn general, U.S. Bank CD rates aren't as high as Wells Fargo CD rates. All of U.S. Bank's CDs, except for its CD specials, offer interest rates of less than 1% APY. While U.S. Bank special CD rates are higher than the standard terms, at 3.20% to 4.00% (Varies by location) APY, Wells Fargo special CD rates are still even more impressive at 3.50% to 4.26% (varies by location). That being said, U.S. Bank's special CDs offer longer term lengths.\n\nYou also might lean more toward U.S. Bank if you'd like to open a CD with a low minimum opening deposit. U.S. Bank lets you open an account with $500. At Wells Fargo, you need at least $2,500.\n\nU.S. Bank Review\n\nWells Fargo CDs vs. Capital One CDs\n\nCapital One 360 CD might be a better option if your priority is opening a CD with a low initial deposit. Capital One 360 lets you open a CD with $0. With Wells Fargo CDs, you need at least $2,500. Capital One also has better term lengths, offering CDs with term lengths up to 5 years, while Wells Fargo only offers CDs with term lengths up to 1 year.\n\nCapital One CD rates pay 3.50% to 4.00% APY, which is comparable to Wells Fargo special CD rates. The best CD option for you may ultimately depend on which term you're looking for.\n\nCapital One 360 Bank Review\n\nHow to Open a Wells Fargo CD\n\nWells Fargo CDs can be opened online or at a nearby branch. Bear in mind the bank offers additional term options if you visit a branch.\n\nTo open a CD, you must be at least 18 years old. If you apply online, you'll need to include a Social Security number or ITIN number, a U.S. address, and a phone number. If you apply at a branch, you must take physical documents verifying your identity and home address. People who aren't U.S. citizens or permanent residents can use a foreign passport or Matricula Consular if they don't have a U.S. ID.\n\nA Wells Fargo Standard Fixed Rate CD has a $2,500 minimum opening deposit, and a Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD has a $5,000 minimum opening deposit. These requirements are pretty steep compared to other banks. Usually, only $1,000 is required to open a CD.\n\nShould You Open a Wells Fargo CD?\n\nWells Fargo might be worth considering if you are searching for a short-term CD at a brick-and-mortar bank of one year or less. In particular, a Wells Fargo Special Fixed Rate CD could be worthwhile if you are looking for a good CD rate. These CD rates also more higher than Wells Fargo savings account interest rates, which could make them worthwhile if you don't plan to accessing some of your money anytime soon.\n\nWells Fargo probably won't be the best option if you're searching for CDs with low opening requirements. Other financial institutions let you open CDs with $1,000 or less. Wells Fargo CDs require $2,500 to $5,000, depending on which type of CD you open.\n\nYou also might prefer a different bank if you prefer more CD variety while applying online. Generally, most financial institutions at least offer CDs ranging from three months to five years.\n\nThere are also financial institutions that offer other types of CDs. For example, some banks have no-penalty CDs, which do not charge early withdrawal penalties if you need to take out money before a term ends.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Wells Fargo CDs\n\nFor our Wells Fargo CD review, we rate bank accounts on a scale from one to five stars. For our CD review, we used our CD methodology, which looks at interest rates, minimum opening deposits, early withdrawal penalties, CD variety, customer support availability, mobile app ratings, miscellaneous features, security, and the ethics of the company.\n\nWe use a weighted average to get our star rating, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience.\n\nWells Fargo CDs FAQs\n\nWhat are the current CD rates at Wells Fargo?

He and Aylward will work alongside Fernando Rivas, who was hired as co-CEO of Wells Fargo\u2019s investment bank last year from JPMorgan. Aylward and Anderson\u2019s exact titles and leadership positions will be determined in early 2025.\n\nThe duo will join Christina Bresani, who Wells Fargo hired as a managing director in 2024 from William Blair & Co. LLC to run its midcap M&A group. (Bresani was a guest on the Activist Investing Today podcast in 2023.) Well Fargo wants to rebuild its midcap practice aggressively under Jeff Hogan, global head of M&A and former vice chairman of Morgan Stanley, who was hired in 2023.\n\nAs for Aylward, at JPMorgan he advised Blackstone Products on its combination with privately owned Weber LLC in a deal announced last month. Blackstone\u2019s outdoor griddles business and the operations of BDT and MSD Partners LLC holding Weber are expected to have a combined value of almost $10 billion, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\nWhile at JPMorgan, Aylward also advised Saudi Aramco on its $2.65 billion acquisition of Valvoline Inc.\u2019s Products Business and Encore Wire Corp. on its $4.2 billion sale to Prysmian SpA.\n\nAt Wells Fargo, Aylward is expected to focus on deals involving publicly traded companies with $250 million to $2 billion market capitalizations, as well as building a dedicated M&A practice advising family-owned, founder-owned and closely held companies. At JPMorgan, in addition to working on publicly traded deals, Aylward created a team dedicated to advising on family-owned and closely held business deals, as well as governance improvements and the liquidation of minority stakes.\n\nBefore JPMorgan Chase, Justin Aylward was a senior dealmaker at Blackstone Inc. and Paul Taubman\u2019s PJT Partners Inc.

            "content": "Wells Fargo & Company WFC is slated to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Jan. 15, 2025, before market open.\n\n\n\nAmong Wells Fargo\u2019s close peers, JPMorgan JPM and Citigroup Inc. C are also slated to announce quarterly numbers on Jan. 15. Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n\n\nWFC\u2019s third-quarter performance benefited from higher non-interest income. However, the decrease in net interest income (NII) was spoilsport. This time, we believe the company\u2019s performance will remain decent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $20.61 billion suggests a 1.23% year-over-year decline.\n\n\n\nIn the past seven days, the consensus estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised marginally upward to $1.34. This indicates a 3.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWFC has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 12.54%.\n\nEarnings Surprise History\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors to Influence WFC\u2019s Q4 Results\n\nLoans and Net Interest Income (NII): In the fourth quarter, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points to 4.25-4.5%. This, along with the rate cut in September, is likely to have offered some support to Wells Fargo\u2019s net interest income (NII) as the rise in funding/deposit costs declined.\n\n\n\nAlso, clarity on the Fed\u2019s rate cut path and the stabilizing macroeconomic backdrop are likely to have provided support to the lending scenario. Per the Fed\u2019s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer loans was decent in the first two months of the quarter. Thus, the company\u2019s lending activity is likely to have witnessed an improvement in the quarter to be reported.\n\n\n\nManagement expects fourth-quarter NII to be in line with the third-quarter 2024 reported figure of $11.7 billion.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is pegged at $11.67 billion, which remained unchanged from the previous quarter.\n\n\n\nNon-Interest Revenues: Mortgage rates in the fourth quarter of 2024 were close to 6.8%, slightly higher than the 6.2% observed at the end of the third quarter. Despite the central bank's interest rate cuts, mortgage rates did not decline significantly. As a result of these fluctuations, refinancing activities and origination volumes did not experience significant growth but remained at decent levels.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 is pegged at $269.4 million, suggesting a 3.8% decline from the prior quarter\u2019s levels.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues are likely to have improved from higher market valuations and transactional activities. The consensus mark for investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues is pegged at $2.5 billion for the fourth quarter 2024, indicating a sequential rise of 1.2%.\n\n\n\nGlobal mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the fourth quarter of 2024 showed marked improvement after subdued 2023 and 2022. This is expected to have supported Well Fargo\u2019s Investment Banking (IB) fees.\n\n\n\nBoth deal value and volume were robust during the quarter, driven by solid financial performance, robust U.S. economic growth, buoyant markets and interest rate cuts. Also, the potential easing of regulatory oversight on M&As by the incoming Trump administration fueled deal-making activities. Yet, lingering geopolitical issues were a headwind.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income in the fourth quarter of 2024 is pegged at $667.5 million, which remained flat on a sequential basis.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Card fees for the fourth quarter of 2024 is pegged at $1.07 billion, suggesting a decline of 1.8% on a sequential basis.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo\u2019s total non-interest income for the final quarter of 2024 is pegged at $8.75 billion, indicating an increase of nearly 1% sequentially.\n\n\n\nExpenses: Wells Fargo\u2019s costs are expected to have continued flaring up in the fourth quarter, given its investments in technology and digitalization efforts. This is likely to have hindered bottom-line growth in the quarter to be reported.\n\n\n\nAsset Quality: Wells Fargo is likely to have set aside a huge amount of money for potential delinquent loans (mainly commercial loan defaults), given the expectations of higher for longer interest rate backdrop.\n\n\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, the consensus mark for total non-accrual loans is pegged at $8.51 billion, suggesting a sequential rise of 4.2%. In the same quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing assets of $8.65 billion indicates a 3.2% increase from the previous quarter.",

            "content": "A hotter-than-expected December jobs report sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling by more than 600 points (1.5%) on Friday morning as U.S. Treasury yields continued to rise and inflation concerns took center stage. Most sectors struggled, including financials.\n\nShares of Wells Fargo (WFC 3.49%) were trading 2.6% lower as of 11:46 a.m. ET, while investment bank Jefferies Financial (JEF 3.81%) was off by 11.4% and private equity giant Blackstone (BX 3.19%) was down by roughly 5%.\n\nYields, jobs, and yields again\n\nSince mid-December, investors have grown increasingly concerned about sticky inflation, an issue that is also top of mind for the Federal Reserve. The Fed has pared back its forecast for interest rate cuts in 2025 from four to two. The market is even more pessimistic on the outlook for rate cuts, and Friday's jobs report didn't help. Nonfarm payrolls in December added 256,000 jobs, 100,000 more than the Dow Jones consensus, and up from 212,000 in November. If there was a silver lining in that jobs report, it would be that hourly wages grew 0.3% from the prior month, in line with expectations. Hourly wages grew 3.9% year over year, slightly below estimates.\n\nTraders betting on how the Fed will deal with the federal funds rate now see virtually no chance of a rate cut in January, and 75% of traders think the Fed will leave rates unchanged in March as well. About 40% of traders only expect one rate cut in 2025.\n\n\"The surprisingly strong jobs report certainly isn't going to make the Fed less hawkish,\" Morgan Stanley Chief Economic Strategist Ellen Zentner told CNBC. \"All eyes will now turn to next week's inflation data, but even a downside surprise in those numbers probably won't be enough to get the Fed to cut rates any time soon.\"\n\nThere wasn't much company-specific news Friday in the sector, but higher interest rates can have several consequences for banks and financial institutions. Prominent among them, they increase the cost of deposits and renew credit concerns, particularly for commercial real estate loans. Blackstone has many real estate investments, and their borrowing costs increase when rates are higher, which could put a dent in valuations. Additionally, higher rates and more volatility can spell trouble for investment banking activity, which investors in the sector are hoping will rebound this year.\n\nJefferies is a pure-play investment bank. On Wednesday, it reported earnings that were up 200% from the same period a year ago, powered by a rebound in deal-making, so perhaps activity will still improve this year. However, the high interest rate environment has hindered deal-making and initial public offerings over the last few years. The persistence of higher rates for longer could put the brakes on that activity.\n\nOn the bright side...\n\nI'm still optimistic about the outlook for financials this year. Yes, market rates on Treasuries are going up, but the yield curve is still steepening, which is a nice change from the past few years and should help bank margins. Furthermore, President-elect Donald Trump's administration should be more favorable for banks, with looser regulation and less stringent capital requirements, and with regulatory agencies run by appointees who will be more quick to approve bank acquisitions.\n\nInvestors should remember that the outlook for interest rates can change quickly. Next week, new inflation data will come out, and a weak reading may help bring yields down a bit. It's also better to see yields rising as the yield curve steepens, as that can indicate economic expansion. The near term will be volatile, with elevated yields and investors trying to predict the impact of Trump's potential tariffs and other policies. Still, I don't think bank stocks like Wells Fargo and Jefferies are a bad play now.",

You'll earn 2% cash rewards on all eligible purchases and there are no bonus categories to track. Before signing up for this credit card, consider your spending habits. If you spend a lot on dining or travel, a card that earns bonus rewards for those purchases may make more sense. On the other hand, anyone who would rather not worry about maximizing spending categories will appreciate being able to earn a high flat-rate return everywhere. Redeeming Regardless of how you use your rewards, the value is the same. You can redeem your cash rewards in a variety of ways, including: Statement credit to offset purchases ($1 minimum)\n\nWells Fargo ATM withdrawal using a Wells Fargo debit or ATM card ($20 increments)\n\nA credit to an eligible Wells Fargo credit card, checking account or mortgage\n\nGift cards\n\nPayPal purchases\n\nRates and fees\n\nThe Active Cash card has no annual fee.

Late payments can be assessed a fee of up to $40.

New Discover it Cash Back cardholders receive a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months from account opening (then the APR is a variable 18.24% to 27.24%). There is a 3% intro balance transfer fee of up to 5% on future balance transfers (see rates and fees; terms apply).

If you're looking for a sign-up bonus, Wells Fargo is likely the better choice.\n\nFor checking accounts, Bank of America offers a $300 bonus for new customers who open a new eligible personal checking account online with qualifying activities (offer expires January 31, 2025). This is lower than Wells Fargo's checking bonus. Wells Fargo also offers a substantial savings bonus if you can deposit at least $25,000, while Bank of America doesn't have a savings bonus at all.\n\nIf you take bonuses out of the equation, Bank of America might be the better choice for a savings account. With the Bank of America Advantage Savings Account, you won't have to worry about monthly service fees during the first six months of opening an account. If you get the Wells Fargo Way2Save\u00ae Savings Account you'll need to meet certain requirements every month to waive a $5 monthly service fee.\n\nBank of America Review\n\nWells Fargo vs. Chase\n\nChase and Wells Fargo are two of the largest national banks in the US. Your choice between the two might depend on where you live. Otherwise, your decision could rely on differences between bank account features and perks.\n\nYou might favor Wells Fargo over Chase if you're only looking to open a checking account. Wells Fargo makes it easier to waive the monthly service fee than Chase. You can earn a $300 bonus when you open an account and make direct deposits totaling $500 or more within 90 days of coupon enrollment (offer expires on 4/16/2025) with Chase Total Checking\u00ae account. While this bonus is easier to earn than Wells Fargo's checking bonus, it's still not quite as high. Chase also doesn't offer a savings bonus.\n\nChase Bank Review\n\nShould You Bank with Wells Fargo?\n\nWells Fargo is a decent option if you want to bank with a brick-and-mortar financial institution. It has an extensive branch and ATM network, so you'll likely find a nearby branch in many states. Wells Fargo also has a variety of bank accounts, credit cards, mortgages, and loan types. Hence, it may also be worthwhile if you want to bank with one financial institution primarily.\n\nIf you're interested in competitive savings or CD rates, other financial institutions may be more suitable choices. Wells Fargo also has many common bank fees like monthly service fees and overdraft fees. There are ways to waive these fees at Wells Fargo. That said, keep in mind that some banks and credit unions do not charge these fees at all.\n\nWhy You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Wells Fargo\n\nTo review Wells Fargo, we rated accounts and services using our editorial standards.\n\nAt Business Insider, we rate products on a scale from one to five stars. We review different features for distinct products.\n\nIn general, we look at ethics, security, customer support, miscellaneous features, and mobile apps when rating a bank account. Other factors we consider depend on which type of account we're reviewing. For example, we look at overdraft protection for checking accounts, and early withdrawal penalties for CDs.\n\nWe use a weighted average to get our star rating for bank accounts, which means we weigh certain features, like interest rates and fees, at a higher weight percentage than others. We understand that these areas can more heavily impact a person's overall banking experience.\n\nWe also used distinct methodologies for reviewing credit cards, personal loans, student loans, home loans, and investment accounts. For example, we examined annual fees and rewards rates with credit cards, and we looked at fees and term options with personal loans.\n\nSophia Acevedo Banking Editor Sophia Acevedo is a banking editor at Business Insider.

The bank and the FinTech startup partnered in 2022 on a card that lets users pay their rent while earning rewards points.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported in June that Wells Fargo was losing as much as $10 million a month on the program after bank executives made projections on revenue sources that ended up being wrong. It also said Wells Fargo was negotiating its arrangement with Bilt and didn\u2019t plan to renew its contract scheduled to end in 2029.\n\nRepresentatives for both companies denied the relationship was in doubt when reached for comment by PYMNTS at the time of the WSJ report.\n\nIn May, Wells Fargo launched a business credit card designed to provide easy-to-understand cash rewards, saying the new Signify Business Cash Worldwide Elite Mastercard offers unlimited 2% cash rewards on business purchases, with no annual fee and no caps or categories to track.\n\n\u201cBusiness owners told us that cash rewards programs had become too complex and didn\u2019t provide enough value for their businesses,\u201d Jeff Hoffman, head of Small Business Card for Wells Fargo, said at the time in a press release.",

            "content": "Fraught with worry over high housing costs, impending student loan payments, and compounding credit card debt, millennials face financial challenges unlike other generations. Yet they\u2019re still the generation that\u2019s most money obsessed\u2014and the one that wants to show it off.\n\nWhile more than half of affluent millennials say they\u2019ve been \u201cgreatly affected\u201d by the cost-of-living crisis, 59% feel it is important to \u201clook or appear\u201d financially successful to others, according to a recent Wells Fargo study. This is yet another sign of \u201cmoney dysmorphia\u201d (as Intuit Credit Karma dubs it), in which people obsess over the idea of being rich so much so, that they lose sight of the actual state of their finances.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more telling is that Wells Fargo\u2019s study actually focuses on \u201caffluent\u201d millennials who make at least $250,000 a year, which means it\u2019s not just lower-income young people who feel the need to keep up with the Joneses, so to speak. More than 40% of the approximately 1,000 respondents said it\u2019s important to have visible signs of wealth, whether it be purchasing a fancy car, clothing, or place to live. By comparison, just 21% of Gen Xers, 8% of baby boomers, and 7% of the silent generation feel the same.\n\n\u201cAffluent millennials are, in fact, working hard and gaining financial success,\u201d Emily Irwin, managing director of advice and planning for Wells Fargo, tells Fortune. \u201cYet they\u2019re grappling with this external image, and as a result, there\u2019s a growing trend to present themselves with an image that isn\u2019t reflective [of] their actual financial situation. For some, it could be even be a \u2018fake it until you make it\u2019 mentality.\u201d\n\nEven some of the wealthiest millennials face money dysmorphia, and more than 40% of them have to rely on credit cards or loans to fund their lifestyle\u2014all while accumulating debt, the Wells Fargo survey shows. The national average debt among credit card holders during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6,864, according to LendingTree. And millennials are among the consumers struggling most with unpaid balances.\n\n\u201cMillennials have seen the largest increase in their delinquency rates and now have rates definitely above pre-pandemic levels,\u201d New York Federal Reserve researchers said in a November 2023 press call. \u201cGiven the strong labor market and general economy, these increases are somewhat surprising.\u201d\n\nSocial media fuels spending anxiety among millennials\n\nBut it\u2019s not so surprising how much millennials spend when we look at how easily and how often they\u2019re influenced by social media\u2014whether in the form of advertisements or subtle (or not so subtle) nudges from influencers.",

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wells Fargo.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Wells Fargo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Wells Fargo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Wells Fargo. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.8% and 4.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Wells Fargo\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo & Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$227m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Wells Fargo. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

            "content": "As part of its banking inclusion initiative, Wells Fargo will soon add financial coaches and offer free workshops within certain branches in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThose additions are part of the lender\u2019s goal to have 50 HOPE Inside centers providing free financial education services within certain branches by the end of 2026, said Michael Martino, the head of diverse customer segments for consumer and small-business banking at San Francisco-based Wells.\n\nThe centers, offered through Wells\u2019 partnership with financial empowerment nonprofit Operation HOPE, are already in more than 20 cities including Atlanta, Houston, Philadelphia and Seattle, as well as midsize markets like Anchorage, Alaska, and smaller ones like Gallup, New Mexico.\n\nWells has attracted its share of scrutiny for approving significantly more mortgage applications from white borrowers than Black ones and allegedly conducting sham job interviews to satisfy a diverse-hire policy. The bank commissioned a third-party racial equity audit in 2022 and revamped the hiring procedure in question.\n\nMartino also leads Wells\u2019 banking inclusion initiative, which is the lender\u2019s commitment to help unbanked and underserved communities access low-cost bank products and financial education. That includes services like Wells\u2019 BankOn checking product and its small-dollar loan offering. During a recent interview with Banking Dive, Martino shed light on other ways the bank seeks to narrow racial gaps in unbanked and underbanked segments.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nBANKING DIVE: How does Wells Fargo consider and act on the findings from the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. survey on unbanked and underbanked households, which showed persistent racial disparities?\n\nMICHAEL MARTINO: Individuals that are still unbanked are disproportionately Black, Hispanic or Native American. There\u2019s still a sense of distrust and that fees are still too high. Unbanked and underserved individuals continue to operate in a cash manner. One of the challenges with that is things are moving more digitally. It\u2019s good to see unbanked individuals embracing digital capabilities. Our biggest opportunity is, how do we take those individuals adopting digital more frequently and translate that into financial services? As we educate people, how do we get them more comfortable with the tools that are out there for them?\n\nMichael Martino Permission granted by Wells Fargo\n\nWe\u2019ve been focused on providing services that are in language and in culture, to create that sense of trust and transparency. For our Hispanic/Latino community, we now provide a digital account opening process entirely in Spanish, so an individual can follow the account opening process in their native language and really have a good sense of transparency, which leads to trust. We launched that last October and we\u2019ve gotten great feedback on it. We\u2019ve also put our [artificial intelligence]-powered virtual assistant Fargo in Spanish, and put our LifeSync tool, which provides a digital roadmap in terms of your budget and credit, in Spanish.\n\nWhat about in-person efforts at branches?\n\nWe partner with Operation HOPE, an organization that\u2019s focused on the experience of unbanked or underserved individuals coming into our branches. They provide budgeting opportunities, help them improve credit scores, increase savings and reduce debt.\n\nWe\u2019re very strategic about where we place our HOPE Inside centers within branches. When we place those, we try to focus on all underserved communities. We do Operation HOPE grand welcomes: go into the community, spend the day welcoming people into the branch, we have food trucks, community partners there, we make it a whole experience for them so they can take care of all sorts of needs. We introduce individuals to the coaches at the branch, talk about making appointments and getting their budgets going.\n\nWe have 27 HOPE Inside centers within our branches. There\u2019s a hub-and-spoke approach, so they cover four to five other branches in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. Our goal is, by 2026, to have 50 HOPE Inside centers.\n\nOne of the things that we\u2019ll be kicking off in January is a branch banking financial coach, and those individuals will do something very similar to what our HOPE Inside coaches do. This is our opportunity to really scale and do even more, and build out this work inside Wells Fargo.\n\nHow does Wells address a tricky issue like lack of trust in banks?\n\nWe look at creating transparency through products and services that appeal to individuals, where they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being taken advantage of. When there\u2019s few banks, people don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s choice, necessarily, so it\u2019s about putting resources in communities with few banks and providing spaces for them to bank. Operation HOPE has a great reputation around education and proven results in helping individuals improve credit scores and increase savings, so we help bring them into the mainstream of banking, which creates trust. And we partner with community groups like the NAACP and UnidosUS. These are organizations that people trust, and when we can partner with them, it\u2019s powerful.\n\nWhy are these racial disparities so difficult to tackle?\n\nBarriers to banking are not new. There\u2019s things that have persisted over time, such as redlining, or how diverse communities have been treated historically. There\u2019s work to be done to erase some of those stigmas. We don\u2019t shy away from that. We acknowledge that those are things that have happened, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re working so hard with our banking inclusion initiative to drive those things out and show that we\u2019re here to provide products and services that can help them financially.",

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations.

            "content": "Wolfe Research has announced its top financial sector stock recommendations for 2025, stressing a selective approach to retail brokers, wealth managers, and alternative investing organizations. Among the companies the company most values are Bank of America (BAC, Financials), Wells Fargo (WFC, Financials), LPL Financial (LPLA, Financials), Robinhood Markets (HOOD, Financials), KKR & Co. (KKR, Financials), and Ares Management (ARES, Financials).\n\nThough they underlined the need of selectivity, Wolfe Research analysts said 2025 might be a reasonably good year for financial companies, especially in the retail brokerage sector. With good trends in interest rates, cash sweep balances, and strong net new asset development, LPL Financial emerged as the firm's recommended choice among recommendations.\n\nReflecting Wolfe's trust in the platform's resiliency and future for expansion in the changing brokerage scene, Robinhood Markets maintained its Outperform rating.\n\nWith analysts noting numerous encouraging elements for outperformance in 2025, Bank of America and Wells Fargo were recognized as good prospects in the money-center banking segment.\n\nKKR and Ares Management ranked first on Wolfe's list of alternatives and wealth management firms. The two companies were positioned as potential leaders by analysts noting the greater strength in these subsectors because of their strategic advantages and strong market presence.\n\nApart from his top choices, Wolfe changed numerous other financial stocks. Improved to Outperform were Carlyle (CG, Financials) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM, Financials). Key factors of this increase in Carlyle's private equity environment and predictions for more buyback activity were noted by analysts as being better conditions. To support its optimistic view, JPMorgan stressed modest net interest income predictions and significant market share increases.\n\nBut Bank of New York Mellon and Lazard suffered downgrades to Peer Perform. Wolfe mentioned valuation issues for Bank of New York Mellon even although she praised the management's strategic initiative implementation. Analysts at Lazard voiced doubt on the company's capacity to stop asset management outflows, a component they see as limiting growth prospects over the next two years.\n\nWolfe's study emphasizes the need of targeted investment strategies to negotiate possible obstacles in 2025 and underlines cautious optimism across several spheres of the financial industry.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

However, the financial sector was performing significantly better, especially when it comes to the big banks. Wells Fargo (WFC 3.49%) was a particular standout, with shares up by as much as 3% on Monday.\n\nA big regulatory move for banks\n\nThere isn't a company-specific reason for the strong performance. Instead, the move is being fueled by the announcement that the Federal Reserve's top banking regulator, Michael Barr, whose official title is vice chair for supervision, is stepping down from his role effective Feb. 28.\n\nBarr had previously said he intended to finish his term, which ends in 2026. He had been leading the charge to raise capital requirements and generally increase banking regulations. There was widespread speculation that President-elect Donald Trump would try to remove Barr after taking office, but now any potential dispute is off the table.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nFor the time being, nothing will happen. And that's generally good news for banks. The Federal Reserve said in the press release announcing Barr's decision that it won't make any major changes to bank regulations until Barr's successor is named.\n\nWhat we don't know is who Trump will appoint to fill the role, but it is likely to be someone far more in favor of bank deregulation. And this could help create a more favorable environment for banks to grow and make money.",

            "content": "Wells Fargo offers four personal checking accounts, and the Prime Checking account is one of only two offering interest. However, the APY on this account is just 0.01% (as of 12/20/24), so to call this \"interest-bearing\" feels like a stretch (even if it is technically correct). Because there's almost no interest to soften the blow of the double-digit monthly fee, we only recommend this account if you have a hefty amount of money to deposit. But if you're loyal to Wells Fargo and interested in digging deeper with the bank, with benefits like relationship rates on loans and savings, fee waivers, and a couple of banking discounts, you're probably the target customer for this account.\n\nAPY 0.01% (as of 12/20/24) depending on account balance Minimum balance for APY $0 Minimum opening deposit requirement $25 Monthly maintenance fees $25 (waived with a combined linked ending account balance of at least $20,000) Overdraft fees $35 on items paid (not charged for items $10 and less, items returned for insufficient funds, or items covered by transfers from a linked savings account, credit card, or line of credit) Number of branches More than 5,600 branches in 36 states and the District of Columbia ATM access 11,000 in-network ATMs\n\nNo charge for using out-of-network ATMs, except for any third-party operator or network fees\n\nReimburses one fee each for domestic and international out-of-network ATM operator fees per fee period Account perks Interest rate discounts on some personal loans\n\nNo fees on incoming wire transfers, money orders, or cashier's checks\n\nAccess to special relationship rates on eligible linked savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) FDIC insured Up to $250,000 per depositor\n\nWho should consider Wells Fargo Prime Checking?\n\nThe Wells Fargo Prime Checking account is best if you like the convenience of going to a brick-and-mortar bank to handle your finances. The bank operates over 5,600 branches in Washington, D.C. and 36 states, and it has a convenient online map and search tool that can help you find out if there are locations near you.\n\nThis account is also a good fit if you make a lot of ATM transactions. Unlike many other banks, Wells Fargo doesn't charge fees whether you use one of its 11,000 in-network ATMs or pick any location that is out of its network. I think this is especially a nice perk if you're someone who travels a lot or just doesn't want to have to spend time searching for a free ATM.\n\nDo not mistake this account as a good option for interest checking. For that, consider SoFi or Axos instead.\n\nWhat we like about Wells Fargo Prime Checking\n\nNo ATM fees\n\nThe most significant benefit of the Wells Fargo Prime Checking account is the lack of ATM fees for transactions made at in-network and out-of-network ATM locations in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nWhile other bank ATM operators might charge you fees when you use an out-of-network machine, Wells Fargo won't. Plus, Wells Fargo will also reimburse fees for one domestic and one international out-of-network ATM transaction per fee period (which is every 25 to 35 days).\n\nRelationship benefits\n\nWells Fargo rewards you with certain relationship benefits when you link other Wells Fargo accounts to your Prime Checking. These perks include special interest rates on linked savings accounts and CDs and interest rate discounts on eligible new personal loans. The bank will also waive its $25 monthly service fee if your eligible linked account balances total at least $20,000.\n\nOverdraft coverage\n\nOverdraft fees are expensive, so it's worth finding ways to avoid them. In many cases, Wells Fargo charges $35 if it pays a transaction when you don't have sufficient funds in your account. There are some exceptions, such as if you resolve the shortage during the extra day grace period provided or the overdrawn amount doesn't exceed $10.\n\nHowever, with Wells Fargo's overdraft protection, you can link a savings account, credit card, or line of credit to cover overdrafts at no charge, which can help you manage your money better.\n\nYou can link up to two Wells Fargo accounts to cover your excessive transactions.\n\nFor example, if there isn't enough money in your linked savings account, the money will be taken from your credit card at no charge. While I always try to keep an eye on my balance to avoid shortages, I like the peace of mind that Wells Fargo's overdraft protection provides.\n\nFee waivers\n\nWith the Wells Fargo Prime Checking account, you can benefit from waivers for common fees that some other accounts charge. You won't pay for personal checks, cashier's checks, money orders, stop payments, or incoming wire transfers. There are also no non-sufficient funds fees for returned items.\n\nWhat Wells Fargo Prime Checking could improve\n\nMonthly maintenance fee\n\nUnless you have $20,000 in your Prime Checking account or across your eligible linked Wells Fargo accounts, you have to pay a $25 monthly maintenance fee. This is a definite drawback because many other checking accounts don't charge monthly fees or have lower ones with more reasonable waiver options. I've managed to avoid these fees with my bank accounts.\n\nBelow-average checking APY\n\nWhile the Wells Fargo Prime Checking account does earn interest, it's minimal. The 0.01% (as of 12/20/24) APY is well below the average checking account interest rate of 0.07% (as of 1/21/25). You would need to keep $2,500 in the account for one year just to earn $25 in interest or to cover one monthly maintenance fee. Some competing accounts offer a much better return with up to a 3.30% APY.\n\nOverdraft charges\n\nIf you don't enroll in overdraft protection or link an account to cover your transactions, Wells Fargo can charge you $35 for any transaction over $10 that it pays. You won't pay more than three of these fees per day, but that could still add up to $105 in overdraft charges. For comparison, many online banks don't charge these fees at all.\n\nForeign transaction fees\n\nThe Wells Fargo Prime Checking account levies a 3% fee when you use your debit card for international purchases where the foreign currency is converted to U.S. dollars. I avoid accounts that charge foreign transaction fees because I travel often. But if you don't plan to use this account for international transactions, this fee is less of an issue.\n\nFeatured Checking Account 5.0 FinanceBuzz writers and editors score products and companies on a number of objective features as well as our expert editorial assessment.

While the various fee waivers, relationship perks, and interest-earning features of the Wells Fargo Prime Checking account may sound attractive, the monthly maintenance fee might not be worth it. If you don't have at least $20,000 across your linked Wells Fargo accounts, the interest you earn won't make up for the required $25 fee you'll pay each month. How do I sign up for a Wells Fargo Prime Checking account? You can sign up for a Wells Fargo Prime Checking account on the bank's website or by scheduling an appointment at a nearby branch. If you are a non-permanent U.S. resident or want to open a joint account, you must apply at a branch rather than online. You can also open the account through the bank's mobile app if you're a current Wells Fargo customer. How can I best avoid fees on my Wells Fargo Prime Checking account? The best way to avoid the $25 monthly maintenance fee on your Prime Checking account is to maintain a balance of $20,000 across your eligible linked accounts. These include checking, savings, CD, IRA, and Wells Fargo Advisors investment accounts. You can avoid overdraft fees with overdraft protection transfers from a linked savings account, credit card, or line of credit.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Wells Fargo Prime Checking account offers notable benefits, particularly if you frequently use ATMs and want to avoid fees for in- and out-of-network transactions. The account's relationship benefits and overdraft protection are also appealing, especially if you have other linked Wells Fargo accounts. However, the $25 monthly maintenance fee makes it less ideal if you can't maintain a $20,000 minimum balance across your linked accounts.\n\nAdditionally, the foreign transaction fees and relatively low interest rates may encourage you to explore other options, mainly if high-interest or fee-free accounts are a priority. Ultimately, this account is most suitable if you value the convenience of Wells Fargo's physical branches and extensive free ATM access.",

He views the shift from \u201cvalue destruction to creation\u201d as a turning point for Citi\u2019s stock.

Meanwhile, the stock is currently trading 20% below its tangible book value, indicating it may be undervalued.

We offer free and paid subscription plans. More info here.\n\nTop local stocks of 2024: CommScope, SPX, Wells Fargo\n\nThe stock market had a big year in 2024, and some local stocks of interest had big gains, too.\n\nIf you hold stocks in your retirement plans, you\u2019re likely to see some healthy gains for the year when you take a look at your year-end statements, because the major stock indexes were all up double digits:\n\nNASDAQ : \u2b06\ufe0f 29%\n\nS&P 500 : \u2b06\ufe0f 23%\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: \u2b06\ufe0f 12%\n\nOf the 22 stocks with local ties tracked by The Ledger, 15 rose in value in 2024 (not including dividends). The biggest gainer on a percentage basis was Catawba County-based CommScope, a provider of communications technology equipment, whose stock rose 85% in 2024. That feat might be made easier to achieve because it started the year at a low price \u2014 $2.82. It rose in the second half of the year thanks to stronger-than-expected earnings and a deal to refinance its debt.\n\nOther big local winners included Charlotte-based industrial manufacturer SPX Corp. (\u2b06\ufe0f 44%) and, lo and behold, Wells Fargo (\u2b06\ufe0f 43%). Wells is based in San Francisco, nominally, but is one of Charlotte\u2019s largest employers, with 27,000 workers here.\n\nThe local stock that dropped the most in 2024 was of Charlotte-based door and window supplier Jeld-Wen (\u2b07\ufe0f 57%), which has suffered from the slower-than-usual housing market. Others with big declines included Charlotte-based clothing retailer Cato Corp. (\u2b07\ufe0f 45%) and Charlotte-based chemical manufacturing company Albemarle Corp. (\u2b07\ufe0f 40%).\n\nHere's The Ledger\u2019s full list of local stocks, with end-of-the-year closing prices and the percentage returns for 2024:\n\nShare\n\nNeed to sign up for this e-newsletter?

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Mortgage Brokerage Services Market Report 2024\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThis Mortgage Brokerage Services market report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market. It traces the market's historic and forecast market growth by geography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mortgage brokerage services market size has grown rapidly in recent years. It will grow from $93.09 billion in 2023 to $102.55 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to interest rate fluctuations, housing market trends, regulatory changes, economic expansion, and shifts in consumer demand.\n\n\n\nThe mortgage brokerage services market size is expected to see rapid growth in the next few years. It will grow to $151.6 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to rising housing demand, increasing urbanization, low-interest rates, government incentives, and growing disposable income. Major trends expected during this period include AI-driven mortgage processing, the use of blockchain for secure transactions, automated underwriting systems, virtual property tours, and advanced data analytics for customer insights.\n\n\n\nThe increasing demand for personalized financial guidance is expected to drive growth in the mortgage brokerage services market. Personalized financial guidance involves creating financial strategies and solutions tailored to an individual's specific financial needs and goals. The rise in personalized financial guidance is influenced by various factors, including interest rates, inflation, economic growth, market complexity, and technological advancements.\n\nMortgage brokerage services serve as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders, offering customized advice based on personal financial situations and long-term objectives. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in April 2024 that employment for personal financial advisors is projected to grow by 13%, from 327,600 in 2022 to 42,000 by 2032, which is significantly faster than the average growth rate for all occupations. Thus, the increasing demand for personalized financial guidance is fueling the growth of the mortgage brokerage services market.\n\n\n\nLeading companies in the mortgage brokerage services market are developing innovative offerings, such as brokerage as a service (BAAS), to enhance their services and meet evolving market needs. Brokerage as a service (BAAS) is a modern solution that allows businesses, particularly in the financial sector, to outsource their brokerage operations. This model provides companies with access to a third-party provider's infrastructure and technology, enabling them to offer brokerage services without managing their own brokerage systems.\n\n\n\nIn April 2023, RESAAS Services Inc., a Canada-based network of real estate professionals, teamed up with Rocket Mortgage Canada to improve the real estate transaction process. This partnership provides real estate agents with access to a streamlined mortgage process, allowing them to quickly pre-qualify clients for optimal mortgage products and competitive rates, thus enhancing the value they offer. Rocket Mortgage Canada is a provider of mortgage brokerage services based in Canada.\n\n\n\nNorth America was the largest region in the mortgage brokerage services market in 2023. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in the mortgage brokerage services market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East, Africa. The countries covered in the mortgage brokerage services market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK, USA, Canada, Italy, Spain.\n\nMortgage Brokerage Services Competitive Landscape and Company Profiles: Overview, Products and Services, Strategy, Financial Performance\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nFederal National Mortgage Association\n\nWells Fargo Bank N.a.\n\nFairway Independent Mortgage Corporation\n\nRocket Mortgage\n\nOther Major and Innovative Mortgage Brokerage Services Companies\n\nHomebridge Financial Services Inc\n\nMr. Cooper Group Inc\n\nPennyMac Financial Services Inc\n\nGuild Mortgage Company\n\nCaliber Home Loans Inc\n\nMovement Mortgage LLC\n\nAmerican Pacific Mortgage Corporation\n\nLendingTree Inc\n\nPrimeLending a PlainsCapital Company\n\nLoan Factory Inc\n\nUnion Home Mortgage Corp\n\nCitiMortgage Inc\n\nMorty Inc\n\na-M-S Mortgage Services Inc\n\nCounsel Mortgage Group LLC\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 175 Forecast Period 2024 - 2028 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $102.55 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2028 $151.6 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 10.3% Regions Covered Global\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

He assumed office on January 3, 1985. His current term ends on January 3, 2027. McConnell (Republican Party) ran for re-election to the U.S. Senate to represent Kentucky. He won in the general election on November 3, 2020. McConnell is the Senate minority leader in the 118th Congress. He became the minority leader when the Democratic Party gained a majority in the Senate in January 2021.McConnell previously served as Senate majority leader from 2015 to 2021. He was unanimously elected as majority leader by Republicans following the 2014 elections. Before that, he served as Senate minority leader from 2007 to 2015. As Senate majority leader, McConnell set records for the number of judicial nominees confirmed during the first two years of a presidency. As of July 2019, the Senate had confirmed two Supreme Court justices, 41 circuit court appeals judges, and 80 district court judges during President Donald Trump's presidency. \u201cTo put that in context, that\u2019s about one in five of the Courts of Appeals judges nationwide have now been appointed by this president and confirmed by this Senate in two and a half years. And I want you to know that my view is, there will be no vacancies left behind. None,\u201d McConnell said in June 2019. McConnell previously worked as the Deputy U.S. Attorney for Legislative Affairs from 1974 to 1975 and as a judge-executive of Jefferson County, KY, from 1979 to 1985.\n\nWells Fargo & Company Company Profile\n\nWells Fargo & Company, a financial services company, provides diversified banking, investment, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance products and services in the United States and internationally.

            "content": "The Newton girls basketball team picked up a non-conference win against Knoxville at Wells Fargo Arena Saturday afternoon, while the Cardinal boys lost a close game to the Panthers.\n\nThe Newton girls led start to finish. The Cardinals lead at the end of the first quarter was 14 to 2. They were up 29 to 6 at the half, and 40 to 12 at the end of the third quarter. The final was Newton 53, Knoxville 17.\n\nNewton Coach Jake Bennett says defensive pressure contributed to the team\u2019s early offensive success.\n\n\u201cOur message going into the game was to try and get off to a fast start. I thought the girls came out with a lot of energy and were able to force some defensive turnovers, which led to offensive possessions right away.\u201d\n\nTori White had 15 points for Newton while Payton Carkhuff and Brooke Garvis each added 8 points.\n\nThe Newton girls are now 6-3 overall.\n\nThe Newton boys lost to Knoxville 48-43. The Cardinals played from behind until Caden Klein hit a three-point shot with 1:43 left in the third quarter, giving Newton a 30-27 lead. The score was tied 32-32 at the start of the fourth quarter. The teams traded the lead until a Knoxville 3-point shot with just over four minutes left gave the Panthers the lead for good at 42-40. The Cardinals missed a three-point shot to tie the game with 17 seconds left, and the Panthers hit two free throws to end the scoring.\n\nNewton Coach Jason Carter said the game came down to making key shots.\n\n\u201cKnoxville is a real solid basketball team with both post presence and good guards. They just made a few more plays than we did down the stretch. They hit a couple of real big shots late in the fourth quarter and we missed ours.\u201d\n\nCade Bauer led Newton with 12 points and Tyler Thompson added 9 points off the bench. The loss drops the Cardinal boys to 4-3 this season. The Newton boys and girls have a Little Hawkeye Conference doubleheader at home Tuesday night against Pella Christian.",

            "content": "The Flyers, however, have only managed to play at \"hockey .500\" in this span, going 8-8-2 in their last 18 games and 9-9-2 in the last 20. The goaltending has struggled, 5-on-5 team defense has been inconsistent and a penalty kill that was in the NHL's top three at Thanksgiving has swooned over the last five weeks.\n\nNevertheless, strictly from an offensive standpoint, the Flyers have trended in a positive direction. Now they need more game-to-game defensive consistency and, above all, more reliable goaltending.\n\n2. Between the pipes\n\nSamuel Ersson (lower-body injury) did not practice on Saturday. Officially day-to-day, he is not likely to be available for Sunday's game. Rookie goalie Aleksei Kolosov (4-8-1, 3.45 goals against average, .870 save percentage) and Ivan Fedotov (4-4-1, 3.48 GAA, .877 SV%) are available for duty.\n\nKolosov, who celebrated his 23rd birthday on Saturday, has struggled in each of his last four starts. His strongest performance of the season came against the Detroit Red Wings on Dec. 12 as Kolosov flirted with his first NHL shutout for two-plus periods on his way to stopping 25 of 26 shots.\n\nFedotov is now one month removed from his last game action. He played the first period of the Flyers' 7-5 home loss to the Florida Panthers on December 5. With Ersson dealing with a recurring lower-body issue, Fedotov has dressed as the backup goaltender this week.\n\nToronto goaltender Joseph Woll was in net for the wins over the Islanders (32 saves on 33 shots) and Bruins (27 saves on 31 shots). With Sunday's game being the latter half of a back-to-back, gargantuan goalie Dennis Hildeby (6-foot-7, 225 pounds) could get the start.\n\nFormer Flyers netminder Anthony Stolarz remains sidelined for Toronto while dealing with a knee injury that required surgery. His projected return will be in late February.\n\n3. Flyers special teams\n\nPhiladelphia's long-suffering power play showed signs of hope over the last two games. After enduring an 0-for-17 drought, the Flyers connected for a pair of goals (excluding a tally that was washed out on a coach's challenge for an offside entry 15 seconds before the would-be goal).\n\nEntering Sunday's game, the Flyers power play ranks 28th in the NHL at 15.9 percent efficiency. Toronto's penalty kill ranks 10th leaguewide at 82.3 percent.\n\nAt Thanksgiving, the Flyers penalty kill ranked third in the NHL at 85.7 percent success. Unfortunately, since then, the PK has sputtered at 63.9 percent (31st in the NHL over that span). Overall, the PK is 19th in the NHL this season at 78.3 percent. By comparison, Toronto's power play ranks 18th at 20.7 percent efficiency.\n\n4. Homecomings for Drydale and Frost\n\nLeaguewide, it's always special for players who hail from the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to play a game in Toronto. In the Flyers' case, both defenseman Jamie Drysdale and center Frost are local products.\n\nDysdale, born and raised in the Yonge and Lawrence neighborhood of Toronto, will play his second career NHL game as a Flyer against the Maple Leafs.\n\nFrost grew up in the Toronto suburb of Aurora, Ontario. His father Andy, a famed classic rock radio DJ, was also the longtime public address announcer for the Maple Leafs. As such, Morgan spent considerable time as a youngster in and around Scotiabank Arena when the building was called the Air Canada Centre.\n\nFlyers winger Tippett hails from Peterborough, Ontario, which is located roughly 85 miles northeast of Toronto. Peterborough is not considered to be part of the Greater Toronto Area. However, Tippett grew up rooting for the Leafs and his favorite player was Phil Kessel.\n\n5. Behind Enemy Lines: Matthews and Marner\n\nMaple Leafs start center Auston Matthews returned from a six-game absence (upper-body injury) in Saturday's game. He scored a goal and contributed a pair of assists in the 6-4 win over the Bruins. Overall this season, Matthews has played 25 games and compiled 26 points (12g, 14a).\n\nMitch Marner had a five-point explosion (one goal, four assists) against Boston. For the season, he leads the Maple Leafs with 56 points (14g, 42a).",

Now, anyone can buy the tools to con you for a few bucks on the Dark Web.\n\nThere are even guides to make a phone number look like it's from your bank, including phony customer service reps to answer all your questions.\n\nPro scammers rely on social engineering, too. That's the fancy name for mind games to gain your trust. The folks are experts at exploiting fear, urgency and trust.\n\nWhen someone says your account is at risk, your brain shifts into panic mode, making it harder to think critically.\n\nBank scams are skyrocketing in the US. People lost their life savings; one Virginia woman had a whopping $700,000 wired out of her Wells Fargo account, and another in Los Angeles lost $100,000 in minutes\n\nThese fraudsters are skilled at creating scenarios that seem believable, like referencing recent transactions or sharing bits of accurate personal information.\n\nThey also use pressure tactics, insisting you act immediately to 'save' your money.\n\nVideo calls are another common method of distraction and pressure. Seeing a face makes you more trusting.\n\nA nasty bonus: If they keep you occupied, you're more likely to ignore the security alerts warning you to stop.\n\nThe best thing you can do is pause. Take a moment to evaluate the situation before reacting. More on that below.\n\nThe big banks lost interest\n\nLast year, banks reimbursed scam victims at pitiful rates.\n\nJPMorgan Chase reimbursed two percent of transactions disputed as scams, while Wells Fargo reimbursed four percent of scam claims.\n\nBank of America, meanwhile, reimbursed 24 percent of its scam dispute transactions.\n\nFederal law requires banks to reimburse you only under certain circumstances, like if someone steals your phone and accesses your account.\n\nBut if you're the one to sign a wire form or agree to an online transfer and you find out it's a scam, you're screwed.\n\nAbout Kim Komando National Radio Hall of Famer, Host on 510+ stations, Podcaster & Tech Expert.

Take steps to make sure you're not one of them.\n\n\u25cf Slow down: If a caller claims to be from your bank or asks for your account details, hang up. Call the bank yourself. Do not Google your bank's number; find it on their official website or the back of your card.\n\n\u25cf Beware of transfer scams: Never send money via wire transfer, crypto or gift cards in response to unsolicited calls or emails. Your bank or the government will never ask you to transfer funds to a 'safe' account.\n\n\u25cf Don't follow links: If you're told to visit a website, download an app or click a link, it's a phishing site or malware installation.\n\n\u25cf Use a virtual phone number: I bet your real one has been leaked in a couple of data breaches this year. Use a virtual number tied to your finances scammers don't know.\n\n\u25cf Review your transaction history often: The sooner you catch fraudulent activity, the better your chances of resolving it.\n\n\u25cf Set up alerts: In your banking app, you can turn on alerts for transactions over a certain amount or made in a foreign country, as well as notifications about suspicious activity like attempted logins from a new browser.Some banks let you set transaction limits on withdrawals or purchases, too.\n\n\u25cf Educate yourself and loved ones: Keep up to date with scammers' tricks so you can spot them. Share these tips with family and friends, especially older adults. Awareness is the best defense.\n\nIt's not just bogus calls and emails\n\nCybercriminals have a host of tricks at their disposal to fool you out of your money and personal info.\n\nFake banking apps\n\nScammers create counterfeit versions of popular banking apps, complete with realistic logos and interfaces. You download it thinking it's the real version. Once you log in, they steal your credentials. Always download apps directly from your bank's official website or the app store. If there are a suspiciously low number of downloads or reviews, move on.\n\nPhony bank emails with verified logos\n\nAI tools make it a breeze to create convincing emails with verified sender logos and signatures. These emails may even mimic your bank's official communications. If you're ever unsure, don't click. Log in directly through your bank's website or call the number on the back of your card.\n\nOne-time passcode theft\n\nScammers trick you into sharing a legitimate one-time passcode sent to your phone. Remember, your bank will never ask you for these codes. If you receive one unexpectedly, it may mean someone is trying to access your account.\n\nSocial media 'banking representatives'\n\nFraudsters posing as bank reps on social media platforms lure victims in with fake customer service help. This often comes after posting a public complaint. Never share account details over social media or direct messages. Banks handle issues through official channels only.\n\nQR code scams\n\nJust because it's in your bank's parking lot or near their signage, doesn't mean it's real. Scanning random QR codes is just as dangerous as going to a random URL. Don't do it.",

            "content": "The two biggest global network payment processors are Visa and Mastercard. A recent severe setback for both publicly traded corporations came when an American judge ordered them to reimburse cardholders a staggering $197 million. Based on the information that is currently accessible, an American court ordered VISA and Mastercard to reimburse the money that was taken out of their users\u2019 and customers\u2019 cards earlier this year under the guise of higher fees.\n\nVisa and Mastercard users will receive a $1,797 direct payment soon\n\nIn its ruling, the US court declared the extra fees that the two businesses were collecting from their customers unlawful. According to sources, as part of the settlement, Mastercard will return $92.8 million to cardholders, while Visa will pay $104.6 million to its customers. When using a Visa or Mastercard to withdraw cash from an ATM in the United States, additional fees must be paid. According to the court\u2019s verdict, the additional fee was unlawful, and Visa and Mastercard were forced to reimburse the money.\n\nIn the $197 million settlement, customers who have taken out cash from bank-run ATMs since 2007 are involved. It is important to note that not every Mastercard and Visa user will receive a refund. The two conditions for a refund are:\n\nBetween October 1, 2007, and July 26, 2024, cardholders who used a Visa or Mastercard debit card at an ATM in the United States paid a non-refundable surcharge.\n\nBanks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, or Bank of America that are part of the VISA or Mastercard ATM network are required to levy fees.\n\nAccording to the information provided, Visa charges the card issuer either based on the volume of the card or each transaction. However, Mastercard charges card-issuing institutions according to the percentage of global dollar volume, which is the total volume of all card transactions over a given period.\n\nWhich steps should users follow to request claims regarding their payments?\n\nTo request the reimbursement, beneficiaries should go to the official class action website, fill out the online form, or download it and submit it to ATM Surcharge Settlement. Provide your contact information and sign an oath indicating that you paid excessive surcharges, as this document is legally enforceable and must be accurate. Even if you don\u2019t have to provide any papers right away, the claims administrator can ask you for more proof later on.\n\nFinally, consumers who wish to receive the Visa and Mastercard settlement payment should be aware of a few crucial dates. First, January 22nd was designated as the claim filing deadline, and January 24th was the day of the final hearing to finalize the settlement. Remember that you must complete the application by the deadline to ensure your participation in the refund.\n\nThe US has accused Visa of debit card monopoly\n\nVisa is being sued in the US for allegedly illegally suppressing competition to keep a monopoly on the debit card market. Visa was accused of penalizing businesses that attempted to utilize other payment networks and bribing possible rivals to maintain its market dominance. According to the Department of Justice, the actions have hindered innovation and resulted in hefty extra costs for American companies and consumers. The action against Visa is the most recent one brought by the Biden administration, which has addressed monopolistic issues\u2014known as antitrust in the US\u2014more forcefully than other administrations.\n\nIn other regions of the world, such as Europe and Australia, the company\u2019s activities have also been the subject of lawsuits and investigations from competition authorities and merchants. The complaint claims that the business processes over 60% of debit transactions in the US and generates $7 billion in fees yearly. In terms of revenue, its debit card division outperformed its credit card division in 2022 and was very lucrative.",

            "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Wells Fargo (WFC) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis biggest U.S. mortgage lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $20.5 billion, up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.91% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

            "content": "Wells Fargo (WFC) analysts have expressed strong optimism about Citigroup Inc. (C), predicting that the bank\u2019s stock could potentially double in value over the next three years. This bullish outlook is based on anticipated profit surges, moderated expenses, and the successful implementation of what has been described as the \u201cmost significant\u201d reorganization in the bank\u2019s history. The reorganization, led by CEO Jane Fraser since she took over in 2021, aims to enhance management accountability and simplify the bank\u2019s operations, moving from a complex global matrix structure to a more streamlined five lines of business.\n\nThe analysts at Wells Fargo have elevated their price target for Citigroup from $95 to $110, maintaining an \u201coverweight\u201d rating. This adjustment reflects their confidence in Citigroup\u2019s strategic direction and operational improvements. Following this endorsement, Citigroup\u2019s shares saw an increase, peaking at a 1.6% rise to $71.09, indicating investor enthusiasm for the bank\u2019s future prospects.\n\nMike Mayo, a well-known analyst at Wells Fargo, has highlighted the underappreciated aspect of improved management accountability post-reorganization, suggesting that this could significantly contribute to the bank\u2019s profitability. His perspective underscores a pivotal shift for Citigroup, marking 2024 as a transitional year leading to an efficiency inflection point.\n\nAdditionally, KBW analysts have also shown increased confidence in Citigroup, raising their price target from $82 to $85 and naming it one of their \u201ctop ideas\u201d for 2025. They point to an uptick in capital markets activity and Citigroup\u2019s undervalued status compared to its peers as key factors. Citigroup\u2019s price-to-book ratio stands at 0.69, significantly lower than competitors like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) at 2.08 and Bank of America (BAC) at 1.24, suggesting that the stock might be undervalued.\n\nThis optimism comes at a crucial time as Citigroup is set to release its earnings in mid-January, where the focus will be on how the bank plans to grow its key businesses in 2025. The transition from value destruction to value creation, as highlighted by Mayo, is seen as a major catalyst for sustained stock price growth.\n\nOverall, the consensus among analysts is that Citigroup is poised for a significant turnaround, driven by strategic restructuring, cost management, and an underappreciated market position. This could make Citigroup not just a recovery story but a standout performer among large-cap banks, provided the economic scenario remains favorable.\n\nPrice Action: Citi shares are currently trading at $70.34, marking a $0.40 or 0.57% increase in midday trading. The stock has seen a strong year-over-year gain of nearly 30%, indicating positive investor sentiment towards the company\u2019s prospects. With a 52-week low of $50.51 and a 52-week high of $73.38, the current price falls within the range of Citi\u2019s recent trading history.",

Despite still being a rarity in the banking industry, staffers at Wells Fargo are hoping to buck that trend one branch \u2014 or nonbranch \u2014 at a time.\n\nData released earlier this year by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the union membership rate in the public sector (e.g. local government) was roughly 33% for 2023, more than five times higher than the 6% rate in the private sector (e.g. transportation and utilities).\n\nFinance had the lowest rate of the private sector at 1.2%, and between 2022 and 2023 there was a drop in the number of employees that both belong to a union or whose positions were covered by a union or employee association contract.\n\nRead more: Starbucks union authorizes strike ahead of final bargaining\n\nBut within that 1.2%, employees have been able to organize their workplaces and in doing so, work towards addressing issues like stagnating wages and benefit packages out of sync with modern needs .\n\nEmployees of the $1.9 billion-asset Beneficial State Bank in Oakland, California were one of the first to break the trend in 2020, when 113 employees voted to join the Communication Workers of America. The group included tellers, custodians, loan underwriters and relationship bankers.\n\n\"Whether that's through a union or another mechanism, giving employees a structured way to express their needs and concerns can lead to more informed and effective management decisions,\" said Randell Leach , CEO of Beneficial State Bank.\n\nSince then, others such as the $42 million Genesee Co-Op Federal Credit Union in Rochester, New York, and the $14 billion-asset Lake Michigan Credit Union in Caledonia, Michigan, have followed in Beneficial's footsteps with unions of their own.\n\nRead more: 15 steps in the unionization of banks, credit unions\n\nSean Higgins, a research fellow for the nonprofit think-tank Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in a prior opinion article for American Banker that the \"original defense against union organizing efforts pioneered by automobile magnate Henry Ford in the 1920s\" has yet to be improved on.\n\n\"Ford's tactics were: Pay your employees well (at least the industry standard, if not higher); provide them with good benefits and a safe work environment and keep an ear open for any concerns they might have,\" Higgins said. \"Do those things and it is unlikely workers will see any need for a union.\"\n\nRead on to see how Wells Fargo employees have progressed since unionizing the first branch in late 2023, and what organized employees predict for the future.\n\nA Wells Fargo branch in Bethel, Alaska.

The CWA rescinded its objection to the challenge, as leaders felt that the group supporting the effort was still greater than those objecting by a considerable margin.\n\nThose who voted work in Wells' conduct management intake team and are tasked with reviewing customer and employee complaints. Despite laying off nine of the team's more than 40 employees, the bank maintained that the decisions were not related to labor activities.\n\n\"We regularly review and adjust staffing levels to align with market conditions and the needs of our businesses.

Members of the NZBA commit to transitioning operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their financing activities to align with net zero pathways by 2050, and to set 2030 financed emissions targets, initially focused on key emissions intensive sectors.\n\nThe NZBA forms part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a UN-backed umbrella group of net zero-focused financial sector coalitions, which also includes the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance (NZFSPA), the Net Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI), the Paris Aligned Asset Owners (PAAO), the Venture Climate Alliance (VCA), and the Net-Zero Export Credit Agencies Alliance (NZECA).\n\nAfter rapid expansion in the early years of the decade, members of the various GFANZ groups have come under significant pressure, particularly from Republican politicians in the U.S., who have been warning financial institutions including banks, insurers, asset owners and investors of potential legal violations from their participation in climate-focused alliances and of plans to exclude the companies from state business, as part of a broader anti-ESG political campaign.\n\nSeveral of the groups have seen high-profile departures over the past several months, with one of the coalitions, the Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), even disbanding in 2024 following a string of exits.\n\nCiti announced a commitment in early 2021, on the first day of Jane Fraser\u2019s tenure as CEO, to a 2050 net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) financing target, and the bank has followed up with interim targets for financed emissions reductions for key emissions-intensive sectors, such as energy and power. In a statement published announcing its decision to leave the group, Citi reiterated its commitment to reach net zero, and pledged to support GFANZ in its new focus on \u201cmobilizing capital to emerging markets in support of the low-carbon transition.\u201d Citi stated:\n\n\u201cIn light of this shift, and Citi\u2019s progress towards its own net zero goals, we have decided to leave the Net Zero Banking Alliance and focus our attention on supporting GFANZ during this new phase.\u201d\n\nBank of America\u2019s net zero finance goal also dates to early 2021, and the bank has also set a series of financed emissions reduction targets for key sectors. In a publication in late September 2024, the bank reiterated its goal to achieve net zero in its financing, operations and supply chain by 2050, and set new financed emissions targets for the Iron & Steel and Maritime Shipping sectors.\n\nIn a statement provided to ESG Today confirming the firm\u2019s departure from the NZBA, a Bank of America spokesperson said:\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with clients on this issue and meet their needs.\u201d\n\nBoth Citi and Bank of America remain as members of the GFANZ Principals Group, which sets the strategic direction and priorities for GFANZ, and monitors progress.",

Although the interest rate you receive will vary depending on your business\u2019s creditworthiness and other factors, rates on this unsecured business line of credit can range from the prime rate plus 1.75% to the prime rate plus 9.75%.\n\nTop SBA lender\n\n[0] U.S. Small Business Administration .

St. Edmond and South Hamilton agreed to move their originally-scheduled twinbill back in November.\n\nThe St. Edmond boys are off to a perfect 5-0 start, while the Hawks (0-7) are looking for their first win of the year. The Gaels have reeled off four consecutive victories by double digits, led by junior Hunter Horn\u2019s 24-point, 12.4-rebound average.\n\nClassmates Jakob Koopman (11 points, 8 rebounds) and Jack McElroy (7.2 points, 5.8 assists) have also been steady contributors for St. Edmond.\n\nKochendorfer received some good news over break as well. Top reserve Carson Bargfrede, also a junior, did not suffer any structural, cartilage or ligament damage in a left leg injury against Hampton-Dumont/CAL to close the 2024 portion of the campaign. Bargfrede will still miss a few weeks as he recovers and works his way back into shape.\n\nSouth Hamilton, which graduated all five of its starters from a year ago, has been led by freshman post player Benjamin Swanson (10.5 points, 5.0 rebounds) and junior Sam Koehnk (8.6 points, 3.6 rebounds).\n\nThe Gael girls are 1-5 so far, but three of their losses have been by 12 or fewer points.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Wells Fargo & Co's (NYSE:WFC) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-02, Wells Fargo & Co's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $55.51. It's currently trading at a price of $70.24. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -26.54%. The company is fair valued.\n\nThe Art of Valuation: Discovering Wells Fargo & Co's Intrinsic Value\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Wells Fargo & Co's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $4.81 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.54%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = -2.40% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 25.36 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 9.45 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 55.51\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $107.06. This valuation indicates that the Wells Fargo & Co is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 34.39%.

            "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Wells Fargo (WFC), which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis biggest U.S. mortgage lender has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 12.20%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Wells Fargo was expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share, but it reported $1.52 per share instead, representing a surprise of 19.69%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.27 per share, while it actually produced $1.33 per share, a surprise of 4.72%.\n\nFor Wells Fargo, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nWells Fargo currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.23%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.",

Between preparations for New Year\u2019s Eve, planning for the new year, are banks open on these dates? If you need to make any changes or transactions, whether it\u2019s withdrawing cash or simply making sure everything is in order before the start of the year, it is necessary to know what the bank hours are for these dates. So, we are going to tell you everything you need to know so you can plan everything better and enjoy a great start to the year!\n\nWhat happens to banks on December 31st and January 1st?\n\nYou have to keep in mind that on December 31st a lot of people go out to celebrate the new year with their families, and that January 1st is one of the 11 federal holidays in the United States, so public institutions and government offices will remain closed to celebrate the holiday. But what about banks? On the last day of the year, December 31st, banks will operate on regular business hours, but many branches will close earlier than usual, so operations will most likely end around 4:00 PM (local time).\n\nFor New Year\u2019s Day, as we said, most banks will close their doors, as will Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi and many others, so keep in mind that if you need to make urgent transactions you will not have access to the branches.\n\nAnd what do I do if I\u2019m in a hurry?\n\nFortunately, we live in the age of technology, and although banks are not offering in-person service, banking services do not stop during holidays, so ATMs and mobile banking applications will be fully operational, so you will be able to carry out any transaction that you normally do (transfers, bill payments and balance inquiries).\n\nWhen will things go back to normal?\n\nThe next day, remember that this closure is only for national holidays, so on January 2, all branches will be operational as every other day.\n\nWhat other days are federal holidays in the USA?\n\nBelow, we are going to leave you the list of national holidays, in which government offices, banks, and most businesses will close their doors:\n\nNew Year: January 1.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day: Third Monday in January.\n\nPresidents\u2019 Day (or Washington Day): Third Monday in February.\n\nMemorial Day: Last Monday in May.\n\nIndependence Day: July 4.\n\nLabor Day: First Monday in September.\n\nColumbus Day (or Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day): Second Monday in October.\n\nVeterans Day: November 11.\n\nThanksgiving Day: Fourth Thursday in November.\n\nChristmas: December 25.\n\nPlease note that if the holiday falls on a Saturday, it will be moved to the previous Friday, and if it falls on a Sunday, it will most likely be moved to the following Monday.\n\nAny tips for planning?\n\nTo avoid any inconvenience during these festive days, it is best to anticipate the closings. So, if you need to withdraw cash or make some specific transactions, you can do so on December 31st or days before. Take advantage of digital banking as well because it is a way to always have your bank with you and be able to make the necessary transactions when necessary. Finally, check the hours of your branch because although most banks close earlier on New Year\u2019s Eve, some branches may have different hours.\n\nRemember that New Year is New Year for everyone, and we all like to enjoy this day with our family. So, if you are in a hurry to make a transaction, do it earlier and anticipate this closing!\n\nLife returns to normal on January 2nd. Have a Happy New Year!",

In an Oct. 24 order, Judge Hunter Carroll in Sarasota County\u2019s 12th Judicial Circuit Court confirmed agreement with ABC\u2019s principal Dave Balot\u2019s assertion stating there is no need for a comprehensive plan amendment to proceed with his mega-hotel project.\n\n\u201cThe court issued an order that the County process the plaintiff\u2019s site and development permit,\u201d Moye said on Nov. 19. \u201cUnless otherwise directed by the board today, our office will not seek an appeal of that court\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nOn March 27, Balot filed a declaratory judgment asking Sarasota County courts to confirm that his hotel special exception can move forward, assuming he adheres to his approved, binding development plan. For his plan to proceed, the County must approve Balot\u2019s site development plan application, which they neglected to do, claiming the special exception was no longer valid due to the court rulings on two other hotel projects. The purpose of Balot\u2019s filing was for the court to issue a ruling stating his plans for the project are \u201cfinal, non-appealable and binding\u201d for his special exception on use and height, considering no challenge and a previously impending two-year deadline of Oct. 24, 2024.\n\nBalot\u2019s exception was the third in a series of special exception approvals for high-density hotels granted in 2021 and 2022. The two previously granted special exceptions allowed for transient accommodations and increased heights above the existing 35-foot limit established in 1989, but an August 2023 legal ruling on lawsuits that named only the two other hotels removed their special exceptions. Both those hotels \u2013 one with seven stories at Old Stickney Point Road and one with eight stories at Calle Miramar \u2013 were approved under the County\u2019s short-lived \u201cunlimited density\u201d decision in 2021.\n\nWhen Balot\u2019s project was presented to the Sarasota Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) in October 2022, it was unanimously approved and was not legally challenged. Subsequently, in November 2023, the county commissioners chose to further study and vet a comprehensive plan amendment recommendation that would allow the hotels to advance. The previous go-ahead was provided by the County based on its interpretation of the existing rules. Now, Balot\u2019s project was the only one excluded.\n\nDuring public comments on the matter at the start of the Nov. 19 meeting, Lourdes Ramirez, a Siesta Key resident and neighborhood advocate who has been the driving force behind successful lawsuits fighting development, said she acknowledges that challenging the ruling would be limited to anything that is a \u201cmaterial change\u201d to the approved hotel plan. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we can challenge what everyone, including the developer, admitted in court, against the density and intensity that clearly violates the comprehensive plan,\u201d she said. She further added that, in the county attorney\u2019s memo about the project for the commission, she was named as the individual who will be closely monitoring the project\u2019s process. \u201cSo, I want to return the favor and volley this responsibility back to the County,\u201d she said, followed by her recommendation that the special exception be revoked as it \u201cwas issued in error.\u201d\n\nDistrict 2 Commissioner Mark Smith, a Siesta Key resident and architect whose district includes the south end of the key, said at the Nov. 19 meeting, \u201cI believe that we should appeal.\u201d He said the decision made by the board at that time was based on the assumption that the County was in the right. \u201cI\u2019m not against hotels on Siesta Key,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have something that is in violation of our comp plan if we let this go forward, and I think that\u2019s just not the thing to do. I believe there is judicial precedent that Sarasota County could go back and say, \u2018We rescind the special exceptions.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoye said an appeal would require at least three commissioners\u2019 votes. He continued to say that, at the time, there was a unified development code (UDC) amendment adopted which was under challenge but hadn\u2019t been deemed inconsistent with the comprehensive plan yet, so when the special exception for Balot\u2019s hotel came in, the UDC amendment still held. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know that the argument is that it is illegal, or that it was a mistake or done in error.\u201d he said. \u201cI think at that time it was, but what we tried to get across to the judge was that the granting of this site and development permit is an additional development order that\u2019s inconsistent with the comprehensive plan.\u201d Moye said the judge previously focused more on the special exception than the plan amendment issue, so an appeal could still happen, but it would likely be difficult to achieve.\n\nCommissioner Mast pointed out it has a binding development concept plan. \u201cAnd so, if it were to move forward and be approved, it is under what I would call rather tight scrutiny, as to nothing can be altered, changed, in any way, shape or form from that binding development concept plan, is that correct?\u201d Moye confirmed that was the case, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nCutsinger agreed with Mast, regarding the steadfastness of the binding development concept plan, saying, \u201cI think it would be really difficult to go back and win an appeal on this.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Cutsinger made a motion for \u201cno action,\u201d so as not to allow for an appeal. The motion passed 4-1 with Commissioner Smith voting \u201cnay.\u201d\n\nIn other matters, Moye asked for a vote regarding a settlement with Siesta Beach Lots LLC, the resolution of a federal suit filed in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, with multiple allegations, seeking compensation under the Fifth Amendment for property takings, specifically, contesting public use of a beach access maintained by the plaintiff. The LLC\u2019s principal is Siesta Key hotelier Michael Holderness. The County filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, however, the court ordered mediation, which led to a settlement agreement.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the County encouraged public use of the private property and prohibited the construction of barriers such as fences, bollards and \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs in the publicly used, private land.\n\nThe settlement includes an exchange of parcels in the Mira Mar Beach subdivision, adjacent to Beach Access #3. Additionally, the LLC will likely seek a coastal setback variance to possibly develop a portion of the land, and the county will construct a memorial kiosk at access #3.\n\n\u201cMy goal has always been to make more private beach property public,\u201d Holderness told Siesta Sand. \u201cHaving safe, regulated beaches with legal access is key. Together with the County, I think we have done just that.\u201d",

            "content": "Whether in blog comments, emails, our Facebook group, or our monthly Ask Us Anything (this month\u2019s edition is pushed out to next week because of the holiday today), readers often ask us what we think will happen. For many years, we\u2019ve given our educated guesses \u2014 both in response to individual questions like those and also by making a series of bigger-picture annual predictions about what we think might be coming in the world of miles, points, and credit cards.\n\nI think it is fairly well-established that Frequent Miler does a pretty good job of dissecting and analyzing loyalty programs and credit cards, including both existing programs as they are and as they change. Unfortunately, thanks to old posts existing in perpetuity, it is equally well-established that we are far better at analyzing and dissecting those things that have happened than we are at guessing what will happen.\n\nHowever, never willing to settle and rest on our laurels, we nonetheless soldier on with annual predictions that mostly don\u2019t come true (sometimes with almost comical speed). To that end, I present you with Frequent Miler\u2019s 2025 predictions, broken down by team member.\n\nNick Predicts\u2026.\n\nAmerican will go off the charts\n\nI hate to jinx us, so I\u2019m not going to predict a devaluation. And I really don\u2019t want to predict that American will jettison what remains to be a very strong partner award chart. However, I\u2019m not optimistic. With the winds of change blowing award chart-less awards to so many other programs, I feel like 2025 is the year that American will leave its partner award chart behind. I very sincerely hope that I\u2019m wrong, but I predict that American\u2019s partner awards will no longer be subject to an award chart at some point in 2025 and that awards will likely be dynamically-priced when that happens.\n\nWe\u2019ll see a cruise match that takes us to uncharted waters\n\nI\u2019ve written extensively about \u201cfree\u201d (or very deeply discounted) cruise opportunities over the past couple of years. Many of those have run ashore over the past few months, but I\u2019ll predict that something new will come along in 2025 on the cruise match front that will create an opportunity to cruise \u201cfor free\u201d on a new line or on an itinerary that is in some way different than the ones we\u2019ve seen so far. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be, but I\u2019m willing to bet that the community will drum up something new in 2025.\n\nFlying Blue will make stopovers bookable online\n\nFlying Blue added stopovers on award tickets a couple of years ago. That sounds great in theory, but knowing when one should be available and what it would cost has been an enigma for all but the most advanced award bookers given the loose handle most of us have on the stopover rules. But Air France KLM Flying Blue has shown an almost Aeroplan-like desire to make its frequent flyer program interesting and appealing to savvy US-based consumers. I\u2019ll bet that 2025 is the year that we see Flying Blue bring this functionality online, making the program even more appealing to those of us who will learn how to use them.\n\nBarclays will bring back a transferable points card\n\nWhile Hyatt may be the biggest loser of 2024 in the way that Hilton ate their lunch on the SLH takeaway/integration, Barclays gets a seat at the biggest loser of 2024 table given that we\u2019ve found out that Barclays is losing the Hawaiian cards and the American Airlines Aviator cards. In a call with investors, Barclays mentioned pivoting away from airline cards. Unless they intend to pivot away from mainstream rewards cards entirely, I have to imagine that they need to launch a new transferable points card in 2025. They\u2019ve got the infrastructure in place \u2014 to my knowledge, they\u2019ve continued to service the Arrival Premier card (which features transfer partners). Whether they call it an Arrival card or they create something else entirely, Barclays has to do something, if for nothing else than to have a chance at keeping some slice of the customers they stand to lose.\n\nWells Fargo will add a bunch of transfer partners\n\nWells Fargo was surprisingly quiet in 2024. After launching its Autograph Journey card in April 2024 with a limited set of transfer partners, many of us expected that we\u2019d see Wells Fargo quickly add transfer partners to the mix. In fact, I might have thought that part of the reason for their partnership with Bilt could have been to gather insights with an eye toward a robust home-grown program. However, despite having a couple of cards with strong earning potential, their stable of transfer partners remains surprisingly small. I predict that 2025 has to be a breakout year for Wells Fargo adding at least 4 more transfer partners or else they run the risk of being like that Barclays card that you forgot existed until you read the previous paragraph.\n\nBonus prediction (not for any points): Frequent Miler will be better than ever\n\nI\u2019m not looking to earn any points (or bonus points) with this prediction, but I\u2019m going to go on record and say that 2025 will be the best year ever for Frequent Miler. I don\u2019t mean \u201cbest\u201d in terms of measurable, numerical values, but rather \u201cbest\u201d in terms of making the site, content, and each of our major channels better. With Carrie joining Greg, Tim, and I full-time and Stephen doubling his hours, I feel really good about what we\u2019ll be able to do in 2025. That\u2019s not to say that we\u2019ll have a flawless year, but rather just to say that I feel really good about the team we have in place and the expanded time we\u2019ll have to get us where we\u2019re going. Here\u2019s to a great new year!\n\nTim foretells\u2026..\n\nCiti will go \u201cStrataspheric\u201d with a new premium card\n\nI\u2019ve been predicting that Citi would launch a new premium card for three years and I don\u2019t see any reason to stop now. After all, even a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\nCiti is still the all-time Elvis, or king if you will, of premium credit cards because of the original Citi Prestige. That card\u2019s benefits were insanity\u2026as in, how did gainfully employed and supposedly sane people meet together and decide to let it fly. It had a $250 airline credit good for airfare as well as incidentals, a 4th night free benefit that was on any hotel booking when you used a Citi Concierge, Admiral\u2019s Club access regardless of whether or not you were flying American, the ability to redeem ThankYou points at 1.6cpp towards AA flights (for flights still earned AAdvantage miles), three complimentary rounds of golf/year\u2026it was a points and miles junky\u2019s fever dream. Alas, it turned out that the answer to \u201cwhat crazy thing did Citi do\u201d was to design the original Prestige card in the first place and benefits were slowly stripped away. Evidently, Citi lost their shorts on the card (can\u2019t imagine why) and have been hesitant to jump back into the blingy deep end with Chase, Amex and Capital One ever since.\n\nBut that\u2019s finally going to change this year. Citi has a trademark on the Strata Elite card, is supposedly investing in Strata-branded airport lounges and is spending a cool billion dollars to wrest AA away from Barclays. You\u2019re telling me it\u2019s doing all that just to get people to sign up for AA cards and the $95 Strata Premier? Citi ain\u2019t that crazy.\n\nCiti will announce that AA is becoming a transfer partner\n\nSpeaking of the Citi/AA/Barclays menage a trois, that\u2019s finally ending in 2026 after Citi gave AA a billion reasons why there was an AAdvantage to exclusivity. I can\u2019t image that all that effort was just to be able to get their hot little hands on the rights to the Aviator Red card. This is the year that Citi gets serious about competing with the big boys for the loyalties of the credit card abusing using public (see above) that\u2019s willing to spend $500+ per year on a card that makes them feel special.\n\nLet me be clear, I\u2019m NOT predicting that you\u2019ll be able to transfer your ThankYou points to AA in 2025. The exclusive relationship doesn\u2019t start until 2026 and I don\u2019t think that Citi will transfer to AA until that happens. However, I DO think that we\u2019ll know for certain it will be happening by the end of 2025\u2026and don\u2019t look now, but when it does, ThankYou points may become the single most valuable transferable currency.\n\nAA will finally devalue its partner awards\n\nThere\u2019s three certainties in life: death, taxes and the eventual devaluation of AA\u2019s partner award chart. Pretty much every person with a keyboard and a passing interest in points and miles has been predicting it for years.\n\nAmerican long ago went full-tilt dynamic with award flights on its own metal \u2013 some of them can reach almost Delta-ish prices. Curiously, they\u2019ve not tinkered with their partner award chart, however, where there is still fixed pricing as long as the partner has released saver award space. As a result, there are still quite a few sweet spots that can be had with partners, something we saw emphasized during the recent \u201cMillion Mile Madness\u201d challenge when both Nick and Greg made good use of a couple of them.\n\nThe music\u2019s going to stop in 2025, however. American will use the move to Citi as the perfect opportunity to \u201ccontinue to explore how to create value for its customers,\u201d primarily by 86ing its excellent partner award chart.\n\nHilton will raise the 150K cap on standard awards\n\nFor the first time in ages, Hilton Honors was one of the most exciting programs around in 2024. That\u2019s almost exclusively due to it wooing the affections of Small Luxury Hotels of the World (SLH) from Hyatt.\n\nThere are now over 400 participating SLH hotels that can be booked through Hilton Honors and many of them are are drool-worthy destinations which would be out of reach for most people when booking with cash. Better yet, almost all are offering standard free night awards that can be booked with points or free night certificates AND there are handsome elite benefits on offer when you do.\n\nLike Hilton\u2019s own hotels, SLH properties max out at 150,000 points per night, but many of them have cash rates that go well over $1,000 per night, a great proposition for Hilton points that we value at just under half a cent each in normal use cases. Hilton has already increased the award costs of many high-end SLH properties that it added earlier this year, as well as its own. I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before they lift the 150K ceiling as well.\n\nGreg guesses\u2026.\n\nIn 2024, my prediction success rate was awful. Sure, maybe I\u2019m bad at predicting these things, but I don\u2019t think so. I think that the powers-that-be purposely made my predictions wrong. They took a look at my 2024 predictions and said to themselves, \u201cwell, we\u2019ll have to put this off until he stops predicting it.\u201d For example, Amex was surely about to refresh the Business Green card until they saw that I predicted it. And Chase was certainly set to make the Ink Premier into a real Ink Card until they saw my prediction. And Choice delayed the ending of their 100 day award booking window until 2025 just to spite me. How do I know all this? Via the same great psychic powers that led to my 2024 predictions in the first place.\n\nNow that I understand the game, my goal for 2025 isn\u2019t to predict things correctly. Instead, I\u2019ll predict the opposite of what I want to happen to ensure those things happen.\n\nHere goes\u2026\n\nChase won\u2019t make Ink Premier a real Ink card\n\nIn 2022, Chase introduced a new Ink Business card: Ink Business Premier. At first glance, the card is fantastic. It earns 2 Ultimate Rewards points for all spend, and 2.5 points per dollar for purchases of $5,000 or more. But there\u2019s one huge problem. Unlike the Ink Business Preferred card, Ink Premier points can\u2019t be transferred to airline and hotel partners or used for extra value towards travel. And unlike the Ink Business Cash and Ink Business Unlimited cards, Ink Premier points can\u2019t be moved to other cards to make the points more valuable.\n\nMy prediction for 2025 is that this will stay unchanged. There won\u2019t be a Pinocchio-like ending for this card \u2014 at least, not in 2025.\n\nAmerican Airlines will devalue partner awards\n\nAmerican Airlines has a terrific award chart, specifically for partner awards. That award chart has been unchanged for many years now and it offers incredible value in many circumstances (see, for example: My AAdvantage love affair continues). In 2025, AA will do something to devalue these partner awards. Maybe they\u2019ll change the award chart. Maybe they\u2019ll eliminate the award chart. Maybe they\u2019ll increase fees. We\u2019ll see.\n\nCiti won\u2019t add American Airlines as a transfer partner\n\nAs we reported separately, Citibank is set to become the exclusive provider of American Airlines credit cards. That\u2019s mostly sad because it means we lose Barclays as another source for AA welcome bonuses. But the good news would be if the Citi ThankYou Rewards program gains AA as a one to one transfer partner. That may happen in 2026 or beyond, but I\u2019m predicting that it won\u2019t happen in 2025.\n\nDelta won\u2019t change their elite criteria for earning 2026 status\n\nIn 2023 (if I remember correctly), Delta massively increased requirements for earning elite status in 2024 and beyond. But after a public outcry, they rolled back the requirements to make elite status, for many, easier than ever to obtain. But they also made it clear that they still intended to go to those higher elite requirements eventually, and everyone thought we only had a one year grace period. Now, as I write this, though, we haven\u2019t heard a peep from Delta about changes to the requirements for earning 2026 elite status (In 2025 we work towards earning 2026 status, so it\u2019s surprising we haven\u2019t heard anything yet!). However, since the 2024 elite year ends January 31 2025, Delta still has a month to make changes.\n\nMy prediction is that they won\u2019t make any changes right now. In other words, the requirements for earning elite status in 2025 for the 2026 elite year will be the same as they were in 2024 for the 2025 elite year.\n\nOops\u2026 I just remembered that I was supposed to predict things that I don\u2019t want to happen. Here I did the opposite! Crossing my fingers that Delta doesn\u2019t read this!\n\nStephen foresees\u2026.\n\nBilt will make a major credit card change\n\nBilt\u2019s relationship with Wells Fargo made news this past year due to a newspaper article which made it sound like Wells Fargo was unhappy with how things have been working out, with Bilt\u2019s founder Ankur Jain then sending an email to Bilt Rewards members in December suggesting that changes are coming on the Bilt Mastercard.\n\nIt might therefore seem like a bit of a cheat to guess that changes are coming on the Bilt card, but my prediction is that rather than being a handful of minor, incremental changes, there\u2019ll be at least one major change. Perhaps it\u2019ll be an announcement that Bilt will be moving on from Wells Fargo (having already moved on from Evolve Bank a couple of years ago), or perhaps the card will make some major changes to its bonused spend categories. No matter what the reason, I\u2019ve a feeling the Bilt/Wells Fargo drama is only going to continue to Bilt build.\n\nWells Fargo will add at least two new transfer partners\n\nWells Fargo launched its Autograph Journey card in 2024 with a mild pop rather than a bang or a whimper. It\u2019s a card that has potential seeing as its bonused spend categories all allow for unlimited spending and it earns points in a transferable currency. The list of transfer partners at the card\u2019s launch were underwhelming though, consisting of Air France/KLM Flying Blue, British Airways Avios, Aer Lingus Avios, Iberia Avios, Avianca LifeMiles and Choice Privileges.\n\nWells Fargo had insinuated that they were just getting started, so the expectation has been that they\u2019ll add more transfer partners at some point. I\u2019d be surprised if they were content with that lineup of partners, so I\u2019m predicting they\u2019ll add at least two more transfer partners in 2025. Having said that, I\u2019m not expecting to get overly excited by any new additions as I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they ended up being promiscuous partners like Virgin Atlantic and Singapore Airlines. Still, more is better than fewer.\n\nAnother airline will make it easier to earn status through non-flight activity\n\nThis prediction is a little annoying as it\u2019s already come true to an extent since I initially made it. I set a calendar reminder for myself with this prediction several months ago to remind me to include it in my predictions for 2025. Since then, Alaska Airlines has announced different ways that Mileage Plan members can earn towards status via non-flight means, while also announcing a premium credit card that will also provide that ability.\n\nNonetheless, I\u2019m going to maintain this even if Alaska spoiled things for me somewhat \u2013 it\u2019ll just have to be a different airline that makes it easier to earn status through other methods like credit card spend. Considering how airlines often make announcements for changes that\u2019ll be coming the following year, I\u2019d like to caveat this prediction with the proviso that I\u2019d expect an airline to announce changes in 2025 that\u2019ll take effect in 2026, rather than them necessarily bringing in the changes in 2025.\n\nA new travel business card will be launched\n\nFor me, the most likely contender would be Chase and Air Canada to launch an Aeroplan business card. Perhaps it\u2019ll be a more niche card though like an Expedia OneKey business card or a business card for Choice or Best Western.\n\nHyatt will provide the ability to transfer points online\n\nIHG, Hilton and Marriott all let you transfer points to another member for free online in one way or another. Hyatt also lets you transfer points for free to another member, but the process is more convoluted. You have to manually (or digitally) complete a form, then physically mail it or email it to Hyatt. It\u2019ll then take x number of days for them to process the request, but they won\u2019t email you to let you know it\u2019s been done \u2013 you just have to check your account intermittently to see if the points have been debited or credited.\n\nHyatt has made improvements with its IT in the last year or two though, now letting World of Hyatt members quickly and easily transfer free night certificates, suite upgrade awards, Guest of Honor awards, etc. It doesn\u2019t feel like it should be too much of a stretch for them to work out a way to finally let members transfer points online, so fingers crossed that happens in 2025 in order for this prediction to come true.\n\nCarrie forecasts\u2026\n\nThe Frequent Miler challenge will feature\u2026.\n\nWe\u2019ll go back to doing just one annual team challenge and it will feature some countries we haven\u2019t seen in challenges before. For a number of reasons, Asia always gets the lime light for our challenges (largely because of all the great miles and points opportunities for getting there and staying there.) But we are always mindful of our sort of Asia-heavy focus in challenges, and we keep trying to find ways to feature Central/South America and even Africa. To be more specific, I think this year\u2019s challenge will feature some non-Asia and non-Europe destinations.\n\nAnd the challenge will also feature\u2026\n\nStephen and Tim will get to do a team challenge at the same time\u2026 This is the prediction I\u2019m least confident about since we are trying to make sure someone other than me stays behind to help manage the blog for each challenge. But it\u2019s happened before and I think it could happen again.\n\nNick will find his sea legs again\n\nNick won\u2019t be done cruising yet, even though the free-cruise loopholes are closing. I think he\u2019s still got some cruises up his sleeve.\n\nA new country for Greg\n\nGreg will finally make it to Hong Kong, which he\u2019s as of yet still never seen! (He\u2019s gotten close!)",

Valued at a market cap of $236.8 billion, the company serves physical stores, the internet, and other distribution channels worldwide. The leading financial services company is expected to announce its fiscal fourth-quarter and FY2024 earnings on Friday, Jan. 10.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect WFC to report a profit of $1.33 per share on a diluted basis, up 3.1% from $1.29 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nWFC beat the earnings consensus estimate by 19.7% in the previous quarter, driven by lower-than-anticipated provisions for potential loan losses and a forecast that interest income would stabilize.\n\nFor the current year 2024, analysts expect WFC to report EPS of $5.44, up 5.2% from $5.17 in fiscal 2023. Its fiscal 2025 EPS is likely to rise marginally year over year to $5.49.\n\nWFC stock has climbed 43.1% over the past 52 weeks, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s ($SPX) 23.8% gains and the S&P 500 Financials Sector SPDR\u2019s (XLF) 28.4% gains over the same time frame.\n\nWells Fargo's strong performance over the past year stems from its expanded API portfolio, enhancing data transfer and order processing for commercial clients. Additionally, Federal Reserve rate cuts are expected to boost its net interest income.\n\nWells Fargo's shares surged 17.3% in November, outpacing major peers, as investor optimism grew following Donald Trump's election and Republican majorities in Congress. Anticipation of regulatory relief, including eased capital requirements and less opposition to mergers and acquisitions, bolstered sentiment. Additionally, expectations for sustained low corporate tax rates under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contributed to the rally.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 consensus opinion on WFC stock is moderately optimistic, with a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall.

            "content": "Wells Fargo has to pay nearly $3.4 million to the estate of an elderly investor who accused the firm and one of its advisors of failing to prevent the client from being taken advantage of by her nieces.\n\nLast Thursday, a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel hit Wells Fargo Clearing Services \u2014 the official name of Wells Fargo Advisors \u2014 and its advisor Stephen L. Smith with a roughly $3.37 million award over alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and contract, negligence and other violations. The complaints against Wells were brought by the estate of Genell Mathis, a wealthy client who built much of her fortune through early investments in the insurance giant Aflac. Mathis, a lifetime resident of Columbus, Georgia, died in 2020.\n\nMathis's lawyers, Tyler Pritchard and Rhett Owens of the Bodewell Injury Group law firm in Birmingham, Alabama, said the claims arose after Mathis was convinced by her two nieces that she could lower her estate taxes by transferring to them and other relatives more than 70,000 of her Aflac shares. After learning the transfers would not have the promised benefits, Mathis sought to reclaim the stock only to see her requests refused.\n\nThe lawyers said the share transfers were uncharacteristic of Mathis and, at the very least, should have been given close scrutiny by Wells Fargo and Smith. Instead, the firm and advisor allowed the transactions to proceed as if nothing was amiss.\n\n\" Wells Fargo contemplated a number of facts that were suggestive of the exploitation of an elderly client and ignored those facts,\" Pritchard said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n'Daughter they never had' accused of defrauding elderly clients\n\nAs elder fraud explodes, banks beat back duty to call cops\n\nTD Ameritrade to pay $100K for not stopping elder fraud\n\nSuit: Schwab should and could have stopped elder gold bar scam\n\nAI-washing, elder fraud, reg rollback: 5 big compliance trends in 2024\n\nOwens said Wells Fargo has policies listing telltale indicators of likely elder fraud.\n\n\"A family member suddenly becomes interested in a client's finances or there are some large sudden transactions that don't make business sense,\" he said. \"These are the warning signs of financial exploitation, and yet Wells Fargo didn't do anything about it.\"\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesperson said, \"We take the protection of our clients seriously, and we respectfully disagree with the panel's decision.\"\n\nPritchard said Mathis was a wealthy woman who got her start in the grocery business. She was an early investor in Aflac, which has its headquarters in Columbus, Georgia, buying shares from the firm's founder in the 1970s when he was selling them from his truck.\n\n\"She knew a good deal when she saw one and liked the stock and held onto it,\" Pritchard said. \"It made her wealthy.\"\n\nPritchard and Owens said Mathis had apparently not included her nieces \u2014 whom they declined to name \u2014 in her will. Mathis was also known to be averse to paying taxes, making her susceptible to ploys ostensibly aimed at lowering her tax burden.\n\n\"She unequivocally loved and trusted these nieces,\" Owens said. He said the nieces used the trust placed in them and their knowledge of their aunt's aversion to taxes \"to try to enrich themselves.\"\n\nPritchard and Owens said Mathis's estate was able to recover about 26,000 Aflac shares in a lawsuit filed in state court in Georgia and settled in February 2023. That left roughly 28,800 shares still in the nieces' possession, the lawyers said.\n\nAll told, Pritchard said the estate sought $4.1 million on the behalf of Mathis. That figure was based partly on the current value of the Aflac shares still with the nieces. Also included was $68,000 in capital gains taxes Mathis had to pay after her nieces initiated sales of Invesco mutual funds she held in her account, as well as $350,000 in dividends she forfeited through those sales.\n\nIn the end, the three-member FINRA arbitration panel ruling on the case provided the Mathis estate with nearly $3.3 million in compensatory damages, $17,500 to cover expert fees and $625 to cover an initial filing fee. As often happens in such cases, the arbitrators did not explain the reasons for their decisions or the award amounts they approved.\n\nInvestor advocates often warn of the dangers of so-called affinity fraud. This occurs when ill-intentioned parties use something they have in common with an intended victim \u2014 such as a familial relationship or racial or ethnic ties \u2014 to gain trust in a way that may not be granted a perceived outsider.\n\nIn an investor alert dating back a decade, the Securities and Exchange Commission listed some of the hallmark signs of affinity frauds.\n\n\"Even if you know the person making the investment offer, be sure to research the person's background, as well as the investment itself \u2014 no matter how trustworthy the person who brings the investment opportunity to your attention seems to be,\" the SEC warned.\n\nOne particularly susceptible group, according to the SEC, is the elderly . Many infamous cases of affinity fraud involve relatives or supposed friends of older investors who exploit the trust that has been placed in them to pursue nefarious purposes.\n\nThe larger plague of elder fraud has been estimated by the AARP to cost people 60 and older $28.3 billion annually. Wells Fargo , Charles Schwab and other large firms have been accused in recent years of ignoring obvious red flags that their elderly clients were being defrauded and of failing to take simple steps to prevent investor harm.\n\n\"In the grand scheme of things, this is a judgment concerning elder financial exploitation,\" Owens said. \" Wells Fargo had policies and procedures to help prevent this. But those policies and procedures need to be followed and followed strictly as it relates to these elderly investors, for the firms' own protection.\"\n\nPritchard and Owens noted that FINRA rules allow brokerage clients to designate trusted contact persons who can be consulted should concerns about fraud arise. In Mathis's case, her son, Tony, was named as that type of a contact. But Wells had apparently not placed his name on every account she had at the firm and did not reach out to him.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, the FINRA arbitration panel denied Smith's request that a record of the complaint be removed from the information appearing on FINRA's online BrokerCheck database . Smith has 13 years of industry experience, having begun his career at Wells in 2011. Besides the complaint stemming from the Mathis case, he has no other disclosures on his record.\n\n- This article has been revised with a comment from Wells Fargo.",

College Ave., a Denver-based development firm has purchased the former bank building with plans to restore it \"back to its former glory.\"\n\nRevesco Properties, a real estate investment and development firm, bought the 34,000-square-foot midcentury office building for $2.6 million in early December, Larimer County property records show.\n\nThe firm plans to restore the main bank building back into \"one of the preeminent office addresses on College Avenue,\" Revesco CEO Rhys Duggan told the Coloradoan on Monday. The western parcel of the property \u2014 formerly home to a drive-up banking center \u2014 is the proposed future home of a mixed-use multifamily development, Duggan added.\n\nA conceptual review application submitted to the city of Fort Collins by Revesco Properties this fall show initial concept designs for a 113,000-square-foot multifamily building with 120- to 160-units and 4,800 square feet of retail space on the property's western parcel. It is set to be developed under akin, a development subsidiary of Revesco Properties and Alpine Investments, Duggan said.\n\nThe main bank building at 401 S. College Ave. \u2014 described as \"an important legacy structure\" \u2014 will undergo substantial interior renovations that will respect its 1960s architectural style, according to the conceptual review application.\n\nHow the other half lives: Here are the most expensive homes sold in Larimer County in 2024\n\nOriginally built to house Poudre Valley National Bank, the 1967 grand opening of 401 S.

Mountain Ave., according to Coloradoan reports at the time.\n\nThrough a rebranding and succession of mergers and acquisitions, the building later became home to United Bank of Fort Collins, Norwest and, ultimately, Wells Fargo.\n\nWells Fargo closed its office at 401 S. College Ave. in September 2022 and opened a new branch across the street at 460 S.

The following IRAs are available:\n\nWells Fargo Custodial (UGMA/UTMA) Accounts\n\nInvest on behalf of your child with a Wells Fargo Intuitive Investors custodial account.

There's also an annual advisory fee of 0.35% of your total account balance.\n\nInvestors who link their account to an existing Wells Fargo checking account pay only a 0.30% fee. Accounts linked to a Premier or Private Bank Interest Checking account only pay a 0.25% annual advisory fee.\n\nETF expense ratios range from 0.07% to 0.14% and vary based on the kinds of ETFs in your investment portfolio.\n\nWells Fargo Intuitive Investors Trustworthiness\n\nWells Fargo has an F rating with the Better Business Bureau. The BBB gives businesses grades ranging from A+ to F. Ratings represent how well a company interacts with its customers, and Wells Fargo has received the lowest possible score.\n\nThe BBB states that the low rating is due to Wells Fargo's failure to respond to customer complaints and government actions against the business.\n\nFebruary 2024, Amanda Gonzales, a schoolteacher in New Mexico, filed a class-action lawsuit after the bank sent customers opaque-sounding letters to contact the bank if they had enrolled in unwanted products. The lawsuit alleges that Wells Fargo is violating the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and California and New Mexico consumer protection laws by attempting to sweep intentional misconduct under the rug. It's seeking at least $5 million for affected customers. Wells Fargo has yet to respond to these allegations.\n\nIn 2022, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Wells Fargo of wrongfully charging users fees that led to the loss of homes and vehicles. The bank was also accused of wrongfully charging various checking and savings account overdraft fees. Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $3.7 billion settlement.\n\nWells Fargo Intuitive Investors Alternatives\n\nWells Fargo Intuitive Investors vs. Betterment\n\nWells Fargo Intuitive Investors and Betterment Investing are both beginner-friendly robo-advisors for trading ETFs and tax-loss harvesting. But they differ in fees, investment options, and account benefits.\n\nBetterment has a drastically lower account minimum, only requiring $10 to start investing, compared to Wells Fargo's $500 minimum. Betterment also offers crypto trading. However, cryptocurrencies and access to CFPs are only available under the premium plan, which requires a minimum balance of $100,000.\n\nIf unlimited access to human financial planners is important, Wells Fargo Intuitive Investors is a better, more affordable option.\n\nBetterment review\n\nWells Fargo Intuitive Investors vs. Vanguard Personal Advisor\n\nLike Wells Fargo Intuitive Investors, Vanguard Personal Advisor is a hybrid robo-advisor and professional management account. It has a high Vanguard Personal Advisor minimum balance requirement. Both platforms offer the convenience of a robo-advisor with the benefit of personalized guidance from a human advisor.\n\nIntuitive Investors is the overall better option for beginners as its streamlined investing options and low minimum balance requirement make it more readily available for those just starting out.\n\nAlthough it doesn't as many trading tools as Vanguard, automated investing with Wells Fargo Intuitive Investor still gets you access to valuable features like tax-loss harvesting and dividend reinvesting.\n\nVanguard Personal Advisor is better for retirement-focused investors with larger balances. The higher your account balance with Vanguard, the lower the fees. Plus, the most beneficial features and resources available through a Personal Advisor account are centered on retirement.\n\nVanguard Personal Advisor review\n\nWells Fargo Intuitive Investors FAQs\n\nWhat is Wells Fargo Intuitive Investor, and what services does it offer?

Lower interest rates mean better net interest income (NII) for Wells Fargo because customers will be less likely to move their money into higher-yielding accounts. Donald Trump's presidential election victory in November propelled shares further on the odds of a more lenient regulatory environment for the financial sector. This includes fewer hurdles for mergers and acquisitions, a lower level of rainy-day capital that big banks must hold in reserves, and potentially even the removal of Wells Fargo's $1.95 trillion asset cap . Throughout the year, shares were sensitive to news on Wells Fargo's progress with its past regulatory misdeeds. The stock surged earlier this year after regulators lifted a key penalty tied to its 2016 fake accounts scandal. The day before that announcement, on Feb. 14, Wells Fargo stock closed at $48.53 a share. It hasn't closed below $50 since. The stock hit an all-time intraday high of over $78 on Nov. 26. As of Monday's late afternoon trading, shares have dropped 9.5% since then. '25 look ahead Jim Cramer said 2025 could be \"a much better year\" for Wells Fargo, even after its 2024 performance exceeded expectations. Jim named the bank as a core holding . Lifting the asset cap was always a \"when, not if\" situation. But the Street believes it might happen quicker under Trump than it would have otherwise. Once that is gone, Wells Fargo will be able to grow its balance sheet past the nearly $2 trillion threshold, allowing it to hold more customer deposits and invest more in high-growth areas of the business like investment banking, which CEO Charlie Scharf has already been doing. All of the regulatory progress made under Scharf in his five years at the helm, coupled with the upcoming change in the White House, bodes well for the asset cap removal. \"It will soon be seven years since [then-Fed Chair] Janet Yellen decided to slap sanctions on Wells Fargo. In that time, we have discovered that Charlie Scharf \u2014 who came from outside the organization [and] had nothing to do with what went wrong \u2014 has had to deal with multiple strictures and penalties from regulators, many of which he didn't even know existed when he took the job,\" Jim said during the Investing Club's December Monthly Meeting . \"The idea that this foolishness by the regulators can continue in 2025 is actually pretty unfathomable, and while Wells Fargo has been able to do a lot despite a cap on its activities, it would be inconceivable that [lifting the restriction] will not matter to the stock.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long WFC.

            "content": "Key Takeaways Some economists foresee a \u201csoft landing\u201d in 2025, with inflation moving lower while the economy remains robust and unemployment stays low.\n\nHowever, some predict a \u201cno landing\u201d scenario where the economy remains strong but inflationary pressures remain high.\n\nWhile economists see a recession as unlikely, some said policy changes like higher tariffs could weigh on economic growth.\n\nCan price pressures return to normal in 2025 without a jump in unemployment? If they do, it could mean the \u201csoft landing\u201d investors and economists have been watching for.\n\nFor the past two years, the Federal Reserve has worked to tame inflation and cool down the economy without tipping it into a recession. While the central bank didn't reach its annual goal of 2% inflation in 2024, it did keep a lid on unemployment, and the economy continued its growth. Some economists remain hopeful a soft landing could arrive in the new year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that we're in this soft landing phase where U.S. economic growth remains resilient through 2025,\u201d said Ashish Shah, chief investment officer of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nTracking the Chance of a Soft Landing\n\nEconomists look at inflation, the labor market, gross domestic product (GDP) and other economic indicators when watching for a soft landing.\n\nAccording to calculations by Wells Fargo, the probability of a soft landing increased two percentage points from their last estimate to 42% when taking into account third-quarter data. Meanwhile, the probability of a recession decreased by the same amount, to 28%.\n\nTheir research also examined another possibility: stagflation, in which inflation rises along with the unemployment rate. The probability of that scenario was lower than the odds of a recession.\n\nInflation Still Needs to Fall. What If It Doesn't?\n\nThe Federal Reserve needs price pressures to slow in 2025 to achieve a soft landing. Some forecasts indicate that the risk of inflation from President-elect Donald Trump's policies could exacerbate already stubborn inflation.\n\n\u201cTariffs stand to throw some sand in the gears of economic growth next year and stymie inflation's return to the Federal Reserve's target,\u201d said a Wells Fargo note from a group of analysts headed by Chief Economist Jay Bryson.\n\nIn addition to stubborn inflation, many economists think economic growth will remain strong, the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated, and tariffs are likely to raise prices. That could create a situation in which there's no landing at all.\n\n\u201cInstead of landing, the U.S. economy may simply refuel next year,\u201d wrote Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO.\n\nWhat About a Recession?\n\nA soft landing would be a rarity for the Federal Reserve. Out of the last nine times the Fed raised rates, a recession ensued after eight, according to analysis by Piper Sandler. However, this time, a recession is not an outcome that most economists think is likely.\n\n\u201cOur suite of recession models showed the lowest probability of recession at the three- and six-month horizons in more than two years,\u201d wrote Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n\nHowever, uncertainty around the economy, especially over the impact of tariffs, could mean that economic growth comes in lower than expected.\n\n\u201cA hard landing, or recession, is not our base case, but the risk of such a scenario would rise in the event of severe disruptions to global trade,\u201d wrote Wells Fargo.\n\n",

Despite this, banks are having enough room to grow further.\n\nBanks have been adopting digital technologies to enhance their client experience and online presence to capture a rising mobile banking population. Buyouts and collaborative efforts to deepen global presence and diversify revenue streams will further bolster fee incomes. Thus, in 2025, banking firms are likely to benefit from their efforts to boost NII and fee income.\n\nAs interest rates keep decreasing, it will lead funding/deposit costs to gradually stabilize and then decline. This will support expansions in banks' net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM). Moreover, the U.S. presidential election results fueled the optimism around banks on anticipated tax cuts, favorable regulations and expansionary fiscal measures, stimulating economic growth.\n\nAdditionally, several banks have increased their capital distribution activities after the clearance of the 2024 stress test. Banks have also made efforts to diversify their revenue streams to reduce the dependency on spread income. Lately, several banks are acquiring or forming partnerships to strengthen non-interest income. Banks are venturing into the lucrative private credit business to capitalize on the growing demand for alternative financing options. These boosted investors\u2019 sentiment, reinforcing confidence in the banking sector's stability.\n\nAs we approach 2024 end, it is time to look back at how this year has fared for banking stocks. Major banks like Wells Fargo & Company WFC, Citigroup, Inc. C and Bank of America BAC rose more than 30% in 2024.\n\nHowever, as inflation was high and did not decline as anticipated, the euphoria surrounding interest rate reduction progressively waned. This led to uncertainty regarding the pace of rate cuts. Though the Fed has reduced interest rates by 100 basis points since September, it has hinted at fewer cuts for 2025. Despite this, the rate cut spree announced by the Fed has kept banking stocks in focus.\n\nThe U.S. economy got off to a good start in 2024, thanks to a robust labor market, increased consumer spending, technological advancements and optimism over potentially faster interest cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWells Fargo: The company is diverging revenue sources and reducing its reliance on NII. It has been methodically strengthening its corporate investment bank as it sees significant growth opportunities.\n\nWFC significantly raised advisor retention in its wealth and investment management division, and emphasized serving its consumer banking clients and independent advisers, both of which should eventually spur development. The company's goals in the Commercial Bank division are to expand its treasury management business and provide clients with its investment banking and market capabilities.\n\nAt the Goldman Sachs 2024 U.S. Financial Services Conference held on Dec. 11, Wells Fargo\u2019s CEO Charlie Scharf expressed confidence in the bank's progress to fix compliance problems following its years-long fake account scandal, detailing its efforts to implement risk controls. Last month, Reuters reported that WFC is in the final stages of meeting its regulatory requirements to remove the $1.95-trillion asset cap. This asset cap was imposed in 2018 following the revelation of its fake account scandal. Per the report, the asset cap could be removed in the first half of 2025, provided that the bank resolves its risk management and compliance issues. However, the decision to lift the restriction would require voting from the Federal Reserve's board of governors.\n\nGiven that loans are among a bank's largest assets, lifting the asset cap will mark a turning point for Wells Fargo. This will allow the bank to offer loans without restrictions, supporting its top-line expansion and long-term growth.\n\nWells Fargo's NII and NIM have been subdued by the increased funding costs as the high-interest rate environment weighed on it. Management expects 2024 NII to drop 9% from the year-ago period. However, with the central bank expected to keep lowering interest rates, it will support NIM expansion going forward.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings per share has been pegged at $5.28 and $5.49, implying a 2.8% year-over-year decline and 4% growth, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC\u2019s 2024 and 2025 revenues has been pegged at $82.6 billion and $83.6 billion, suggesting a 0.02% year-over-year increase and 1.2% growth, respectively.\n\nWFC currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nCitigroup: This globally diversified financial services holding company\u2019s CEO, Jane Fraser, is executing a sweeping overhaul of the bank to enhance its performance, reduce costs and simplify business operations.\n\nThe transformation process includes an organizational restructuring. In sync with this, in January 2024, C announced the plan to eliminate 20,000 jobs as part of its broad-scale restructuring effort over the next two years.\n\nCitigroup continues to emphasize growth in core businesses through streamlining consumer banking operations globally. In sync with this, recently, the company completed the separation of its institutional banking business in Mexico from its consumer, small and middle-market businesses in December 2024. It also sold its China-based onshore consumer wealth portfolio to HSBC China in June 2024, winding down its U.K. retail banking business, and expanding personal banking and wealth management in the region.\n\nWith such optimization of management layers and reduction in functional roles, along with the bank\u2019s consumer banking divesture efforts, the company projects revenues to see a compounded annual growth rate of 4-5% and annualized run rate savings of $2-$2.5 billion by 2026 end.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, NII declined 2% from the year-ago period. NIM declined to 2.33% in the third quarter of 2024 from 2.41% in the second quarter of 2024 and 2.42% in the first quarter of 2024. With a decline in interest rates, funding costs will stabilize and decline eventually. This will support Citigroup\u2019s NII and NIM growth in the upcoming period.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for C\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings per share has been pegged at $5.88 and $7.21, indicating a 2.7% year-over-year decline and 22.6% growth, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for C\u2019s 2024 and 2025 revenues has been pegged at $81 billion and $83.3 billion, implying a 3.2% year-over-year increase and 2.8% growth, respectively.\n\nCitigroup currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\n\nBank of America: One of the largest financial holding companies in the United States, BAC is expected to benefit from the current high-rate regime and decent loan demand.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, Bank of America is expected to witness improvements in NII and net interest yield, going forward. At present, both are under pressure because of the drastic rise in funding costs due to four-decade-high interest rates. Management expects NII in the fourth quarter of 2024 to improve sequentially and expand further next year.\n\nThe bank embarked on an ambitious expansion plan to open financial centers in new and existing markets. By 2026, it plans to expand its financial center network into nine new markets. The bank is committed to providing modern and state-of-the-art financial centers through ongoing renovation and modernization projects.\n\nBank of America is focused on acquiring the industry's best deposit franchise and strengthening the loan portfolio. Despite a challenging operating environment, deposits and loan balances have been solid in the past several years. As of Sept. 30, 2024, the company\u2019s net loans and leases were $1.06 trillion, increasing modestly from the end of September 2023. While the tough macroeconomic scenario has been creating headwinds, the demand for loans is projected to be decent in the quarters ahead.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAC\u2019s 2024 and 2025 earnings per share has been pegged at $3.27 and $3.67, indicating a 4.4% year-over-year decline and 12.3% year-over-year growth, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAC\u2019s 2024 and 2025 revenues has been pegged at $101.8 billion and $106.5 billion, suggesting a 3.3% year-over-year increase and 4.6% year-over-year growth, respectively.\n\nThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Re is trying to arm the industry with the good-old safety net of insurance.\n\nA few years ago, the use cases made public for AI were few and far between, but this has changed rapidly as the understanding of the technology has improved among enterprises, with widespread use of different forms of AI.\n\nIn contrast, a technology that still leaves people scratching their heads is quantum computing. The technology promises to transform humanity, but try explaining how to the person on the street, or even in business.\n\nThe technology is theoretical at the moment, but banking industry trade association UK Finance has warned banks to get up to speed.\n\nIt may appear old hat these days with quantum computing and GenAI stealing the headlines, but banks still have lots to do to fully harness these technologies\u2019 advantages.
